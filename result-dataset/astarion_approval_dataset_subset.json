If the Moonmaiden didn't strike me dead for blessing you, she must rather approve of this little alliance.\nIsobel: This will block the lesser effects of the shadow curse, allowing you to traverse the darkness outside... should Shar's own protection falter, that is.\nIsobel: Curious.

I wonder why.\nPlayer: I don't know what to make of it myself.\nIsobel: I suppose Shar is nothing if not mysterious.\nIsobel: I'll stop needling you, though. You have more important things to do, after all.\nPlayer: I do, though I already have a Moonlantern.\nPlayer: I already have a Moonlantern. I can safely travel the shadows.\nIsobel: Well! Now you have two. Just in case.\nIsobel: I wish you luck. The very best of it.\nPlayer: Wait - Marcus is a True Soul, you know. And not the good kind, like me.",

An old hunter's trick - most monsters will think twice before making a meal of me.\nAstarion: You're a monster hunter? I'm surprised - I thought all Gur were vagrant cut-throats.\nPlayer: I knew you were a jackass, but a racist? I'm shocked.\nGandrel: Your friend has just heard the rumours of my people. That we steal chickens, curse your crops, seduce your daughters...\nGandrel: I wish I had half the power settled folk think my people possess. Alas, I am a simple wanderer.\nGandrel: A simple wanderer and monster hunter. But I'm no witchdoctor or cut-throat.\nPlayer: I assume you want to kill the hag?\nAstarion: Or to make a deal with her. Probably think you can outfox the old dear.\nGandrel: Right, but very wrong. My prey is a vampire spawn - much less impressive than the beast that lives here.\nGandrel: His name is Astarion, but I fear he's gone to ground. I hope the hag of these lands can help me flush him out, if I can afford her blood price.\nNodeContext: The hag's 'blood price' is likely to be something that'll cost him dearly.\nPlayer: Only a spawn? Pity. Not like it's a real vampire.\nAstarion: I don't know. I'm sure a vampire spawn could still rip your throat out if he felt like it.\nGandrel: He is right, unfortunately. They are only weak when compared to their masters.\nGandrel: During the day, we have the advantage. But at night, when they hunt? You will not find a more deadly quarry.\nPlayer: Yes, I'm sure they can creep right up on you.\nAstarion: We've all survived so far. Let's focus on that.\nGandrel: It would still be wise to post guards at night. The threat is real.\nAstarion: Indeed it is. We should do something about this threat.\nPlayer: We'll be careful, but we should get going.\nAstarion: Don't you think we should do something about the... vampire issue?\nPlayer: Fine. This is Astarion, the vampire spawn you're hunting.",

Your breath catches, your pulse quickens.*\nPlayer: Grab the stake and drive it into his heart.\n: False\nAstarion: Wretch!\nAstarion had been leaning over a prone player, drinking their blood, but they just tried to stab him in the chest.

I was hoping the hag of these lands could help me flush him out, but it seems she is no more.\nPlayer: Only a spawn? Pity. Not like it's a real vampire.\nAstarion: I don't know. I'm sure a vampire spawn could still rip your throat out if he felt like it.\nGandrel: He is right, unfortunately. They are only weak when compared to their masters.\nGandrel: During the day, we have the advantage. But at night, when they hunt? You will not find a more deadly quarry.\nPlayer: Yes, I'm sure they can creep right up on you.\nAstarion: We've all survived so far. Let's focus on that.\nGandrel: It would still be wise to post guards at night. The threat is real.\nAstarion: Indeed it is.

Let me tell you what I know.\nHalsin: I've been studying these parasites for a while now. Ever since I discovered these so-called True Souls are infected with them.\nHalsin: Someone is using very powerful magic to modify these tadpoles. They are using them to exert control over the infected.\nHalsin: I'm sorry to say, I can't undo that magic, which means I can't cure you. But that doesn't mean I can't help.\nHalsin: I didn't find what I came here for - a way to remove the tadpoles - but I found the next best thing. I found out where they come from.\nHalsin: That must be where these enchantments are placed on them, and it's where you'll find your cure.\nPlayer: You learned all this from your studies?\nHalsin: Indeed. After we dealt with the drow that ambushed us, Nettie and I were able to inspect the corpse - and the creature that slithered out of it.\nHalsin: I had no idea anyone beyond their ranks was infected. You have my sincere sympathies.\nPlayer: This magic you mentioned - it isn't normal for these parasites?\nPlayer: What should I do?\nHalsin: I overheard that the cultists are sending all of their captives to Moonrise Towers.\nHalsin: Innocents go in, True Souls come out. Given that all of these True Souls are infected, it has to be the source of this magic.\nHalsin: If you want to find a cure, you must head there and discover how the tadpoles are being manipulated.\nPlayer: At least I know what to do now. Thank you.\nHalsin: Wait - I could help you find a cure... but I need to settle matters here first.\nHalsin: I've no right to ask more of you... but if you could help me, I'd be free to join your journey to Moonrise.\nHalsin: I cannot allow these butchers to threaten my grove. The natural order must be protected.\nPlayer: Kagha was swayed by Shadow Druids. She nearly sealed the grove.\nHalsin: Kagha... I should have suspected she'd take things too far. I'll deal with her when I can.\nHalsin: But there are other matters to attend to before that.\nHalsin: Chaos is welcome, in doses; it helps keep balance. But this is too much - this is unnatural.\nHalsin: It's too late to merely kill this horde's leadership - their forces are already marching. If you want me to help, you need to help me first.\nHalsin: You must get ahead of them, muster the defences.\nPlayer: Very well. I'll go rescue the grove.",

Considering our... shared affliction, I think you know the rest.\nPlayer: Shadowheart? Interesting. Would've pegged you for a 'Molly', myself.\nShadowheart: A haunting pack of voices almost drove me to murder you, and my name is strange?\nShadowheart: We find a healer - fast. We can't have much time left before ceremorphosis takes hold.\nPlayer: We need only find my kin. They will have a cure.\nShadowheart: They do? I... well. That's curious.\nPlayer: You seem uncomfortable around my kind - why?\nShadowheart: No offence, but my first experience with your kind was one of your dragons nearly roasting me alive.\nShadowheart: And your fellow gith stares at me like she's contemplating how my heart tastes.\nPlayer: 'We'? You tried to kill me, remember? I didn't agree to a partnership.\nShadowheart: Neither of us agreed to a lot of what's happened lately. Perhaps together, we can change that.\nPlayer: Or perhaps I was mistaken, keeping your around.",

Regretting it yet?\nWulbren Bongle: I spent a lot of time thinking of worst case scenarios while I was locked in that cell you plucked me out of at Moonrise.\nWulbren Bongle: I didn't imagine anything as bad as this. The Gondians have handed Enver Gortash the means to bring about the end of liberty in Baldur's Gate.\nWulbren Bongle: And the citizens have rolled out the red carpet for their new tyrant.\nWulbren Bongle: Resistance fighters are few and far between - my Ironhands, what's left of the Harpers, and you. I hope.\nPlayer: Gortash is a dead man - I have reasons of my own for taking him down.\nWulbren Bongle: As long as our objective is the same, the reason doesn't matter to me. We have a common enemy.\nWulbren Bongle: But neither of us gets what we want until we deal with our biggest obstacle.\nWulbren Bongle: The Steel Watch. They're a threat to you, me - and every man, woman and child in the city.\nWulbren Bongle: They act all civilised... servants of the people. But they only serve one man.\nWulbren Bongle: When he becomes Grand Duke, it will only get worse. Laws will change, freedoms will vanish, and soon you'll be accused and sentenced before you've even committed a crime.\nWulbren Bongle: And the fucking Gondians are to blame for all of it.\nPlayer: Perhaps the Gondians were infected with a tadpole?\nWulbren Bongle: Perhaps. All the more reason to get rid of them.\nWulbren Bongle: They invented the Steel Watchers. And they're building an army of them.\nWulbren Bongle: They've always been happy to provide their technology to despots in exchange for a stipend and the freedom to work in peace.\nWulbren Bongle: They would have licked Sarevok's boots given the chance, and now they'll kiss Gortash's ring while the city screams.\nWulbren Bongle: I had a plan to put a stop to them. But the way things are now, if we stick our heads above ground, the Watchers are on us like flies on shit.\nPlayer: What was the plan?\nWulbren Bongle: Same as it always is. Eliminate the threat.\nWulbren Bongle: In this case - the foundry where these atrocities are produced.\nWulbren Bongle: The Gondians are ingenious. But we're more than equal to them - there's nothing they can build that the Ironhands can't tear down.\nWulbren Bongle: I've built something unique for just that purpose.\nWulbren Bongle: A runepowder bomb - first of its kind. Fifty wizards high on the Weave couldn't summon this kind of firepower.\nWulbren Bongle: Get the bomb inside the Gondian facility, and - boom. Problem solved.\nBarcus Wroot: Wulbren, please. This is too far! Everyone in the foundry would be killed.\nWulbren Bongle: Quiet, Barcus. The adults are talking.\nPlayer: This plan seems a bit loud for my liking. Messy, too.\nBarcus Wroot: That's what I've been saying! There may yet be a peaceful solution.\nWulbren Bongle: Fine. You want to try flapping your gums in the belly of the beast, be my guest.\nWulbren Bongle: But their idea of diplomacy is a steel fist shoved where the sun don't shine.\nWulbren Bongle: So take the bomb. Just in case I'm right, and you're wrong.\nPlayer: Keep your bomb. I'm doing this my way.",

It doesn't hurt to ponder the question, though.\nAstarion: I don't think they'd volunteer, of course, but it doesn't make me any less curious.\nAstarion: Take Karlach, for example, her blood aged in the Hells.

We're about to unveil your destiny - you should be quivering in anticipation.\nRaphael: As you know already, your precious skin is home to one part of a contract between the archdevil Mephistopheles, and your former master, Cazador Szarr.\nRaphael: In full, the contract states that Cazador will be granted knowledge of an infernal ritual so vile it has never been performed.\nRaphael: The Rite of Profane Ascension.\nRaphael: It promises to be a marvellous ceremony. Very elaborate, incredibly ancient, and entirely diabolical.\nRaphael: If he completes the rite, he will become a new kind of being - the Vampire Ascendant.\nRaphael: All the strengths of his vampiric form will be amplified, and alongside them he will enjoy the luxuries of the living.\nRaphael: The arousals and appetites of man will return to him, and unlike you, he will have no need of a parasite to protect him from the sun.\nRaphael: But the ritual has its price, as all worthwhile things do. Lord Cazador will need to sacrifice a number of souls, including all of his vampiric spawn, if he is to ascend.\nRaphael: Imagine how he felt, then, when one of those precious spawn simply disappeared into thin air.\nRaphael: The only missing ingredient is Astarion.\nRaphael: You are the final piece he requires to complete the ritual - your scars bind you to it. Your soul will set off a very wave of death, bringing Cazador his twisted life.\nRaphael: And that, my tragic and toothsome friend, is that. Now if you'll excuse me, I have business elsewhere.\nNodeContext: [Tarik] snaps fingers at the end of the line.\nAstarion: Hmm...\nPlayer: You're... quiet. It's unsettling.\nAstarion: It's a lot to take in.\nAstarion: What do you think I should do?\nPlayer: I think you should run. If Cazador can't find you, he can't complete his ritual.\n\nAstarion: How long do you think I can run? He has eternity to find me.\nAstarion: He'll never leave me alone. I didn't think he would when I was just one more wretched toy for him to play with.\nAstarion: But if I'm the key to this power he craves, he'll hunt me to the ends of Faerûn.\nAstarion: I need to take the fight to him.\nAstarion: And I need you to help me.\nPlayer: If he comes for you, I'll defend you.

I'm Zevlor.\nZevlor: And if I'm not mistaken, you're the Blade of Frontiers.\nPlayer: Please - it's just Wyll.\nZevlor: Well met, by whatever name. Though I'm afraid that's all the welcome we can give you.\nZevlor: Whatever your business, I'd see to it quickly - the druids are forcing everyone out.\nZevlor: This attack will only strengthen their resolve.\nPlayer: I have no quarrel with druids.\nZevlor: There have been several attacks by different monsters. The druids blame us 'outsiders' for drawing them here. Nobody's welcome anymore.\nZevlor: They've started a ritual to cut the grove off from the world outside.\nZevlor: We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: What brought you here?\nZevlor: We're refugees from Elturel - we took shelter here after gnolls attacked us on the road.\nZevlor: We were bound for Baldur's Gate, and it was too late to turn back. Elturel had no place for tieflings after the Descent.\n: False\nPlayer: 'The Descent'? What is that?\nZevlor: I'm surprised you haven't heard of it.\nZevlor: The High Overseer - our grand protector - signed a pact with devils. It dragged Elturel straight to Hell.\nZevlor: Lucky for us, a group of adventurers found a way to bring the city back.\nZevlor: Afterwards, people looked at us and just saw 'devilkin'. No different from the druids here, really.\nZevlor: We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: This ritual - is there no way to convince the druids to stop it?\nZevlor: I've tried. Kagha - their new First Druid - won't even see me.\nZevlor: You, though... I know it's not your business, but she owes you for saving this place.\nZevlor: Perhaps you could persuade her. For more time to prepare, if nothing else.\nPlayer: I have my own temporal concerns. I need a healer.\nPlayer: I'll find her. And I'll speak to Kagha while I'm there.",

No!\nDrenn: You creaking old bag of shit!\nNodeContext: Drenn grabs a halberd from a surprised guard and throws it at Ketheric.\nKetheric Thorm: Hmm.\nNodeContext: KETHERIC stares at the halberd embedded in his chest in shock. Then, after a beat, he grunts in anger and pain as with one hand he grabs the halberd and pulls it free. The wound left by the blade is just a glowing purple gash, which disappears before our eyes, leaving his chest without even a scratch.\nDisciple Z'rell: I'm so sorry, my lord. She's an unbeliever - outside my control.\nNodeContext: Very apologetic - this should never have happened\nKetheric Thorm: Try again.\nNodeContext: Ketheric drops the halberd on the ground and challenges the goblin.\nKetheric Thorm: Huh.\nNodeContext: Just been stabbed, but is invulnerable.\nDrenn: No - NO!\nNodeContext: terrified - you know you're about to die\nKetheric Thorm: Dispose of the rest as you see fit.\nKetheric Thorm: Or better yet - put that True Soul to use.

    "conversation": "Wulbren Bongle: Good to see you. Wasn't sure you'd make it to the city. Regretting it yet?\nWulbren Bongle: I spent a lot of time thinking of worst case scenarios while I was locked in that cell you plucked me out of at Moonrise.\nWulbren Bongle: I didn't imagine anything as bad as this. The Gondians have handed Enver Gortash the means to bring about the end of liberty in Baldur's Gate.\nWulbren Bongle: And the citizens have rolled out the red carpet for their new tyrant.\nWulbren Bongle: Resistance fighters are few and far between - my Ironhands, what's left of the Harpers, and you. I hope.\nPlayer: I'm with you.\nWulbren Bongle: Good. We don't have a chance unless we stick together - not while the Gondians' metal monsters are patrolling the streets.\nWulbren Bongle: The Steel Watch. They're a threat to you, me - and every man, woman and child in the city.\nWulbren Bongle: They act all civilised... servants of the people. But they only serve one man.\nWulbren Bongle: When he becomes Grand Duke, it will only get worse. Laws will change, freedoms will vanish, and soon you'll be accused and sentenced before you've even committed a crime.\nWulbren Bongle: And the fucking Gondians are to blame for all of it.\nPlayer: Cheer up Wulbren. We're here to help.\nWulbren Bongle: I heard about that. You had the Harpers all excited, but there aren't many Harpers left.\nWulbren Bongle: These Steel Watchers. One of them is the equivalent of a red dragon. An army of them, well... there's never been an army of dragons.\nPlayer: I'm not scared of dragons. Or Steel Watchers.\nWulbren Bongle: There's a line where bravery becomes stupidity. You just crossed it.\nWulbren Bongle: Scared or not, you can't take down every Steel Watcher in the city. Unless you hit the people who build them - the Gondians.\nWulbren Bongle: They've always been happy to provide their technology to despots in exchange for a stipend and the freedom to work in peace.\nWulbren Bongle: They would have licked Sarevok's boots given the chance, and now they'll kiss Gortash's ring while the city screams.\nWulbren Bongle: I had a plan to put a stop to them. But the way things are now, if we stick our heads above ground, the Watchers are on us like flies on shit.\nPlayer: No plan survives contact with the enemy - unless I'm involved.\nWulbren Bongle: Exactly. You freed us from Ketheric's rotten cells - I reckon you can rid us of these Gondians just as easily.\nWulbren Bongle: You just need a little assistance, and I can provide it.\nWulbren Bongle: The Gondians are ingenious. But we're more than equal to them - there's nothing they can build that the Ironhands can't tear down.\nWulbren Bongle: I've built something unique for just that purpose.\nWulbren Bongle: A runepowder bomb - first of its kind. Fifty wizards high on the Weave couldn't summon this kind of firepower.\nWulbren Bongle: Get the bomb inside the Gondian facility, and - boom. Problem solved.\nBarcus Wroot: Wulbren, please. This is too far! Everyone in the foundry would be killed.\nWulbren Bongle: Quiet, Barcus. The adults are talking.\nPlayer: Those metal monsters spit in nature's face, but mass murder is a bit far.\nWulbren Bongle: It's liberation.\nWulbren Bongle: The Gondians picked their side the minute they took orders from Gortash.\nWulbren Bongle: If they had any courage, they'd have refused him and died like heroes, spitting in his face.\nWulbren Bongle: Now they'll die like the dogs they are.\nPlayer: I'll make contact with the Gondians - maybe they'll see reason.\nBarcus Wroot: That's what I've been saying! There may yet be a peaceful solution.\nWulbren Bongle: Fine. You want to try flapping your gums in the belly of the beast, be my guest.\nWulbren Bongle: But their idea of diplomacy is a steel fist shoved where the sun don't shine.\nWulbren Bongle: So take the bomb. Just in case I'm right, and you're wrong.\nPlayer: Keep your bomb. I'm doing this my way.",

It doesn't hurt to ponder the question, though.\nAstarion: I don't think they'd volunteer, of course, but it doesn't make me any less curious.\nAstarion: Take Wyll, for example. A man of the people, very palatable, like a sweet cider.\nAstarion: But the gith? What in the hells would she taste like?\nPlayer: I'd prefer a beer, if it's all the same to you.\nAstarion: Yes, heavens forbid we'd have an interesting conversation.\nAstarion: Still, I am intrigued by the possibilities...\nPlayer: This is still theoretical, right?\nAstarion: Absolutely. A mere thought experiment.\nAstarion: So - in the spirit of theoretical questions - if you had to take a bite from one of them, who would it be?\nPlayer: Gale, no question.\nAstarion: I'm all too familiar with Gale's blood, unfortunately.

Fresh entertainment.\nYurgir: But you're too fresh for this place, aren't you? You've got the stench of the Hells about you - the stench of home. And a whiff of the surface besides.\nYurgir: A servant of Zariel, if I'm not mistaken. I'd know the stench of her infernal machinery anywhere.\nYurgir: You trying to burrow back home, little rabbit?\nPlayer: What do you know about infernal machinery?\nYurgir: Only what I can smell. And whatever engine burns within you is grinding to an inevitable explosion. Burning and fear - you reek with it.\nYurgir: ...There's something else, almost hidden by your fear-stink... cherries, musk... and sulphur.\nNodeContext: Sniffing the air at the start, detecting something - then erupting with fury at the end on 'sulphur'.\nYurgir: Raphael! I can smell him all over you. Where is he?!\nNodeContext: Furious\nPlayer: Wait - you know Raphael?\nYurgir: That perfumed trickster swindled me - trapped me.\nPlayer: He wants you dead.\nYurgir: Where is he? Spit it out - Now.\nAstarion: What are you doing? The devil told us to kill this thing, so let's stop chatting and kill it.\nPlayer: Let's share our experiences about Raphael. Perhaps we can help each other.\nYurgir: Bargaining, are you? A Kara-Tur warlord once tried the same - I made him watch as I ate his concubines and young, then fashioned a codpiece from his skull.\nYurgir: You can't help. It's not just walls that keep me here. Not the traps, the dark or the creatures it hides. Something stronger holds me - a contract.\nYurgir: Either I fulfil the contract, die trying... or forfeit my freedom. If I leave this place now, I'll become Raphael's slave.\nPlayer: You're hardly free as it is, trapped here. Maybe you're better off indebted to Raphael.\nYurgir: You wouldn't say that if you truly knew his mind. Just listen to the terms he gave me.\nYurgir: Spill all the blood sworn to the night.\nSilence all prayers; smother each rite.\nNodeContext: singing, a cappella\nYurgir: Wander Shar's halls; hungry to slay;\nLeave no Justiciar alive to obey.\nNodeContext: singing, a cappella\nYurgir: Leave none to hear it, then be set free;\nThis song is your oath, swear, swear it to me.\nNodeContext: singing, a cappella\nNarrator: *Well, that explains where all the Dark Justiciars went.*\n: False\nYurgir: ...That's it.\nNodeContext: A little knowing (double meaning in 'that's it' - the song has ended, but he also thinks he's stumbled upon a revelation in the lyrics.)\nLae'zel: He killed Shar's faithful? Then he's due our congratulations before we butcher him.\nPlayer: That was awful - perhaps you should stick to killing.\nYurgir: Oh, I intend to. The lyrics are clear - all who hear the song must die.\nYurgir: Time to die.\nNarrator: *You feel your patron's prickling flame at the back of your mind - and its diabolic words on your tongue. It wants to help.*\nPlayer: There must be something you missed. Let me search this place for you.\n: True\nYurgir: I spent a century roaming these halls - I spilled every drop of Dark Justiciar blood that there was to spill. And you think you can do better?",

It obviously put me off your neck, but now I can't help but wonder how the others taste.\nAstarion: Not that anyone's volunteered, it's just an idle fancy.\nPlayer: I wouldn't expect any volunteers either.\nAstarion: Alas. It doesn't hurt to ponder the question, though.\nAstarion: I don't think they'd volunteer, of course, but it doesn't make me any less curious.\nAstarion: Take Shadowheart, for example. She strikes me as having a heavy, enigmatic flavour - vintage port on two legs.\nAstarion: But the gith? What in the hells would she taste like?\nPlayer: I'd prefer a beer, if it's all the same to you.\nAstarion: Yes, heavens forbid we'd have an interesting conversation.\nAstarion: Still, I am intrigued by the possibilities...\nPlayer: Could I convince you to kill someone less useful?\nAstarion: No one's getting killed, I swear. We're just two friends talking.\nAstarion: So - in the spirit of theoretical questions - if you had to take a bite from one of them, who would it be?\nPlayer: Gale, no question.\nAstarion: I'm all too familiar with Gale's blood, unfortunately. I can't recommend it.\nAstarion: But the gith? What in the hells would she taste like?\nPlayer: Something exotic, surely? An Amnan liqueur?\nAstarion: Ohh, that sounds very appealing. I'm almost convinced.\nPlayer: This is still theoretical, right?\nAstarion: Absolutely. A mere thought experiment.\nAstarion: So - in the spirit of theoretical questions - if you had to take a bite from one of them, who would it be?\nPlayer: Are you really asking which of our companions I'd eat?\nAstarion: Oh no, don't be disgusting.\nAstarion: I just mean a sip of their blood.

This is his destiny.\nRaphael: As you know already, your precious skin is home to one part of a contract between the archdevil Mephistopheles, and your former master, Cazador Szarr.\nRaphael: In full, the contract states that Cazador will be granted knowledge of an infernal ritual so vile it has never been performed.\nRaphael: The Rite of Profane Ascension.\nRaphael: It promises to be a marvellous ceremony. Very elaborate, incredibly ancient, and entirely diabolical.\nRaphael: If he completes the rite, he will become a new kind of being - the Vampire Ascendant.\nRaphael: All the strengths of his vampiric form will be amplified, and alongside them he will enjoy the luxuries of the living.\nRaphael: The arousals and appetites of man will return to him, and unlike Astarion, he will have no need of a parasite to protect him from the sun.\nRaphael: But the ritual has its price, as all worthwhile things do. Lord Cazador will need to sacrifice a number of souls, including all of his vampiric spawn, if he is to ascend.\nRaphael: Imagine how he felt, then, when one of those precious spawn simply disappeared into thin air.\nRaphael: The only missing ingredient is Astarion.\nRaphael: You are the final piece he requires to complete the ritual - your scars bind you to it.

The Gondians have handed Enver Gortash the means to bring about the end of liberty in Baldur's Gate.\nWulbren Bongle: And the citizens have rolled out the red carpet for their new tyrant.\nWulbren Bongle: Resistance fighters are few and far between - my Ironhands, what's left of the Harpers, and you. I hope.\nPlayer: This is your fight - not mine.\nWulbren Bongle: You almost sound convinced by your own rothéshit.\nWulbren Bongle: Whatever brought you to the city, you won't get anywhere while the Gondians' metal monsters are patrolling the streets.\nWulbren Bongle: The Steel Watch. They're a threat to you, me - and every man, woman and child in the city.\nWulbren Bongle: They act all civilised... servants of the people. But they only serve one man.\nWulbren Bongle: When he becomes Grand Duke, it will only get worse. Laws will change, freedoms will vanish, and soon you'll be accused and sentenced before you've even committed a crime.\nWulbren Bongle: And the fucking Gondians are to blame for all of it.\nPlayer: Cheer up Wulbren. We're here to help.\nWulbren Bongle: I heard about that. You had the Harpers all excited, but there aren't many Harpers left.\nWulbren Bongle: These Steel Watchers. One of them is the equivalent of a red dragon. An army of them, well... there's never been an army of dragons.\nPlayer: I'm sneaky - I'll keep clear of them.\nWulbren Bongle: They'll find you, and they'll kill you.\nWulbren Bongle: We need to stop them, and there's only one way to do it.\nWulbren Bongle: By hitting the Gondians. Hard.\nWulbren Bongle: They invented the Steel Watchers. And they're building an army of them.\nWulbren Bongle: They've always been happy to provide their technology to despots in exchange for a stipend and the freedom to work in peace.\nWulbren Bongle: They would have licked Sarevok's boots given the chance, and now they'll kiss Gortash's ring while the city screams.\nWulbren Bongle: I had a plan to put a stop to them. But the way things are now, if we stick our heads above ground, the Watchers are on us like flies on shit.\nPlayer: I've already run foul of the Watchers myself.\nWulbren Bongle: And yet here you are, all in one piece. Most people who cross them aren't much more than a stain on the street afterwards.\nWulbren Bongle: You can do what's needed - I'm sure of it.\nWulbren Bongle: You just need a little assistance, and I can provide it.\nWulbren Bongle: The Gondians are ingenious. But we're more than equal to them - there's nothing they can build that the Ironhands can't tear down.\nWulbren Bongle: I've built something unique for just that purpose.\nWulbren Bongle: A runepowder bomb - first of its kind. Fifty wizards high on the Weave couldn't summon this kind of firepower.\nWulbren Bongle: Get the bomb inside the Gondian facility, and - boom. Problem solved.\nBarcus Wroot: Wulbren, please. This is too far! Everyone in the foundry would be killed.\nWulbren Bongle: Quiet, Barcus. The adults are talking.\nPlayer: Those metal monsters spit in nature's face, but mass murder is a bit far.\nWulbren Bongle: It's liberation.\nWulbren Bongle: The Gondians picked their side the minute they took orders from Gortash.\nWulbren Bongle: If they had any courage, they'd have refused him and died like heroes, spitting in his face.\nWulbren Bongle: Now they'll die like the dogs they are.\nPlayer: I'll make contact with the Gondians - maybe they'll see reason.\nBarcus Wroot: That's what I've been saying! There may yet be a peaceful solution.\nWulbren Bongle: Fine. You want to try flapping your gums in the belly of the beast, be my guest.\nWulbren Bongle: But their idea of diplomacy is a steel fist shoved where the sun don't shine.\nWulbren Bongle: So take the bomb. Just in case I'm right, and you're wrong.\nPlayer: Keep your bomb. I'm doing this my way.",

Would you be interested in studying it?\nHavkelaag: A githyanki egg? What a fortuitous turn of events. I've been attempting to get my hands on one for some time now.\nHavkelaag: Would you consider parting with it?

Don't you dare consider it.\nPlayer: What are you going to do with it?\nHavkelaag: Study it, of course. Your kind have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months.\nHavkelaag: Most on this plane believe you to be innately cruel, violent beings. Evil, if you will.\nHavkelaag: As citizens of the Underdark, we face similar stigmas. Totally unfounded, of course - our natures are as unfixed as any who walk the surface.\nHavkelaag: I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: You assume my people are evil, yet your research is built on sheer superstition.\nHavkelaag: Enough of your kind have wreaked destruction on this plane for me to be confident in my assertion.\nHavkelaag: When I have a suitable sample for my study, I will, however, prove that the effects of their biological inclination are reversible.\nHavkelaag: Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach:\nHavkelaag: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue.\nHavkelaag: Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: Why follow the dogma of a draconic god?\nHavkelaag: In my years of study, they're the closest I've found to moral perfection. Only under such rigorous 'goodness' will the subject stand a chance of being cured.\nHavkelaag: My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: Your findings are irrelevant, as are the opinions of all on this kaincha plane.\nHavkelaag: Ah. A display of the well-known githyanki arrogance. I am not sure my experiment can cure that particular affliction, but give me time and I will find a way.\nHavkelaag: Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg?

I've had this condition for two centuries, but truth be told? You were my first.\nAstarion: In all these years, I've only ever fed on beasts. Drinking the blood of thinking creatures is a different thing entirely.\nAstarion: You were delectable. And now I just can't help but wonder how the others taste.\nPlayer: They might not be as open to the idea as I was.\nAstarion: Alas. It doesn't hurt to ponder the question, though.\nAstarion: I don't think they'd volunteer, of course, but it doesn't make me any less curious.\nAstarion: Take Wyll, for example. A man of the people, very palatable, like a sweet cider.\nAstarion: But the gith? What in the hells would she taste like?\nPlayer: I'd prefer a beer, if it's all the same to you.\nAstarion: Yes, heavens forbid we'd have an interesting conversation.\nAstarion: Still, I am intrigued by the possibilities...\nPlayer: This is still theoretical, right?\nAstarion: Absolutely. A mere thought experiment.\nAstarion: So - in the spirit of theoretical questions - if you had to take a bite from one of them, who would it be?\nPlayer: Gale, no question.\nAstarion: I'm all too familiar with Gale's blood, unfortunately.

No mastication required.\nAstarion: So - in the spirit of theoretical questions - if you had to take a bite from one of them, who would it be?\nPlayer: I much prefer eating flesh to blood.\nAstarion: I do appreciate your enthusiasm, but let's try to restrain ourselves a little.\nAstarion: I just mean a sip of their blood.

One should cherish all of nature's bounty... but goblin guts are quite far down the list.\nNodeContext: Hint of wry humour, Introducing himself after transforming from an owlbear and killing several goblins.\nHalsin: Not only do you speak with a bear, but you free it, too? A true friend of nature - or perhaps a lunatic.\nHalsin: Either way, I owe thanks. I am the druid Halsin.\nPlayer: Glad I could be of help.\nHalsin: I must admit, I didn't expect anyone would come to my aid. Who in their right mind would infiltrate a goblin infested temple. Unless...\nHalsin: ...Hrrm. That look in your eyes - I've seen it before. Are you feeling all right?\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Halsin raises a hand to your head, magically connecting with you (no contact). He gives an alarmed look - he knows what’s inside you\nHalsin: Oak Father preserve you, child... You're infected, aren't you? The mind flayers' spawn.\nHalsin: But... something's different. You're aware of the monster inside you. You don't bow to the Absolute, like the True Souls do...\nHalsin: How is this possible...?\nPlayer: I escaped from an illithid ship after being infected. Maybe the process was interrupted.\nHalsin: Perhaps... but I wouldn't want to place all my faith in blind luck.\nHalsin: You weren't speaking lightly when you said you needed help. Let me tell you what I know.\nHalsin: I've been studying these parasites for a while now. Ever since I discovered these so-called True Souls are infected with them.\nHalsin: Someone is using very powerful magic to modify these tadpoles. They are using them to exert control over the infected.\nHalsin: I'm sorry to say, I can't undo that magic, which means I can't cure you. But that doesn't mean I can't help.\nHalsin: I didn't find what I came here for - a way to remove the tadpoles - but I found the next best thing. I found out where they come from.\nHalsin: That must be where these enchantments are placed on them, and it's where you'll find your cure.\nPlayer: How did you come to study mind flayer parasites?\nHalsin: A drow forced me to defend myself. Afterwards, I was able to study the parasite that slithered out of the corpse, see what drives these 'True Souls'.\nHalsin: I had no idea anyone beyond their ranks was infected. You have my sincere sympathies.\nPlayer: Sympathies won't help me to survive.\nHalsin: Patience. I can't just snap my fingers... but I know where the solution almost certainly lies.\nHalsin: I overheard that the cultists are sending all of their captives to Moonrise Towers.\nHalsin: Innocents go in, True Souls come out. Given that all of these True Souls are infected, it has to be the source of this magic.\nHalsin: If you want to find a cure, you must head there and discover how the tadpoles are being manipulated.\nPlayer: Altered parasites? A cure at Moonrise Towers, maybe? Sounds like guesswork at best.\nHalsin: I'm as certain as I can be. If you have a better alternative, I won't stop you.\nHalsin: I can't stop you, in fact. Which brings me to my next problem...\nHalsin: I've no right to ask more of you... but if you could help me, I'd be free to join your journey to Moonrise.\nHalsin: I cannot allow these butchers to threaten my grove. The natural order must be protected.\nPlayer: Kagha was swayed by Shadow Druids. She nearly sealed the grove.\nHalsin: Kagha... I should have suspected she'd take things too far. I'll deal with her when I can.\nHalsin: But there are other matters to attend to before that.\nHalsin: Chaos is welcome, in doses; it helps keep balance. But this is too much - this is unnatural.\nHalsin: It's too late to merely kill this horde's leadership - their forces are already marching. If you want me to help, you need to help me first.\nHalsin: You must get ahead of them, muster the defences.\nPlayer: Very well. I'll go rescue the grove.",

    "conversation": "Raphael: Do you know what happens when a devil is struck down on this charming plane of existence?\nRaphael: It returns to the hells - to the very point where it last stood before venturing to whichever devilforsaken plane it died on.\nRaphael: In the case of our friend Yurgir, the orthon you so handily dispatched in the temple of Shar, he manifested in my House of Hope.\nRaphael: He returned to me chastened but intact, his wounds healed, his body restored.\nRaphael: He thought I would dismember him but he has his uses so instead I am reeducating him.\nAstarion: We delivered the devil. Now I want what I'm owed - we had a deal.\nRaphael: Indeed we did.

We're about to unveil your destiny - you should be quivering in anticipation.\nRaphael: Carved into that ivory skin of yours is one part of an infernal contract between the archdevil Mephistopheles and your former master, Cazador Szarr.\nRaphael: In full, the contract states that Cazador will be granted knowledge of an infernal ritual so vile it has never been performed.\nRaphael: The Rite of Profane Ascension.\nRaphael: It promises to be a marvellous ceremony. Very elaborate, incredibly ancient, and entirely diabolical.\nRaphael: If he completes the rite, he will become a new kind of being - the Vampire Ascendant.\nRaphael: All the strengths of his vampiric form will be amplified, and alongside them he will enjoy the luxuries of the living.\nRaphael: The arousals and appetites of man will return to him, and unlike Astarion, he will have no need of a parasite to protect him from the sun.\nRaphael: But the ritual has its price, as all worthwhile things do. Lord Cazador will need to sacrifice a number of souls, including all of his vampiric spawn, if he is to ascend.\nRaphael: Imagine how he felt, then, when one of those precious spawn simply disappeared into thin air.\nRaphael: The only missing ingredient is Astarion.\nRaphael: You are the final piece he requires to complete the ritual - your scars bind you to it. Your soul will set off a very wave of death, bringing Cazador his twisted life.\nRaphael: And that, my tragic and toothsome friend, is that. Now if you'll excuse me, I have business elsewhere.\nNodeContext: [Tarik] snaps fingers at the end of the line.\nAstarion: Hmm...\nPlayer: You're... quiet. It's unsettling.\nAstarion: It's a lot to take in.\nAstarion: What do you think I should do?\nPlayer: We can't let Cazador complete that ritual. He could unleash terrible horrors.\nAstarion: The end of my life among them. Just when I was starting to enjoy it.\nAstarion: He'll never leave me alone. I didn't think he would when I was just one more wretched toy for him to play with.\nAstarion: But if I'm the key to this power he craves, he'll hunt me to the ends of Faerûn.\nAstarion: I need to take the fight to him.\nAstarion: And I need you to help me.\nPlayer: If he comes for you, I'll defend you. But we're not risking an attack on his lair.\nAstarion: If you won't risk taking him on for my sake, think of the innocent souls he'll sacrifice in this ritual.\nPlayer: We're done talking about this, Astarion.

You can't blame them for Gortash's actions.\nWulbren Bongle: I can blame them for precisely that reason.\nPlayer: Well, maybe you can blame them for that.\nWulbren Bongle: Exactly.\nWulbren Bongle: They've always been happy to provide their technology to despots in exchange for a stipend and the freedom to work in peace.\nWulbren Bongle: They would have licked Sarevok's boots given the chance, and now they'll kiss Gortash's ring while the city screams.\nWulbren Bongle: I had a plan to put a stop to them. But the way things are now, if we stick our heads above ground, the Watchers are on us like flies on shit.\nPlayer: What was the plan?\nWulbren Bongle: Same as it always is. Eliminate the threat.\nWulbren Bongle: In this case - the foundry where these atrocities are produced.\nWulbren Bongle: The Gondians are ingenious. But we're more than equal to them - there's nothing they can build that the Ironhands can't tear down.\nWulbren Bongle: I've built something unique for just that purpose.\nWulbren Bongle: A runepowder bomb - first of its kind. Fifty wizards high on the Weave couldn't summon this kind of firepower.\nWulbren Bongle: Get the bomb inside the Gondian facility, and - boom. Problem solved.\nBarcus Wroot: Wulbren, please. This is too far! Everyone in the foundry would be killed.\nWulbren Bongle: Quiet, Barcus. The adults are talking.\nPlayer: Maybe the Gondians are victims, not oppressors.\nWulbren Bongle: The Gondians picked their side the minute they took orders from Gortash.\nWulbren Bongle: If they had any courage, they'd have refused him and died like heroes, spitting in his face.\nWulbren Bongle: Now they'll die like the dogs they are.\nPlayer: I'll make contact with the Gondians - maybe they'll see reason.\nBarcus Wroot: That's what I've been saying! There may yet be a peaceful solution.\nWulbren Bongle: Fine. You want to try flapping your gums in the belly of the beast, be my guest.\nWulbren Bongle: But their idea of diplomacy is a steel fist shoved where the sun don't shine.\nWulbren Bongle: So take the bomb.

Now I want what I'm owed - we had a deal.\nRaphael: Indeed we did. I discovered all there is to know about those scars of yours - it's a rather grim tale, even for my tastes.\nPlayer: Spill it - this sounds fascinating.\nAstarion: I'd appreciate a little less enthusiasm when it comes to Cazador and his horrors.\nRaphael: Oh come, Astarion. We're about to unveil your destiny - you should be quivering in anticipation.\nRaphael: Carved into that ivory skin of yours is one part of an infernal contract between the archdevil Mephistopheles and your former master, Cazador Szarr.\nRaphael: In full, the contract states that Cazador will be granted knowledge of an infernal ritual so vile it has never been performed.\nRaphael: The Rite of Profane Ascension.\nRaphael: It promises to be a marvellous ceremony. Very elaborate, incredibly ancient, and entirely diabolical.\nRaphael: If he completes the rite, he will become a new kind of being - the Vampire Ascendant.\nRaphael: All the strengths of his vampiric form will be amplified, and alongside them he will enjoy the luxuries of the living.\nRaphael: The arousals and appetites of man will return to him, and unlike Astarion, he will have no need of a parasite to protect him from the sun.\nRaphael: But the ritual has its price, as all worthwhile things do. Lord Cazador will need to sacrifice a number of souls, including all of his vampiric spawn, if he is to ascend.\nRaphael: Imagine how he felt, then, when one of those precious spawn simply disappeared into thin air.\nRaphael: The only missing ingredient is Astarion.\nRaphael: You are the final piece he requires to complete the ritual - your scars bind you to it. Your soul will set off a very wave of death, bringing Cazador his twisted life.\nRaphael: And that, my tragic and toothsome friend, is that. Now if you'll excuse me, I have business elsewhere.\nNodeContext: [Tarik] snaps fingers at the end of the line.\nAstarion: Hmm...\nPlayer: 'Hmm'? That's all you have to say?\nAstarion: I was... contemplating. It's a lot to take in.\nAstarion: What do you think I should do?\nPlayer: I think you should run. If Cazador can't find you, he can't complete his ritual.\n\nAstarion: How long do you think I can run? He has eternity to find me.\nAstarion: He'll never leave me alone. I didn't think he would when I was just one more wretched toy for him to play with.\nAstarion: But if I'm the key to this power he craves, he'll hunt me to the ends of Faerûn.\nAstarion: I need to take the fight to him.\nAstarion: And I need you to help me.\nPlayer: If he comes for you, I'll defend you. But we're not risking an attack on his lair.\nAstarion: If you won't risk taking him on for my sake, think of the innocent souls he'll sacrifice in this ritual.\nPlayer: We're done talking about this, Astarion.

One of our most reliable contractors, though unfortunately this particular request was too much even for her.\nHavkelaag: I believe she quite lost her senses over the task.

Don't you dare consider it.\nPlayer: What are you going to do with it?\nHavkelaag: Study it, of course. Your kind have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months.\nHavkelaag: Most on this plane believe you to be innately cruel, violent beings. Evil, if you will.\nHavkelaag: As citizens of the Underdark, we face similar stigmas. Totally unfounded, of course - our natures are as unfixed as any who walk the surface.\nHavkelaag: I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: You're letting your personal biases affect your method. Why assume they're evil?\nHavkelaag: I assume nothing. Innate githyanki cruelty is an established fact - no doubt you witnessed it yourself in the retrieval of the egg itself.\nHavkelaag: When I have a suitable sample for my study, I will, however, prove that the effects of their biological inclination are reversible.\nHavkelaag: Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach:\nHavkelaag: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue.\nHavkelaag: Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: This experiment is exactly the kind of evil you're trying to disprove.\nHavkelaag: The pursuit of knowledge is neither evil nor good. Only in the application of such knowledge should one take on any moral imperative.\nHavkelaag: My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: Your findings are irrelevant, as are the opinions of all on this kaincha plane.\nHavkelaag: Ah. A display of the well-known githyanki arrogance. I am not sure my experiment can cure that particular affliction, but give me time and I will find a way.\nHavkelaag: Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg?

Now I want what I'm owed - we had a deal.\nRaphael: Indeed we did. I discovered all there is to know about those scars of yours - it's a rather grim tale, even for my tastes.\nPlayer: Spill it - this sounds fascinating.\nAstarion: I'd appreciate a little less enthusiasm when it comes to Cazador and his horrors.\nRaphael: Oh come, Astarion. We're about to unveil your destiny - you should be quivering in anticipation.\nRaphael: As you know already, your precious skin is home to one part of a contract between the archdevil Mephistopheles, and your former master, Cazador Szarr.\nRaphael: In full, the contract states that Cazador will be granted knowledge of an infernal ritual so vile it has never been performed.\nRaphael: The Rite of Profane Ascension.\nRaphael: It promises to be a marvellous ceremony. Very elaborate, incredibly ancient, and entirely diabolical.\nRaphael: If he completes the rite, he will become a new kind of being - the Vampire Ascendant.\nRaphael: All the strengths of his vampiric form will be amplified, and alongside them he will enjoy the luxuries of the living.\nRaphael: The arousals and appetites of man will return to him, and unlike Astarion, he will have no need of a parasite to protect him from the sun.\nRaphael: But the ritual has its price, as all worthwhile things do. Lord Cazador will need to sacrifice a number of souls, including all of his vampiric spawn, if he is to ascend.\nRaphael: Imagine how he felt, then, when one of those precious spawn simply disappeared into thin air.\nRaphael: The only missing ingredient is Astarion.\nRaphael: You are the final piece he requires to complete the ritual - your scars bind you to it. Your soul will set off a very wave of death, bringing Cazador his twisted life.\nRaphael: And that, my tragic and toothsome friend, is that. Now if you'll excuse me, I have business elsewhere.\nNodeContext: [Tarik] snaps fingers at the end of the line.\nAstarion: Hmm...\nPlayer: Cazador is a piece of shit. We're going to stop him.\nAstarion: Do you think it's so simple?\nAstarion: What do you think I should do?\nPlayer: You'll never be free while Cazador lives.\nAstarion: I hate how right you are.\nAstarion: I knew he wouldn't leave me alone even when I was just another wretched toy for him to play with.\nAstarion: But if I'm the key to this power he craves, he'll hunt me to the ends of Faerûn.\nAstarion: I need to take the fight to him.\nAstarion: And I need you to help me.\nPlayer: After we dealt with our tadpole problem, yes, I'll help you then.\nAstarion: Once we deal with the tadpole, I'll be back to my nocturnal self. When you're being hunted by vampires, the dark is the worst place to hide.\nAstarion: I need to deal with Cazador while I still have any kind of advantage over him.\nAstarion: If you won't risk taking him on for my sake, think of the innocent souls he'll sacrifice in this ritual.\nPlayer: We're done talking about this, Astarion.

The druids blame us 'outsiders' for drawing them here. Nobody's welcome anymore.\nZevlor: They've started a ritual to cut the grove off from the world outside.\nZevlor: We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: What brought you here?\nZevlor: We're refugees from Elturel - we took shelter here after gnolls attacked us on the road.\nZevlor: We were bound for Baldur's Gate, and it was too late to turn back. Elturel had no place for tieflings after the Descent.\nNarrator: *You remember it. Elturel and all its citizens were dragged into Avernus - then back out again.*\nPlayer: Let me guess: Your old neighbours called you 'devilkin' and acted like they never knew you.\nZevlor: How easily such a nasty word slips through the mouth of someone you thought you knew.\nZevlor: We thought we'd found sanctuary here, but the druids have determined to turn us out.\nZevlor: We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: What brought you here?\nZevlor: We're refugees from Elturel - we took shelter here after gnolls attacked us on the road.\nZevlor: We were bound for Baldur's Gate, and it was too late to turn back.

We can only hope the citizens of Baldur's Gate are more open-minded.\nZevlor: But we can't get there with those beasts blocking our path.\nZevlor: We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: This ritual - is there no way to convince the druids to stop it?\nZevlor: I've tried. Kagha - their new First Druid - won't even see me.\nZevlor: You, though... I know it's not your business, but she owes you for saving this place.\nZevlor: Perhaps you could persuade her. For more time to prepare, if nothing else.\nPlayer: I'll see what I can do.\nPlayer: I'll find her. And I'll speak to Kagha while I'm there.",

    "conversation": "Havkelaag: Tell me, what can the Society do for you?\nPlayer: I met an expeditioner claiming to work for you. She sought a githyanki egg.\nHavkelaag: Yes, dear Lady Esther. One of our most reliable contractors, though unfortunately this particular request was too much even for her.\nHavkelaag: I believe she quite lost her senses over the task. She came here insisting I purchase an owlbear egg from her, of all things.\nHavkelaag: I don't suppose you've stumbled across any githyanki eggs during your travels? The Society will compensate you for any we purchase, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nHavkelaag: Would you consider parting with it?

Don't you dare consider it.\nPlayer: What are you going to do with it?\nHavkelaag: Study it, of course. The githyanki have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months.\nHavkelaag: You yourself have no doubt experienced the prejudice of those who assume that, as beings of the Underdark, we are inherently evil.\nHavkelaag: The githyanki face similar prejudice, but I believe, if hatched in a less violent, more intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome its evil predispositions.\nHavkelaag: I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: What does this 'intellectually stimulating' upbringing look like?\nHavkelaag: In the literal sense, I will need to induce the egg to hatch via the application of certain currents to the creature inside.\nHavkelaag: Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach:\nHavkelaag: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue.\nHavkelaag: Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: So you're planning to torture a child for a year?\nHavkelaag: The child will be a better individual after my treatment than it ever would have been had it been raised in its natural environment.\nHavkelaag: Any suffering it endures will therefore be worth it, for the child, perhaps for the whole of civilised society.\nHavkelaag: My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: And what if your experiment fails?\nHavkelaag: If the child remains evil after the experiment is concluded, it will be destroyed. Such is the fate of all used specimens.\nHavkelaag: Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg? ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: A gith hatchling is not a lab rat!

Now I want what I'm owed - we had a deal.\nRaphael: Indeed we did. I discovered all there is to know about those scars of yours - it's a rather grim tale, even for my tastes.\nPlayer: We had a deal - the orthon for information.\nRaphael: Indeed we did.

This is his destiny.\nRaphael: As you know already, your precious skin is home to one part of a contract between the archdevil Mephistopheles, and your former master, Cazador Szarr.\nRaphael: In full, the contract states that Cazador will be granted knowledge of an infernal ritual so vile it has never been performed.\nRaphael: The Rite of Profane Ascension.\nRaphael: It promises to be a marvellous ceremony. Very elaborate, incredibly ancient, and entirely diabolical.\nRaphael: If he completes the rite, he will become a new kind of being - the Vampire Ascendant.\nRaphael: All the strengths of his vampiric form will be amplified, and alongside them he will enjoy the luxuries of the living.\nRaphael: The arousals and appetites of man will return to him, and unlike Astarion, he will have no need of a parasite to protect him from the sun.\nRaphael: But the ritual has its price, as all worthwhile things do. Lord Cazador will need to sacrifice a number of souls, including all of his vampiric spawn, if he is to ascend.\nRaphael: Imagine how he felt, then, when one of those precious spawn simply disappeared into thin air.\nRaphael: The only missing ingredient is Astarion.\nRaphael: You are the final piece he requires to complete the ritual - your scars bind you to it. Your soul will set off a very wave of death, bringing Cazador his twisted life.\nRaphael: And that, my tragic and toothsome friend, is that. Now if you'll excuse me, I have business elsewhere.\nNodeContext: [Tarik] snaps fingers at the end of the line.\nAstarion: Hmm...\nPlayer: 'Hmm'? That's all you have to say?\nAstarion: I was... contemplating. It's a lot to take in.\nAstarion: What do you think I should do?\nPlayer: We can't let Cazador complete that ritual. He could unleash terrible horrors.\nAstarion: The end of my life among them. Just when I was starting to enjoy it.\nAstarion: He'll never leave me alone. I didn't think he would when I was just one more wretched toy for him to play with.\nAstarion: But if I'm the key to this power he craves, he'll hunt me to the ends of Faerûn.\nAstarion: I need to take the fight to him.\nAstarion: And I need you to help me.\nPlayer: After we dealt with our tadpole problem, yes, I'll help you then.\nAstarion: Once we deal with the tadpole, I'll be back to my nocturnal self. When you're being hunted by vampires, the dark is the worst place to hide.\nAstarion: I need to deal with Cazador while I still have any kind of advantage over him.\nAstarion: If you won't risk taking him on for my sake, think of the innocent souls he'll sacrifice in this ritual.\nPlayer: The Absolute is a greater threat - we need to focus.",

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon’s voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar.\nMalus Thorm: See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy.\nMalus Thorm: Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace.\nMalus Thorm: Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver.\nMalus Thorm: Come. Step forward. I can see the love of Shar darken your eyes. Be welcome.\nPlayer: May Shar guide your blessing hands.\nMalus Thorm: And the rough vessels that are yours.\nMalus Thorm: Tell me, what is the guiding principle of the goddess?\nPlayer: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Precisely.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly.\nMalus Thorm: It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nAstarion: He's just like Cazador - utterly insane.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being?\nMalus Thorm: If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: You are well on your way. But one white orb disfigures you still. Let us finish the cure.\nMalus Thorm: We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: The goddess has greater plans for me than to submit to your scalpels.\n: True\nMalus Thorm: Another absence is your fate? But if you are not here to be cured, how will my sisters learn?\nMalus Thorm: Their incisions are, as yet, still streaked with imprecision - that much I must concede.\nMalus Thorm: How to steady their hands, I wonder.\nPlayer: Sparring is vital to progress. Have them practice on each other.\nPlayer: Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\n: True\nMalus Thorm: Yes... For are we not all in need of a cure?\nMalus Thorm: The scalpel does not discriminate. Let each and every one of you partake in its soothing journey.\nMalus Thorm: Absence, sisters. Acquaint yourselves.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) Screaming and slashing, the sisters brutally murder each other.\nMalus Thorm: It is a proud moment when one sees one's teachings so lovingly taken to heart.\nMalus Thorm: You are to be commended for their graduation - rewarded with the promised cure.\nMalus Thorm: Come, I will acquaint you with the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nPlayer: I would rather acquaint myself - if you show me how.\n: True\nMalus Thorm: Your diligence is exemplary.

Tyr has abandoned us; Helm's eye has strayed.\nNarrator: *Tyr's fury glows within you. Despite Ravengard's words, the Lord of Justice has remained loyal to you, as you have to him.*\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: But Baldur's Gate will soon burn bright.

Regretting it yet?\nWulbren Bongle: I spent a lot of time thinking of worst case scenarios while I was locked in that cell you plucked me out of at Moonrise.\nWulbren Bongle: I didn't imagine anything as bad as this. The Gondians have handed Enver Gortash the means to bring about the end of liberty in Baldur's Gate.\nWulbren Bongle: And the citizens have rolled out the red carpet for their new tyrant.\nWulbren Bongle: Resistance fighters are few and far between - my Ironhands, what's left of the Harpers, and you. I hope.\nPlayer: I'm with you.\nWulbren Bongle: Good. We don't have a chance unless we stick together - not while the Gondians' metal monsters are patrolling the streets.\nWulbren Bongle: The Steel Watch. They're a threat to you, me - and every man, woman and child in the city.\nWulbren Bongle: They act all civilised... servants of the people. But they only serve one man.\nWulbren Bongle: When he becomes Grand Duke, it will only get worse. Laws will change, freedoms will vanish, and soon you'll be accused and sentenced before you've even committed a crime.\nWulbren Bongle: And the fucking Gondians are to blame for all of it.\nPlayer: The Gondians are just inventors. You can't blame them for Gortash's actions.\nWulbren Bongle: I can blame them for precisely that reason.\nPlayer: There must be a reason the Gondians would do something so terrible.\nWulbren Bongle: Could be they're part of the cult. Could just be for coin. Couldn't possibly tell you.\nWulbren Bongle: They've always been happy to provide their technology to despots in exchange for a stipend and the freedom to work in peace.\nWulbren Bongle: They would have licked Sarevok's boots given the chance, and now they'll kiss Gortash's ring while the city screams.\nWulbren Bongle: I had a plan to put a stop to them. But the way things are now, if we stick our heads above ground, the Watchers are on us like flies on shit.\nPlayer: I've already run foul of the Watchers myself.\nWulbren Bongle: And yet here you are, all in one piece. Most people who cross them aren't much more than a stain on the street afterwards.\nWulbren Bongle: You can do what's needed - I'm sure of it.\nWulbren Bongle: You just need a little assistance, and I can provide it.\nWulbren Bongle: The Gondians are ingenious. But we're more than equal to them - there's nothing they can build that the Ironhands can't tear down.\nWulbren Bongle: I've built something unique for just that purpose.\nWulbren Bongle: A runepowder bomb - first of its kind. Fifty wizards high on the Weave couldn't summon this kind of firepower.\nWulbren Bongle: Get the bomb inside the Gondian facility, and - boom. Problem solved.\nBarcus Wroot: Wulbren, please. This is too far! Everyone in the foundry would be killed.\nWulbren Bongle: Quiet, Barcus. The adults are talking.\nPlayer: I'll blow up the foundry - give me the bomb.",

The Society's coffers are deep enough to cover any expenses accrued in its retrieval, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: Chk. Don't you dare consider it.\nPlayer: What are you going to do with it?\nHavkelaag: Study it, of course. Your kind have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months.\nHavkelaag: Most on this plane believe you to be innately cruel, violent beings. Evil, if you will.\nHavkelaag: As citizens of the Underdark, we face similar stigmas. Totally unfounded, of course - our natures are as unfixed as any who walk the surface.\nHavkelaag: I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: What does this 'intellectually stimulating' upbringing look like?\nHavkelaag: In the literal sense, I will need to induce the egg to hatch via the application of certain currents to the creature inside.\nHavkelaag: Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach:\nHavkelaag: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue.\nHavkelaag: Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: Why follow the dogma of a draconic god?\nHavkelaag: In my years of study, they're the closest I've found to moral perfection. Only under such rigorous 'goodness' will the subject stand a chance of being cured.\nHavkelaag: My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: Your findings are irrelevant, as are the opinions of all on this kaincha plane.\nHavkelaag: Ah. A display of the well-known githyanki arrogance. I am not sure my experiment can cure that particular affliction, but give me time and I will find a way.\nHavkelaag: Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg? ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: A gith hatchling is not a lab rat! This shka'keth should be bled dry for the mere suggestion.\nPlayer: Sell the egg.\nHavkelaag: Ah. Unfortunately, it seems I've mislaid my purse.\nHavkelaag: I don't suppose you'd consider simply donating it to the Society instead?\nPlayer: Fine. Here you go.",

We can make much more coin than you would with your employers.\n: True\nRugan: I like the way you think. Didn't expect to turn this horrorshow to my advantage... but why not?\nRugan: The chest's all yours.

Nobody will be the wiser.\nRugan: Don't try to cut me out of the deal though. The Black Network has eyes and blades everywhere.\nRugan: Crafty swine like you could make a name for yourself in the Zhentarim. Make sure to drop by our hideout.\nRugan: Pass phrase at the door is 'little serpent, long shadow'. I'll tell my associates to expect you.\nPlayer: I already met your friends - we didn't get along too well.\nRugan: And yet here you are. There's not many cause trouble in a Zhent hideout and walk away.\nRugan: I'd rather walk away too. So let's say our goodbyes, and speak no more of it.\nPlayer: You can leave - but your cargo stays.",

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon’s voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar.\nMalus Thorm: See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy.\nMalus Thorm: Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace.\nMalus Thorm: Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver.\nMalus Thorm: Come. Step forward. You are no sister, but that matters none. Every student is welcome.\nPlayer: A student, yes. Do please enlighten me.\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly.\nMalus Thorm: It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nWyll: Hells. Only a monster would inflict misery and call it medicine.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being?\nMalus Thorm: If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: But you: look how the succour of Shar eludes you.

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon’s voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar.\nMalus Thorm: See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy.\nMalus Thorm: Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision.

We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace.\nMalus Thorm: Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver.\nMalus Thorm: Come. Step forward.

Entertaining, if not efficient.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being?\nMalus Thorm: If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: You are well on your way. But one white orb disfigures you still. Let us finish the cure.\nMalus Thorm: We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: The goddess has greater plans for me than to submit to your scalpels.\n: True\nMalus Thorm: Another absence is your fate?

They should spar each other.\nPlayer: Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\n: True\nMalus Thorm: Yes... For are we not all in need of a cure?\nMalus Thorm: The scalpel does not discriminate. Let each and every one of you partake in its soothing journey.\nMalus Thorm: Absence, sisters.

    "conversation": "Havkelaag: Well met. What can the Society of Brilliance do for you?\nHavkelaag: Tell me, what can the Society do for you?\nPlayer: I carry an unhatched githyanki egg. Would you be interested in studying it?\nHavkelaag: A githyanki egg? What a fortuitous turn of events. I've been attempting to get my hands on one for some time now.\nHavkelaag: Would you consider parting with it? The Society's coffers are deep enough to cover any expenses accrued in its retrieval, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: Chk. Don't you dare consider it.\nPlayer: What are you going to do with it?\nHavkelaag: Study it, of course. The githyanki have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months.\nHavkelaag: You are no doubt aware that citizens of the Underdark are held in great suspicion by those who live above ground. Many believe us to be 'evil'.\nHavkelaag: The githyanki face similar prejudice, but I believe, if hatched in a less violent, more intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome its evil predispositions.\nHavkelaag: I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: So the child inside will be experimented on?\nHavkelaag: Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach:\nHavkelaag: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue.\nHavkelaag: Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: This experiment is exactly the kind of evil you're trying to disprove.\nHavkelaag: The pursuit of knowledge is neither evil nor good. Only in the application of such knowledge should one take on any moral imperative.\nHavkelaag: My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: An experiment like this will only confirm the surface dwellers' suspicion of us.\nHavkelaag: Of course it won't. If anything, it will do quite the opposite. The academic institutions up here will finally be forced to take us seriously.\nHavkelaag: Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg? ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: A gith hatchling is not a lab rat! This shka'keth should be bled dry for the mere suggestion.\nPlayer: Sell the egg.\nHavkelaag: Ah. Unfortunately, it seems I've mislaid my purse.\nHavkelaag: I don't suppose you'd consider simply donating it to the Society instead?\nPlayer: Fine. Here you go.",

She sought a githyanki egg.\nHavkelaag: Yes, dear Lady Esther. One of our most reliable contractors, though unfortunately this particular request was too much even for her.\nHavkelaag: I believe she quite lost her senses over the task.

Don't you dare consider it.\nPlayer: What are you going to do with it?\nHavkelaag: Study it, of course. The githyanki have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months.\nHavkelaag: You are no doubt aware that citizens of the Underdark are held in great suspicion by those who live above ground. Many believe us to be 'evil'.\nHavkelaag: The githyanki face similar prejudice, but I believe, if hatched in a less violent, more intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome its evil predispositions.\nHavkelaag: I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: You assume my people are evil, yet your research is built on sheer superstition.\nHavkelaag: Enough of your kind have wreaked destruction on this plane for me to be confident in my assertion.\nHavkelaag: When I have a suitable sample for my study, I will, however, prove that the effects of their biological inclination are reversible.\nHavkelaag: Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach:\nHavkelaag: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue.\nHavkelaag: Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: That kind of indoctrination and time-forced nurture violates the natural order. It invalidates the whole experiment.\nHavkelaag: I won't bother to argue with you. An arboreal shaman can't be expected to understand the rigorous protocols of theoretical research.\nHavkelaag: My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: An experiment like this will only confirm the surface dwellers' suspicion of us.\nHavkelaag: Of course it won't. If anything, it will do quite the opposite. The academic institutions up here will finally be forced to take us seriously.\nHavkelaag: Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg?

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon’s voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar.\nMalus Thorm: See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy.\nMalus Thorm: Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace.\nMalus Thorm: Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver.\nMalus Thorm: Come. Step forward. You are no sister, but that matters none. Every student is welcome.\nPlayer: I am a scholar, this is true - just not in the study of torture.\nMalus Thorm: Behold, sisters, the very face of ignorance - one who mistakes tenderness for torture.\nMalus Thorm: Go on. Acquaint the face of ignorance with the true object of our studies.\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly.\nMalus Thorm: It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nKarlach: What the fuck is this loon talking about.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being?\nMalus Thorm: If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: But you: look how the succour of Shar eludes even you, one who walks faithfully in her shadow. See how painfully present you remain...\nMalus Thorm: We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: The sisters aren't ready. They'll make me sick instead of curing me.\n: True\nMalus Thorm: Their incisions are, as yet, still streaked with imprecision - that much I must concede.\nMalus Thorm: How to steady their hands, I wonder.\nPlayer: I take joy in performing with a master of my craft - I'm sure the sisters are the same. Why don't you volunteer?\nPlayer: In my years of study, I have found no better teacher than example. Perhaps you could volunteer?\n: True\nMalus Thorm: I see now.

We can make much more coin than you would with your employers.\n: False\nRugan: Coin ain't any use to the dead.

The githyanki have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months.\nHavkelaag: You yourself have no doubt experienced the prejudice of those who assume that, as beings of the Underdark, we are inherently evil.\nHavkelaag: The githyanki face similar prejudice, but I believe, if hatched in a less violent, more intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome its evil predispositions.\nHavkelaag: I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: You're letting your personal biases affect your method. Why assume they're evil?\nHavkelaag: I assume nothing. Innate githyanki cruelty is an established fact - no doubt you witnessed it yourself in the retrieval of the egg itself.\nHavkelaag: When I have a suitable sample for my study, I will, however, prove that the effects of their biological inclination are reversible.\nHavkelaag: Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach:\nHavkelaag: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue.\nHavkelaag: Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: What's the Ptarian code?\nHavkelaag: A series of moral imperatives bestowed by the great dragon-deity Bahamut.\nHavkelaag: In my years of study, they're the closest I've found to moral perfection.

She sought a githyanki egg.\nHavkelaag: Yes, dear Lady Esther. One of our most reliable contractors, though unfortunately this particular request was too much even for her.\nHavkelaag: I believe she quite lost her senses over the task. She came here insisting I purchase an owlbear egg from her, of all things.\nHavkelaag: I don't suppose you've stumbled across any githyanki eggs during your travels? The Society will compensate you for any we purchase, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nHavkelaag: Would you consider parting with it?

Don't you dare consider it.\nPlayer: What are you going to do with it?\nHavkelaag: Study it, of course. The githyanki have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months.\nHavkelaag: You are no doubt aware that citizens of the Underdark are held in great suspicion by those who live above ground. Many believe us to be 'evil'.\nHavkelaag: The githyanki face similar prejudice, but I believe, if hatched in a less violent, more intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome its evil predispositions.\nHavkelaag: I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: You're letting your personal biases affect your method. Why assume they're evil?\nHavkelaag: I assume nothing. Innate githyanki cruelty is an established fact - no doubt you witnessed it yourself in the retrieval of the egg itself.\nHavkelaag: When I have a suitable sample for my study, I will, however, prove that the effects of their biological inclination are reversible.\nHavkelaag: Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach:\nHavkelaag: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue.\nHavkelaag: Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: You would teach the child virtue, but rear it without patience. Curious.\nHavkelaag: Tell me, then, philosopher - if patience delays the fostering of the other virtues, can it be rightly called virtuous?\nPlayer: Patience does not delay, it simply tempers virtue. Curtails it from excess.\nHavkelaag: A cautious, hesitant instinct. One I am afraid we do not have time for.\nHavkelaag: My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: And what if your experiment fails?\nHavkelaag: If the child remains evil after the experiment is concluded, it will be destroyed. Such is the fate of all used specimens.\nHavkelaag: Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg? ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: A gith hatchling is not a lab rat! This shka'keth should be bled dry for the mere suggestion.\nPlayer: Sell the egg.\nHavkelaag: Ah. Unfortunately, it seems I've mislaid my purse.\nHavkelaag: I don't suppose you'd consider simply donating it to the Society instead?\nPlayer: Fine. Here you go.",

Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy.\nMalus Thorm: Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself.

Only a monster would inflict misery and call it medicine.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being?\nMalus Thorm: If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: But you: look how the succour of Shar eludes you.

One of our most reliable contractors, though unfortunately this particular request was too much even for her.\nHavkelaag: I believe she quite lost her senses over the task. She came here insisting I purchase an owlbear egg from her, of all things.\nHavkelaag: I don't suppose you've stumbled across any githyanki eggs during your travels? The Society will compensate you for any we purchase, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nHavkelaag: Would you consider parting with it?

Don't you dare consider it.\nPlayer: What are you going to do with it?\nHavkelaag: Study it, of course. Your kind have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months.\nHavkelaag: Most on this plane believe you to be innately cruel, violent beings. Evil, if you will.\nHavkelaag: As citizens of the Underdark, we face similar stigmas. Totally unfounded, of course - our natures are as unfixed as any who walk the surface.\nHavkelaag: I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: What does this 'intellectually stimulating' upbringing look like?\nHavkelaag: In the literal sense, I will need to induce the egg to hatch via the application of certain currents to the creature inside.\nHavkelaag: Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach:\nHavkelaag: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue.\nHavkelaag: Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: You would teach the child virtue, but rear it without patience. Curious.\nHavkelaag: Tell me, then, philosopher - if patience delays the fostering of the other virtues, can it be rightly called virtuous?\nPlayer: Patience does not delay, it simply tempers virtue. Curtails it from excess.\nHavkelaag: A cautious, hesitant instinct. One I am afraid we do not have time for.\nHavkelaag: My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: No benefit could justify you inflicting such cruelty.\nHavkelaag: Rigorous experimental methods demand we do not indulge our own emotional responses in the application of discomfort to our subjects.\nHavkelaag: Only by the full, uninhibited application of psionic stimuli will we have a true measure of whether the child's innate evil has been cured.\nHavkelaag: Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg? ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: A gith hatchling is not a lab rat! This shka'keth should be bled dry for the mere suggestion.\nPlayer: Sell the egg.\nHavkelaag: Ah. Unfortunately, it seems I've mislaid my purse.\nHavkelaag: I don't suppose you'd consider simply donating it to the Society instead?\nPlayer: Fine. Here you go.",

Given that all of these True Souls are infected, it has to be the source of this magic.\nHalsin: If you want to find a cure, you must head there and discover how the tadpoles are being manipulated.\nPlayer: You seem to know a lot about this.

The natural order must be protected.\nPlayer: Kagha is dead. She was swayed by Shadow Druids. I had no choice.\nHalsin: Kagha... This is my fault - I was her teacher. I will mourn her when I can.\nHalsin: But there are other matters to attend to before that.\nHalsin: Chaos is welcome, in doses; it helps keep balance. But this is too much - this is unnatural.\nHalsin: It's too late to merely kill this horde's leadership - their forces are already marching. If you want me to help, you need to help me first.\nHalsin: You must get ahead of them, muster the defences.\nPlayer: The grove isn't my problem. I have to concentrate on saving myself.",

    "conversation": "Raphael: Do you know what happens when a devil is struck down on this charming plane of existence?\nRaphael: It returns to the hells - to the very point where it last stood before venturing to whichever devilforsaken plane it died on.\nRaphael: In the case of our friend Yurgir, the orthon you so handily dispatched in the temple of Shar, he manifested in my House of Hope.\nRaphael: He returned to me chastened but intact, his wounds healed, his body restored.\nRaphael: He thought I would dismember him but he has his uses so instead I am reeducating him.\nAstarion: We delivered the devil. Now I want what I'm owed - we had a deal.\nRaphael: Indeed we did. I discovered all there is to know about those scars of yours - it's a rather grim tale, even for my tastes.\nPlayer: Please, give me more boring details about your plans.\nRaphael: Come now, we're about to unveil your destiny - you should be quivering in anticipation.\n\nRaphael: And why would he want to walk away? This is his destiny.\nRaphael: As you know already, your precious skin is home to one part of a contract between the archdevil Mephistopheles, and your former master, Cazador Szarr.\nRaphael: In full, the contract states that Cazador will be granted knowledge of an infernal ritual so vile it has never been performed.\nRaphael: The Rite of Profane Ascension.\nRaphael: It promises to be a marvellous ceremony. Very elaborate, incredibly ancient, and entirely diabolical.\nRaphael: If he completes the rite, he will become a new kind of being - the Vampire Ascendant.\nRaphael: All the strengths of his vampiric form will be amplified, and alongside them he will enjoy the luxuries of the living.\nRaphael: The arousals and appetites of man will return to him, and unlike Astarion, he will have no need of a parasite to protect him from the sun.\nRaphael: But the ritual has its price, as all worthwhile things do. Lord Cazador will need to sacrifice a number of souls, including all of his vampiric spawn, if he is to ascend.\nRaphael: Imagine how he felt, then, when one of those precious spawn simply disappeared into thin air.\nRaphael: The only missing ingredient is Astarion.\nRaphael: You are the final piece he requires to complete the ritual - your scars bind you to it. Your soul will set off a very wave of death, bringing Cazador his twisted life.\nRaphael: And that, my tragic and toothsome friend, is that. Now if you'll excuse me, I have business elsewhere.\nNodeContext: [Tarik] snaps fingers at the end of the line.\nAstarion: Hmm...\nPlayer: You're... quiet. It's unsettling.\nAstarion: It's a lot to take in.\nAstarion: What do you think I should do?\nPlayer: There's a way to become a living vampire... That must mean a lot to you.\nAstarion: The idea definitely has appeal.\nAstarion: I could get rid of the worm in my head and still walk in the sun. I'd finally be free of the hunger.\nAstarion: And if I'm the key to this deal of Cazador's, perhaps I can turn this to my advantage...\nAstarion: I need to take the fight to him.\nAstarion: And I need you to help me.\nPlayer: If he comes for you, I'll defend you. But we're not risking an attack on his lair.\nAstarion: If you won't risk taking him on for my sake, think of the innocent souls he'll sacrifice in this ritual.\nPlayer: You're right - I'll help you destroy him.",

    "conversation": "Raphael: Do you know what happens when a devil is struck down on this charming plane of existence?\nRaphael: It returns to the hells - to the very point where it last stood before venturing to whichever devilforsaken plane it died on.\nRaphael: In the case of our friend Yurgir, the orthon you so handily dispatched in the temple of Shar, he manifested in my House of Hope.\nRaphael: He returned to me chastened but intact, his wounds healed, his body restored.\nRaphael: He thought I would dismember him but he has his uses so instead I am reeducating him.\nAstarion: We delivered the devil. Now I want what I'm owed - we had a deal.\nRaphael: Indeed we did. I discovered all there is to know about those scars of yours - it's a rather grim tale, even for my tastes.\nPlayer: Spill it - this sounds fascinating.\nAstarion: I'd appreciate a little less enthusiasm when it comes to Cazador and his horrors.\nRaphael: Oh come, Astarion. We're about to unveil your destiny - you should be quivering in anticipation.\nRaphael: Carved into that ivory skin of yours is one part of an infernal contract between the archdevil Mephistopheles and your former master, Cazador Szarr.\nRaphael: In full, the contract states that Cazador will be granted knowledge of an infernal ritual so vile it has never been performed.\nRaphael: The Rite of Profane Ascension.\nRaphael: It promises to be a marvellous ceremony. Very elaborate, incredibly ancient, and entirely diabolical.\nRaphael: If he completes the rite, he will become a new kind of being - the Vampire Ascendant.\nRaphael: All the strengths of his vampiric form will be amplified, and alongside them he will enjoy the luxuries of the living.\nRaphael: The arousals and appetites of man will return to him, and unlike Astarion, he will have no need of a parasite to protect him from the sun.\nRaphael: But the ritual has its price, as all worthwhile things do. Lord Cazador will need to sacrifice a number of souls, including all of his vampiric spawn, if he is to ascend.\nRaphael: Imagine how he felt, then, when one of those precious spawn simply disappeared into thin air.\nRaphael: The only missing ingredient is Astarion.\nRaphael: You are the final piece he requires to complete the ritual - your scars bind you to it. Your soul will set off a very wave of death, bringing Cazador his twisted life.\nRaphael: And that, my tragic and toothsome friend, is that. Now if you'll excuse me, I have business elsewhere.\nNodeContext: [Tarik] snaps fingers at the end of the line.\nAstarion: Hmm...\nPlayer: Cazador is a piece of shit. We're going to stop him.\nAstarion: Do you think it's so simple?\nAstarion: What do you think I should do?\nPlayer: We can't let Cazador complete that ritual. He could unleash terrible horrors.\nAstarion: The end of my life among them. Just when I was starting to enjoy it.\nAstarion: He'll never leave me alone. I didn't think he would when I was just one more wretched toy for him to play with.\nAstarion: But if I'm the key to this power he craves, he'll hunt me to the ends of Faerûn.\nAstarion: I need to take the fight to him.\nAstarion: And I need you to help me.\nPlayer: After we dealt with our tadpole problem, yes, I'll help you then.\nAstarion: Once we deal with the tadpole, I'll be back to my nocturnal self. When you're being hunted by vampires, the dark is the worst place to hide.\nAstarion: I need to deal with Cazador while I still have any kind of advantage over him.\nAstarion: If you won't risk taking him on for my sake, think of the innocent souls he'll sacrifice in this ritual.\nPlayer: You're right - I'll help you destroy him.",

We're about to unveil your destiny - you should be quivering in anticipation.\nRaphael: As you know already, your precious skin is home to one part of a contract between the archdevil Mephistopheles, and your former master, Cazador Szarr.\nRaphael: In full, the contract states that Cazador will be granted knowledge of an infernal ritual so vile it has never been performed.\nRaphael: The Rite of Profane Ascension.\nRaphael: It promises to be a marvellous ceremony. Very elaborate, incredibly ancient, and entirely diabolical.\nRaphael: If he completes the rite, he will become a new kind of being - the Vampire Ascendant.\nRaphael: All the strengths of his vampiric form will be amplified, and alongside them he will enjoy the luxuries of the living.\nRaphael: The arousals and appetites of man will return to him, and unlike Astarion, he will have no need of a parasite to protect him from the sun.\nRaphael: But the ritual has its price, as all worthwhile things do. Lord Cazador will need to sacrifice a number of souls, including all of his vampiric spawn, if he is to ascend.\nRaphael: Imagine how he felt, then, when one of those precious spawn simply disappeared into thin air.\nRaphael: The only missing ingredient is Astarion.\nRaphael: You are the final piece he requires to complete the ritual - your scars bind you to it.

If Cazador can't find you, he can't complete his ritual.\n\nAstarion: How long do you think I can run? He has eternity to find me.\nAstarion: He'll never leave me alone.

Now I want what I'm owed - we had a deal.\nRaphael: Indeed we did. I discovered all there is to know about those scars of yours - it's a rather grim tale, even for my tastes.\nPlayer: We had a deal - the orthon for information.\nRaphael: Indeed we did. I discovered all there is to know about those scars of yours - it's a rather grim tale, even for my tastes.\nPlayer: Spill it - this sounds fascinating.\nAstarion: I'd appreciate a little less enthusiasm when it comes to Cazador and his horrors.\nRaphael: Oh come, Astarion. We're about to unveil your destiny - you should be quivering in anticipation.\nRaphael: As you know already, your precious skin is home to one part of a contract between the archdevil Mephistopheles, and your former master, Cazador Szarr.\nRaphael: In full, the contract states that Cazador will be granted knowledge of an infernal ritual so vile it has never been performed.\nRaphael: The Rite of Profane Ascension.\nRaphael: It promises to be a marvellous ceremony. Very elaborate, incredibly ancient, and entirely diabolical.\nRaphael: If he completes the rite, he will become a new kind of being - the Vampire Ascendant.\nRaphael: All the strengths of his vampiric form will be amplified, and alongside them he will enjoy the luxuries of the living.\nRaphael: The arousals and appetites of man will return to him, and unlike you, he will have no need of a parasite to protect him from the sun.\nRaphael: But the ritual has its price, as all worthwhile things do. Lord Cazador will need to sacrifice a number of souls, including all of his vampiric spawn, if he is to ascend.\nRaphael: Imagine how he felt, then, when one of those precious spawn simply disappeared into thin air.\nRaphael: The only missing ingredient is Astarion.\nRaphael: You are the final piece he requires to complete the ritual - your scars bind you to it. Your soul will set off a very wave of death, bringing Cazador his twisted life.\nRaphael: And that, my tragic and toothsome friend, is that. Now if you'll excuse me, I have business elsewhere.\nNodeContext: [Tarik] snaps fingers at the end of the line.\nAstarion: Hmm...\nPlayer: Cazador is a piece of shit. We're going to stop him.\nAstarion: Do you think it's so simple?\nAstarion: What do you think I should do?\nPlayer: You'll never be free while Cazador lives.\nAstarion: I hate how right you are.\nAstarion: I knew he wouldn't leave me alone even when I was just another wretched toy for him to play with.\nAstarion: But if I'm the key to this power he craves, he'll hunt me to the ends of Faerûn.\nAstarion: I need to take the fight to him.\nAstarion: And I need you to help me.\nPlayer: If he comes for you, I'll defend you. But we're not risking an attack on his lair.\nAstarion: If you won't risk taking him on for my sake, think of the innocent souls he'll sacrifice in this ritual.\nPlayer: You're right - I'll help you destroy him.",

To dance on the edge between life and death? Yes, I want it.\nAraj Oblodra: I'll even compensate you - a potion of legendary power that forever increases the strength of the one who consumes it.\nAraj Oblodra: It's not for sale, but it's yours if you bite me.\nAstarion: I will have to decline.\nAraj Oblodra: Excuse me?

Now I want what I'm owed - we had a deal.\nRaphael: Indeed we did. I discovered all there is to know about those scars of yours - it's a rather grim tale, even for my tastes.\nPlayer: We had a deal - the orthon for information.\nRaphael: Indeed we did.

We're about to unveil your destiny - you should be quivering in anticipation.\nRaphael: As you know already, your precious skin is home to one part of a contract between the archdevil Mephistopheles, and your former master, Cazador Szarr.\nRaphael: In full, the contract states that Cazador will be granted knowledge of an infernal ritual so vile it has never been performed.\nRaphael: The Rite of Profane Ascension.\nRaphael: It promises to be a marvellous ceremony. Very elaborate, incredibly ancient, and entirely diabolical.\nRaphael: If he completes the rite, he will become a new kind of being - the Vampire Ascendant.\nRaphael: All the strengths of his vampiric form will be amplified, and alongside them he will enjoy the luxuries of the living.\nRaphael: The arousals and appetites of man will return to him, and unlike Astarion, he will have no need of a parasite to protect him from the sun.\nRaphael: But the ritual has its price, as all worthwhile things do. Lord Cazador will need to sacrifice a number of souls, including all of his vampiric spawn, if he is to ascend.\nRaphael: Imagine how he felt, then, when one of those precious spawn simply disappeared into thin air.\nRaphael: The only missing ingredient is Astarion.\nRaphael: You are the final piece he requires to complete the ritual - your scars bind you to it. Your soul will set off a very wave of death, bringing Cazador his twisted life.\nRaphael: And that, my tragic and toothsome friend, is that. Now if you'll excuse me, I have business elsewhere.\nNodeContext: [Tarik] snaps fingers at the end of the line.\nAstarion: Hmm...\nPlayer: 'Hmm'? That's all you have to say?\nAstarion: I was... contemplating. It's a lot to take in.\nAstarion: What do you think I should do?\nPlayer: We can't let Cazador complete that ritual. He could unleash terrible horrors.\nAstarion: The end of my life among them. Just when I was starting to enjoy it.\nAstarion: He'll never leave me alone. I didn't think he would when I was just one more wretched toy for him to play with.\nAstarion: But if I'm the key to this power he craves, he'll hunt me to the ends of Faerûn.\nAstarion: I need to take the fight to him.\nAstarion: And I need you to help me.\nPlayer: If he comes for you, I'll defend you. But we're not risking an attack on his lair.\nAstarion: If you won't risk taking him on for my sake, think of the innocent souls he'll sacrifice in this ritual.\nPlayer: You're right - I'll help you destroy him.",

Now I want what I'm owed - we had a deal.\nRaphael: Indeed we did.

We're about to unveil your destiny - you should be quivering in anticipation.\nRaphael: Carved into that ivory skin of yours is one part of an infernal contract between the archdevil Mephistopheles and your former master, Cazador Szarr.\nRaphael: In full, the contract states that Cazador will be granted knowledge of an infernal ritual so vile it has never been performed.\nRaphael: The Rite of Profane Ascension.\nRaphael: It promises to be a marvellous ceremony. Very elaborate, incredibly ancient, and entirely diabolical.\nRaphael: If he completes the rite, he will become a new kind of being - the Vampire Ascendant.\nRaphael: All the strengths of his vampiric form will be amplified, and alongside them he will enjoy the luxuries of the living.\nRaphael: The arousals and appetites of man will return to him, and unlike you, he will have no need of a parasite to protect him from the sun.\nRaphael: But the ritual has its price, as all worthwhile things do. Lord Cazador will need to sacrifice a number of souls, including all of his vampiric spawn, if he is to ascend.\nRaphael: Imagine how he felt, then, when one of those precious spawn simply disappeared into thin air.\nRaphael: The only missing ingredient is Astarion.\nRaphael: You are the final piece he requires to complete the ritual - your scars bind you to it. Your soul will set off a very wave of death, bringing Cazador his twisted life.\nRaphael: And that, my tragic and toothsome friend, is that. Now if you'll excuse me, I have business elsewhere.\nNodeContext: [Tarik] snaps fingers at the end of the line.\nAstarion: Hmm...\nPlayer: You're... quiet. It's unsettling.\nAstarion: It's a lot to take in.\nAstarion: What do you think I should do?\nPlayer: I think you should run. If Cazador can't find you, he can't complete his ritual.\n\nAstarion: How long do you think I can run? He has eternity to find me.\nAstarion: He'll never leave me alone. I didn't think he would when I was just one more wretched toy for him to play with.\nAstarion: But if I'm the key to this power he craves, he'll hunt me to the ends of Faerûn.\nAstarion: I need to take the fight to him.\nAstarion: And I need you to help me.\nPlayer: If he comes for you, I'll defend you. But we're not risking an attack on his lair.\nAstarion: If you won't risk taking him on for my sake, think of the innocent souls he'll sacrifice in this ritual.\nPlayer: You're right - I'll help you destroy him.",

I won't bite.\nAraj Oblodra: Oh I'd prefer if you did.\nAraj Oblodra: I assume he belongs to you?\nPlayer: We travel together - that's all.\nAraj Oblodra: Ah, it's like that.\nAraj Oblodra: Do you have a name, spawn?\nAstarion: Astarion, but hold on-\nAraj Oblodra: Good. Now, Astarion, I've dreamt of being bitten by a vampire since I was a young girl.\nAstarion: I'm sorry? You want to be bitten?\nAraj Oblodra: To feel your life's blood slipping away? To dance on the edge between life and death? Yes, I want it.\nAraj Oblodra: I'll even compensate you - a potion of legendary power that forever increases the strength of the one who consumes it.\nAraj Oblodra: It's not for sale, but it's yours if you bite me.\nAstarion: I will have to decline.\nAraj Oblodra: Excuse me? This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and you're squandering it.\nAstarion: I gave you my answer.\nAraj Oblodra: Can't you talk some sense into your obstinate charge?\nPlayer: Just bite her - the potion sounds useful.\nAstarion: I'm sorry, but could you excuse us a moment?\nAstarion: Are you actually asking me to do this? Trading me for some potion?\nAstarion: Because there's something wrong with her blood. I can smell it from here - it's rank.\nPlayer: Her house, Oblodra, was infamous for experimenting with mind flayers. Could her blood be tainted somehow?\nAstarion: That would explain the stench, yes.\nAstarion: I already have enough illithid filth in my head - I don't want it in my stomach as well.\nAraj Oblodra: I don't have all day, True Soul.\nPlayer: Don't do anything you don't want to.\nAstarion: All right.

I worshipped that woman.\nPlayer: So it's personal? Good - let's take her down.\nNightwarden Minthara: You make it sound so simple. She is the Chosen of Bhaal, Lord of Murder, and one of the cult's founders.\nNightwarden Minthara: Indeed, she is the one who indoctrinated me with the Absolute's lies.\nPlayer: What can you tell me about Orin?\nNightwarden Minthara: She is fierce, vicious, and cruel. In those respects, we are alike - but she is dangerously unpredictable.\nNightwarden Minthara: If there is a way to turn this design toward slaughter rather than control, she will take it.\nNightwarden Minthara: She is the one who brought me to Moonrise, and into the presence of her so-called god - the Absolute.\nNightwarden Minthara: Now I know that those memories are lies.\nNightwarden Minthara: There was no god. Orin held me down in a cocoon of flesh, while a mind flayer forced a parasite into my brain. And she laughed at my fear.\nNightwarden Minthara: I will find her, I will murder her. And I will smile.\nPlayer: Is vengeance the limit of your ambitions?\nNightwarden Minthara: There is no limit to my ambitions. I will enjoy killing Orin, but unlike her, I do not kill for pleasure alone. I kill to gain advantage.\nNightwarden Minthara: And we have the chance to seize the greatest advantage of all. Surely you see it?\nNightwarden Minthara: In killing Ketheric, we fractured the cult's leadership. When we break the other Chosen and claim their Netherstones, we can take control.\nPlayer: A bold gamble. How can you be sure it's possible?\nNightwarden Minthara: I would have thought this entire conspiracy of gods and monsters to be impossible if I had not seen it for myself.\nNightwarden Minthara: We may fail, but we must try.\nNightwarden Minthara: The power of the enslaved elder brain could reshape the world.

I worshipped that woman.\nPlayer: When I murder her, Bhaal will choose me in her place.\nNightwarden Minthara: I would prefer to put my faith in your strength than the favour of your god. After all, it is Orin and this grand deception that he chose - not you.\nNightwarden Minthara: He favours her, and she is one of the founders of this insane cult.\nNightwarden Minthara: Indeed, she is the one who indoctrinated me with the Absolute's lies.\nPlayer: What do you remember of your indoctrination?\nNightwarden Minthara: When I first visited Moonrise, I stood before the Absolute in awe.\nNightwarden Minthara: It was more of an idea than an entity. Pure love. Total power.\nNightwarden Minthara: Orin was by my side. She told me that god had chosen me to be a True Soul. Blessed and adored.\nNightwarden Minthara: Now I know that those memories are lies.\nNightwarden Minthara: There was no god. Orin held me down in a cocoon of flesh, while a mind flayer forced a parasite into my brain. And she laughed at my fear.\nNightwarden Minthara: I will find her, I will murder her. And I will smile.\nPlayer: Once she's dead, the cult will need new leadership - perhaps we can take her place.",

Pure love. Total power.\nNightwarden Minthara: Orin was by my side. She told me that god had chosen me to be a True Soul. Blessed and adored.\nNightwarden Minthara: Now I know that those memories are lies.\nNightwarden Minthara: There was no god. Orin held me down in a cocoon of flesh, while a mind flayer forced a parasite into my brain. And she laughed at my fear.\nNightwarden Minthara: I will find her, I will murder her. And I will smile.\nPlayer: We'll be heroes - the saviours of Baldur's Gate.\nNightwarden Minthara: Let them think that. There is a short path from saviour to ruler - a short and bloody path. I know it well, and we will walk it together.\nNightwarden Minthara: But Baldur's Gate is a mere bauble. We have the chance to seize something much greater. Surely you see it?\nNightwarden Minthara: In killing Ketheric, we fractured the cult's leadership. When we break the other Chosen and claim their Netherstones, we can take control.\nPlayer: What would we do with that power?\nNightwarden Minthara: The power of the enslaved elder brain could reshape the world. We could reshape the world.\nPlayer: It's going to be glorious - I can hardly wait.",
