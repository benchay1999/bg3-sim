Her hands are in a prayer position and she's chanting softly as the moonlight dances around her. She exhales, then inhales and breaths in tendrils of shadow, absorbing them. She swallows, then begins hacking coughing. The moonlight dissipates. She quickly goes from seeming like a divine spirit to a normal young woman.\nIsobel: I didn't realise I had an audience.\nFist Marcus: Isobel. This is -\nIsobel: A Sharran.\nNarrator: *Isobel. The same name as Ketheric Thorm's daughter - the one whose sarcophagus you found empty in the family mausoleum.*\nPlayer: Push your Urges down. Let's not let an ancient squabble interfere with the task at hand.\nIsobel: Not as ancient as you think. Frankly, I'm surprised you're willing to help us. Your kind aren't known for their decency - particularly when a Sharran curse is our greatest obstacle. But if you are who I think you are, I'd be a fool to reject your help. The True Soul with... well, a soul. Imagine.\nPlayer: You seem to have a lot to say about my allegiance. Can we focus on the task at hand?\nIsobel: I suppose that would be wise. We have a common enemy, after all: Ketheric Thorm. You'll be needing the protection spell, I presume? Oh - aren't you looking for a protection spell?\nPlayer: I am already protected. My Lady shields me from the curse.\nIsobel: For now, perhaps. But Shar can be fickle, and her love can prove fleeting. Do not turn your back on an advantage you may need... even a Selûnite one. If nothing else, it can aid any companions who travel with you - somehow I doubt Shar's largesse was extended to them.\nNarrator: *Pain bursts from the wound on your hand. You see yourself kneeling in a dark hall, surrounded by initiates. A female voice preaches against Selûne and all she stands for. You nod, rapt.*\nInternalNodeContext: Incurable wound imagery/memoriy fragment\nIsobel: Well! If the Moonmaiden didn't strike me dead for blessing you, she must rather approve of this little alliance. This will block the lesser effects of the shadow curse, allowing you to traverse the darkness outside... should Shar's own protection falter, that is. Curious. Surely the Nightsinger could have shielded all her followers, and made this place her domain long ago... yet she only acts now, and aids you alone. I wonder why.\nPlayer: The Dark Lady's works aren't for me to question.\nIsobel: Mustn't question the great shadow mother, must we? I'll stop needling you, though. You have more important things to do, after all.\nPlayer: Hold on - Marcus is a True Soul. He's here to kidnap you.",

It feels like you mean it.\nAstarion: Life's a joke, dear, but now we're the ones laughing. Oh my sweet, there are no vampires like me. And there never will be again. But if you want the gift of eternity, I can give you that. One more bite is all it would take. But if you want the gift of eternity, I can certainly offer you that. One little bite is all it would take. It would mean your salvation. Your eternity, despite that thing inside you. That's what you want, isn't it? To be mine? Forever?\nPlayer: What if I don't want forever?\nAstarion: What's not to want? We could be together for all time. My dark consort. My right hand. My most beloved spawn.\nPlayer: A beloved slave is still a slave.\nAstarion: Oh don't be like that, I'd never want to control you. I love you. That's what you've been waiting to hear, isn't it? That's what you want? We could be together for eternity, ruling this world side by side. We could have it all.\nPlayer: No, this isn't what I want.\nAstarion: It seems I misjudged you. I thought we might have a future together - even an eternity - but perhaps you're not worthy. So. What's it to be, darling? Is this it?\nPlayer: I hope we can work things out and stay together.\nAstarion: Of course we can. You're the one that I want - the one that I love. And you could be so much more, if you want it. One little bite and you could be mine forever. My dark consort. My right hand. My most beloved spawn.\nPlayer: Yes, that's all I want.\nAstarion: Then it's everything you shall recieve. I will miss this warm flesh, mind you. I knew you'd come around. Shall we have one last night together before you join me in immortality? One for the road, so to speak.\nPlayer: We shall not. I just need you to bite me.\nAstarion: Impatient are we?

    "conversation": "Gandrel: Ah, stranger. Forgive the aroma.\nNarrator: *You catch a waft of something foul - metallic and sickly-sweet.*\nGandrel: Powdered iron-vine. An old hunter's trick - most monsters will think twice before making a meal of me.\nAstarion: You're a monster hunter? I'm surprised - I thought all Gur were vagrant cut-throats.\nPlayer: Ignore the elf. He talks too much.\nGandrel: You should listen to your companion. Next he'll warn you that my people can curse your cow to give only sour milk and will seduce your daughter to a life of roaming. I wish I had half the power settled folk think my people possess. Alas, I am a simple wanderer. A simple wanderer and monster hunter. But I'm no witchdoctor or cut-throat.\nPlayer: I assume you want to kill the hag?\nAstarion: Or to make a deal with her. Probably think you can outfox the old dear.\nGandrel: Right, but very wrong. My prey is a vampire spawn - much less impressive than the beast that lives here. His name is Astarion, but I fear he's gone to ground. I hope the hag of these lands can help me flush him out, if I can afford her blood price.\nNodeContext: The hag's 'blood price' is likely to be something that'll cost him dearly.\nPlayer: Only a spawn? Pity. Not like it's a real vampire.\nAstarion: I don't know. I'm sure a vampire spawn could still rip your throat out if he felt like it.\nGandrel: He is right, unfortunately. They are only weak when compared to their masters. During the day, we have the advantage. But at night, when they hunt? You will not find a more deadly quarry.\nPlayer: Yes, I'm sure they can creep right up on you.\nAstarion: We've all survived so far. Let's focus on that.\nGandrel: It would still be wise to post guards at night. The threat is real.\nAstarion: Indeed it is. We should do something about this threat.\nPlayer: We'll be careful, but we should get going.\nAstarion: Don't you think we should do something about the... vampire issue?\nPlayer: I said we'll be careful. Now let's go.",

Why didn't you tell me?\nAstarion: At best, I was sure you'd say no. More likely, you'd ram a stake through my ribs. No, I needed you to trust me. And you can trust me.\nPlayer: I do. I believe you.\nAstarion: Thank you. Do you think you could trust me just a little further? I only need a taste, I swear.\nPlayer: Go ahead, if you want to burn your lips off.\nAstarion: Gods! I'd forgotten about your little affliction. Hunger does cloud your senses. I'll go and find something on four legs to eat, I suppose. See you in the morning.\nPlayer: No. Leave and never return.",

An old hunter's trick - most monsters will think twice before making a meal of me.\nAstarion: You're a monster hunter? I'm surprised - I thought all Gur were vagrant cut-throats.\nPlayer: Ignore the elf. He talks too much.\nGandrel: You should listen to your companion. Next he'll warn you that my people can curse your cow to give only sour milk and will seduce your daughter to a life of roaming. I wish I had half the power settled folk think my people possess. Alas, I am a simple wanderer. A simple wanderer and monster hunter. But I'm no witchdoctor or cut-throat.\nPlayer: I assume you want to kill the hag?\nAstarion: Or to make a deal with her. Probably think you can outfox the old dear.\nGandrel: Right, but very wrong. My prey is a vampire spawn - much less impressive than the beast that lives here. His name is Astarion, but I fear he's gone to ground. I hope the hag of these lands can help me flush him out, if I can afford her blood price.\nNodeContext: The hag's 'blood price' is likely to be something that'll cost him dearly.\nPlayer: Only a spawn? Pity. Not like it's a real vampire.\nAstarion: I don't know. I'm sure a vampire spawn could still rip your throat out if he felt like it.\nGandrel: He is right, unfortunately. They are only weak when compared to their masters. During the day, we have the advantage. But at night, when they hunt? You will not find a more deadly quarry.\nPlayer: Thank you for the warning, we'll be careful.\nGandrel: May your road be kind.\nAstarion: Wait - that's it? We're just walking away? Don't you think we should do something about the... vampire issue?\nPlayer: Fine. This is Astarion, the vampire spawn you're hunting.",

His name is Astarion, but I fear he's gone to ground. I was hoping the hag of these lands could help me flush him out, but it seems she is no more.\nPlayer: Only a spawn? Pity. Not like it's a real vampire.\nAstarion: I don't know. I'm sure a vampire spawn could still rip your throat out if he felt like it.\nGandrel: He is right, unfortunately. They are only weak when compared to their masters. During the day, we have the advantage. But at night, when they hunt? You will not find a more deadly quarry.\nPlayer: Thank you for the warning, we'll be careful.\nGandrel: May your road be kind.\nAstarion: Wait - that's it? We're just walking away?

And then I could have carried on, just like before.\nPlayer: How often were you disgusted by your targets?\nAstarion: I tried to pick beautiful people where I could, but there were so many over the years. After a while you stop caring. The entire reason for my existence was to seduce anything with a pulse. And every instinct I have tells me that nothing's changed.

Not political power or military power - I mean power over people. The power to control them completely. He turned me nearly two hundred years ago. I became his spawn and he became my tormentor.\nPlayer: Tormentor? What did he do?\nAstarion: He had me go out into Baldur's Gate to fetch him the most beautiful souls I could find. It was a fun little ritual of his - I'd bring them back and he'd ask if I wanted to dine with him. And if I said yes, he'd serve me a dead, putrid rat. Of course if I said no, he'd have me flayed. Hard to say which was worse.\nPlayer: Quite the sob story, but what's your point?\nAstarion: My point is simple... The mind flayers aren't the only monsters out there. They're not even the only ones hunting us. All I'm asking is that you keep your eyes open. And watch out for anything lurking in the shadows.\nPlayer: Oh no, my friend.

All you had to do was fall for it. And all I had to do was not fall for you... Which is where my nice, simple plan fell apart. You -... you're incredible. You deserve something real. I want us to be something real.\nPlayer: So do I. More than anything.\nAstarion: I just don't know what 'real' looks like. Not after two hundred years playing the rake. Being close to someone - any kind intimacy - was something I performed to lure people back for him. Even though I know things between us are different, being with someone still feels... tainted. Still brings up those feelings of disgust and loathing. I don't know how else to be with someone.

Cazador Szarr is a vampire lord in Baldur's Gate. The patriarch of his coven and a monster obsessed with power. Not political power or military power - I mean power over people. The power to control them completely. He turned me nearly two hundred years ago. I became his spawn and he became my tormentor.\nPlayer: Tormentor? What did he do?\nAstarion: He had me go out into Baldur's Gate to fetch him the most beautiful souls I could find. It was a fun little ritual of his - I'd bring them back and he'd ask if I wanted to dine with him. And if I said yes, he'd serve me a dead, putrid rat. Of course if I said no, he'd have me flayed. Hard to say which was worse.\nPlayer: That sounds terrible. I'm so sorry.\nAstarion: Thank you, but this isn't about sympathy. It's about knowing what we might be up against. The mind flayers aren't the only monsters out there. They're not even the only ones hunting us. All I'm asking is that you keep your eyes open. And watch out for anything lurking in the shadows.\nPlayer: Oh no, my friend. If vampires come looking for you, you're on your own.",

I spent two hundred years using my body to lure pretty things back for my Master. What I wanted, how I felt about what I was doing, it never mattered. You could have asked me to do the same - to throw myself at her, what I wanted be damned. But you didn't. And I'm grateful.\nPlayer: Are you getting sentimental on me?\nAstarion: Oh, don't look at me like that. I'm as surprised as you are. It's just... it would have been so easy to bite her. To just go along with what I was being told to do. A moment of disgust to force myself through. And then I could have carried on, just like before.\nPlayer: That would've been wrong.\nAstarion: The entire reason for my existence was to seduce anything with a pulse.

I became his spawn and he became my tormentor.\nPlayer: How were you turned? Did he attack you?\nAstarion: Not him, no. A gang of thugs attacked me, angry about a ruling that I'd handed down as magistrate. They beat me to death's door when Cazador appeared. He chased them off and offered to save me. To give me eternal life. Given that my choices were 'eternal life' or 'bleed to death on the street', I took him up on the offer. It was only afterwards I realised just how long 'eternity' could be.\nPlayer: Not a good master, I take it?\nAstarion: He had me go out into Baldur's Gate to fetch him the most beautiful souls I could find. It was a fun little ritual of his - I'd bring them back and he'd ask if I wanted to dine with him. And if I said yes, he'd serve me a dead, putrid rat. Of course if I said no, he'd have me flayed. Hard to say which was worse.\nPlayer: You're free now. Enjoy that freedom.\nAstarion: I will, but I won't take it for granted. The mind flayers aren't the only monsters out there. They're not even the only ones hunting us. All I'm asking is that you keep your eyes open. And watch out for anything lurking in the shadows.\nPlayer: Oh no, my friend. If vampires come looking for you, you're on your own.",

A gang of thugs attacked me, angry about a ruling that I'd handed down as magistrate. They beat me to death's door when Cazador appeared. He chased them off and offered to save me. To give me eternal life. Given that my choices were 'eternal life' or 'bleed to death on the street', I took him up on the offer. It was only afterwards I realised just how long 'eternity' could be.\nPlayer: You've been a slave ever since?\nAstarion: A vampire's spawn is less than a slave. They're a puppet. We have no choice but to obey our masters' commands. They speak and our bodies react - it's all part of the deal. Sometimes he'd order us to submit to torture.

By Ilmater's rack, that's... that's...\nPlayer: Unlikely?\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: It's fascinating! I should arrest you at once, but - well, the Bhaalspawn crisis, it's the most interesting criminal plight in Baldurian history. If what you claim is true, you wouldn't be helping me here unless you were trying to end Bhaal's hold over you. Just like the wayward Bhaalspawn who saved the Gate before... You are here to help me, and not to sacrifice me, aren't you?\nPlayer: Show her the target list. Say nothing of your intentions.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: I'm glad you're on the right side of this, Bhaalspawn. You could be invaluable, if you can get on the inside. Hells, you might be the only one who can stop this. What else do you know?\nPlayer: Bhaal is trying to force me to be his Chosen. I'm doing all I can to resist him.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: So it's all happening again... just like in Sarevok's time... A century ago, Bhaal bred dozens just like you. One of whom was Sarevok Anchev. For most, that was the end of it. But cults like that don't disappear overnight. That list you spoke of confirms I'm right. The Bhaal cult is back, and someone is out there, continuing Sarevok's work.\nPlayer: Not only is the cult back, it's spreading fast. I ran into some Bhaalists in the park.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: No doubt you found a trail of bodies in their wake? The brutality of the killings is on a par with Sarevok's own. But there's something more here, something new... There's a reverence to these murders, a certain flair. It's as if they were done in worship. The precision of the cuts, the depth, the execution - the best butchers in Faerûn couldn't make a cut like that. Trust me, I've asked them. I've done everything I can within the remit of my job. Any more, and they'll fire me. But you - you're not bound by such constraints. Help me out, here. Help the city out. I'll bet if you follow the trail of these murders, you'll be able to unearth the truth of this resurgence.\nPlayer: I'll do my best.",

I've had this condition for two centuries, but truth be told? You were my first. In all these years, I've only ever fed on beasts. Drinking the blood of thinking creatures is a different thing entirely. You were delectable. And now I just can't help but wonder how the others taste.\nPlayer: They might not be as open to the idea as I was.\nAstarion: Alas. It doesn't hurt to ponder the question, though. I don't think they'd volunteer, of course, but it doesn't make me any less curious. Take Karlach, for example, her blood aged in the Hells. She's potent, like a fiery whiskey. But the gith? What in the hells would she taste like?\nPlayer: Something exotic, surely? An Amnan liqueur?\nAstarion: Ohh, that sounds very appealing. I'm almost convinced.\nPlayer: This is still theoretical, right?\nAstarion: Absolutely. A mere thought experiment.

Hells, you might be the only one who can stop this. What else do you know?\nPlayer: I was hoping you could tell me more.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: Most of what I know is based on reading into Sarevok's history. I'm sure it's nothing next to your personal experience, but I'll share what I have. A century ago, Bhaal bred dozens just like you. One of whom was Sarevok Anchev. For most, that was the end of it.

The precision of the cuts, the depth, the execution - the best butchers in Faerûn couldn't make a cut like that. Trust me, I've asked them. I've done everything I can within the remit of my job. Any more, and they'll fire me. But you - you're not bound by such constraints. Help me out, here. Help the city out. Follow the trail of these murders. Prove the truth. Use your lineage to get places the Fist can't. I'll bet if you follow the trail of these murders, you'll be able to unearth the truth of this resurgence.\nPlayer: I'm going to stop my Father, whatever it takes.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: If anyone can, it will be you. Or at least that's what the legends say. But before you run off, do you think you could save a few more lives? There are patriars on the murder target list. I'm oathbound to secure them first, so I'll be heading to the Upper City next. While I'm there, the other potential victims will be at risk. Could you warn them?\nPlayer: I'll see what I can do.",

I suspect he's involved with this.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: Bhaal? That's exactly what I - wait. How do you know about that?\nPlayer: Don't panic, but I'm sort of... his spawn.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: Oh! Oh my. By Ilmater's rack, that's... that's...\nPlayer: Unfortunate?\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: It's fascinating! I should arrest you at once, but - well, the Bhaalspawn crisis, it's the most interesting criminal plight in Baldurian history. If what you claim is true, you wouldn't be helping me here unless you were trying to end Bhaal's hold over you. Just like the wayward Bhaalspawn who saved the Gate before... You are here to help me, and not to sacrifice me, aren't you?\nPlayer: I'm working against Bhaal - I found the murderer's target list.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: Gods - that's it! Proof that I was right. Gods... This is it. The proof that I was right! I've been working on an assignment, see - a research project of sorts. I knew my conclusions were sound, but this... I never expected this. I'll tell you what I know. A century ago, there was a man - Sarevok Anchev. He was a child of the god of murder, Bhaal. He ruled the Iron Throne - a dark tower hiding a darker secret. It was the front for a deadly arms-dealing network. There, Sarevok amassed an army and sought to become a god. Under his stewardship, the Bhaal Temple was revived, and with it, the Bhaal cult itself. Fortunately, the Temple was destroyed, and to cleanse the city of Sarevok's memory, the Iron Throne was torn from its foundations and cast into the Chionthar. For most, that was the end of it. But cults like that don't disappear overnight. This list you brought me confirms I'm right. The Bhaal cult is back, and someone is out there, continuing Sarevok's work.\nPlayer: You said Sarevok led the cultists a century ago - he can't still be alive, can he?\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: Stranger things have come back to haunt this city. The brutality of the killings is on a par with Sarevok's own. But there's something more here, something new... There's a reverence to these murders, a certain flair. It's as if they were done in worship. The precision of the cuts, the depth, the execution - the best butchers in Faerûn couldn't make a cut like that. Trust me, I've asked them. I've done everything I can within the remit of my job. Any more, and they'll fire me. But you - you're not bound by such constraints. Help me out, here. Help the city out. Follow the trail of these murders. Prove the truth. Use your lineage to get places the Fist can't. I'll bet if you follow the trail of these murders, you'll be able to unearth the truth of this resurgence.\nPlayer: What about the other victims on the list, the ones who are still alive?\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: There are patriars on the murder target list. I'm oathbound to secure them first, so I'll be heading to the Upper City next. While I'm there, the other potential victims will be at risk. Could you warn them?\nPlayer: I'll see what I can do.",

It is clear, now, that he was not working alone.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Leaves throne, standing from here on\nNightwarden Minthara: During my time in the cult, I came to know one of his co-conspirators all too well - Bhaal's blood-letter, Orin. I know one of them all too well - Bhaal's blood-letter, Orin. To think I thought her to be speaking for the Absolute. I worshipped that woman.\nPlayer: When I murder her, Bhaal will choose me in her place.\nNightwarden Minthara: I would prefer to put my faith in your strength than the favour of your god. After all, it is Orin and this grand deception that he chose - not you. He favours her, and she is one of the founders of this insane cult. Indeed, she is the one who indoctrinated me with the Absolute's lies.\nPlayer: What can you tell me about Orin?\nNightwarden Minthara: She is fierce, vicious, and cruel. In those respects, we are alike - but she is dangerously unpredictable. If there is a way to turn this design toward slaughter rather than control, she will take it. She is the one who brought me to Moonrise, and into the presence of her so-called god - the Absolute. Now I know that those memories are lies. There was no god. Orin held me down in a cocoon of flesh, while a mind flayer forced a parasite into my brain. And she laughed at my fear. I will find her, I will murder her. And I will smile.\nPlayer: Once she's dead, the cult will need new leadership - perhaps we can take her place.\nNightwarden Minthara: It is as if you read my mind. Perhaps you did.\nPlayer: Tempting, but eradicating the brain may be wiser, to put an end to this madness.\nNightwarden Minthara: Madness would be to let the Absolute's potential go to waste. The power of the enslaved elder brain could reshape the world. We could reshape the world.\nPlayer: The future you propose is shaped by violence. I'd prefer to find another way.",

By Ilmater's rack, that's... that's...\nPlayer: Abhorrent?\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: It's fascinating! I should arrest you at once, but - well, the Bhaalspawn crisis, it's the most interesting criminal plight in Baldurian history. If what you claim is true, you wouldn't be helping me here unless you were trying to end Bhaal's hold over you. Just like the wayward Bhaalspawn who saved the Gate before... You are here to help me, and not to sacrifice me, aren't you?\nPlayer: Tell her of the target list. Say nothing of your intentions.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: Gods - that's it! Proof that I was right. Gods... This is it. The proof that I was right! I've been working on an assignment, see - a research project of sorts. I knew my conclusions were sound, but this... I never expected this. I'll tell you what I know. A century ago, there was a man - Sarevok Anchev. He was a child of the god of murder, Bhaal. He ruled the Iron Throne - a dark tower hiding a darker secret. It was the front for a deadly arms-dealing network. There, Sarevok amassed an army and sought to become a god. Under his stewardship, the Bhaal Temple was revived, and with it, the Bhaal cult itself. Fortunately, the Temple was destroyed, and to cleanse the city of Sarevok's memory, the Iron Throne was torn from its foundations and cast into the Chionthar. For most, that was the end of it. But cults like that don't disappear overnight. This list you brought me confirms I'm right. The Bhaal cult is back, and someone is out there, continuing Sarevok's work.\nPlayer: You're not wrong about the cult. I found some Bhaalists in the sewers.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: No doubt you found a trail of bodies in their wake? The brutality of the killings is on a par with Sarevok's own. But there's something more here, something new... There's a reverence to these murders, a certain flair. It's as if they were done in worship. The precision of the cuts, the depth, the execution - the best butchers in Faerûn couldn't make a cut like that. Trust me, I've asked them. I've done everything I can within the remit of my job. Any more, and they'll fire me. But you - you're not bound by such constraints. Help me out, here. Help the city out. Follow the trail of these murders. Prove the truth. Use your lineage to get places the Fist can't. I'll bet if you follow the trail of these murders, you'll be able to unearth the truth of this resurgence.\nPlayer: I'll do my best.",

No!\nDrenn: You creaking old bag of shit!\nNodeContext: Drenn grabs a halberd from a surprised guard and throws it at Ketheric.\nKetheric Thorm: Hmm.\nNodeContext: KETHERIC stares at the halberd embedded in his chest in shock. Then, after a beat, he grunts in anger and pain as with one hand he grabs the halberd and pulls it free.

She's an unbeliever - outside my control.\nNodeContext: Very apologetic - this should never have happened\nKetheric Thorm: Try again.\nNodeContext: Ketheric drops the halberd on the ground and challenges the goblin.\nKetheric Thorm: Huh.\nNodeContext: Just been stabbed, but is invulnerable.\nDrenn: No - NO!\nNodeContext: terrified - you know you're about to die\nKetheric Thorm: Dispose of the rest as you see fit.

That's exactly what I - wait. How do you know about that?\nPlayer: Don't panic, but I'm sort of... his spawn.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: Oh! Oh my. By Ilmater's rack, that's... that's...\nPlayer: Abhorrent?\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: It's fascinating! I should arrest you at once, but - well, the Bhaalspawn crisis, it's the most interesting criminal plight in Baldurian history. If what you claim is true, you wouldn't be helping me here unless you were trying to end Bhaal's hold over you. Just like the wayward Bhaalspawn who saved the Gate before... You are here to help me, and not to sacrifice me, aren't you?\nPlayer: I am working against Bhaal - I got a hold of the list of murder targets.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: I'm glad you're on the right side of this, Bhaalspawn. You could be invaluable, if you can get on the inside. Hells, you might be the only one who can stop this. What else do you know?\nPlayer: I'm planning to infiltrate the cult, but I don't know where to start.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: Most of what I know is based on reading into Sarevok's history. I'm sure it's nothing next to your personal experience, but I'll share what I have. A century ago, Bhaal bred dozens just like you. One of whom was Sarevok Anchev. The Bhaal cult is back, and someone is out there, continuing Sarevok's work.\nPlayer: What makes you think it's not Sarevok himself?\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: I've not ruled out the possibility that it is Sarevok himself. The brutality of the killings is certainly reminiscent of his work. But there's something more here, something new... There's a reverence to these murders, a certain flair. It's as if they were done in worship. The precision of the cuts, the depth, the execution - the best butchers in Faerûn couldn't make a cut like that. Trust me, I've asked them. I've done everything I can within the remit of my job. Any more, and they'll fire me. But you - you're not bound by such constraints. Help me out, here. Help the city out. Follow the trail of these murders. Prove the truth. Use your lineage to get places the Fist can't. I'll bet if you follow the trail of these murders, you'll be able to unearth the truth of this resurgence.\nPlayer: I've got better things to do than investigate a cult.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: I suppose it was quite an ask... but perhaps you wouldn't mind doing me a different, smaller favour? There are patriars on the murder target list. I'm oathbound to secure them first, so I'll be heading to the Upper City next. While I'm there, the other potential victims will be at risk. Could you warn them?\nPlayer: I'll see what I can do.",

    "conversation": "Raphael: Do you know what happens when a devil is struck down on this charming plane of existence? It returns to the hells - to the very point where it last stood before venturing to whichever devilforsaken plane it died on. In the case of our friend Yurgir, the orthon you so handily dispatched in the temple of Shar, he manifested in my House of Hope. He returned to me chastened but intact, his wounds healed, his body restored. He thought I would dismember him but he has his uses so instead I am reeducating him.\nAstarion: We delivered the devil. Now I want what I'm owed - we had a deal.\nRaphael: Indeed we did. I discovered all there is to know about those scars of yours - it's a rather grim tale, even for my tastes.\nPlayer: Please, give me more boring details about your plans.\nRaphael: Come now, we're about to unveil your destiny - you should be quivering in anticipation.\n And why would he want to walk away? This is his destiny. As you know already, your precious skin is home to one part of a contract between the archdevil Mephistopheles, and your former master, Cazador Szarr. In full, the contract states that Cazador will be granted knowledge of an infernal ritual so vile it has never been performed. The Rite of Profane Ascension. It promises to be a marvellous ceremony. Very elaborate, incredibly ancient, and entirely diabolical. If he completes the rite, he will become a new kind of being - the Vampire Ascendant. All the strengths of his vampiric form will be amplified, and alongside them he will enjoy the luxuries of the living. The arousals and appetites of man will return to him, and unlike Astarion, he will have no need of a parasite to protect him from the sun. But the ritual has its price, as all worthwhile things do. Lord Cazador will need to sacrifice a number of souls, including all of his vampiric spawn, if he is to ascend. Imagine how he felt, then, when one of those precious spawn simply disappeared into thin air. The only missing ingredient is Astarion. You are the final piece he requires to complete the ritual - your scars bind you to it. Your soul will set off a very wave of death, bringing Cazador his twisted life.

What do you think I should do?\nPlayer: There's a way to become a living vampire... That must mean a lot to you.\nAstarion: The idea definitely has appeal. I could get rid of the worm in my head and still walk in the sun. I'd finally be free of the hunger. And if I'm the key to this deal of Cazador's, perhaps I can turn this to my advantage... I need to take the fight to him. And I need you to help me.\nPlayer: If he comes for you, I'll defend you. But we're not risking an attack on his lair.\nAstarion: If you won't risk taking him on for my sake, think of the innocent souls he'll sacrifice in this ritual.\nPlayer: We're done talking about this, Astarion.

You are here to help me, and not to sacrifice me, aren't you?\nPlayer: Show her the target list. Say nothing of your intentions.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: I'm glad you're on the right side of this, Bhaalspawn. You could be invaluable, if you can get on the inside. Hells, you might be the only one who can stop this. What else do you know?\nPlayer: I was hoping you could tell me more.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: Most of what I know is based on reading into Sarevok's history. I'm sure it's nothing next to your personal experience, but I'll share what I have. A century ago, Bhaal bred dozens just like you. One of whom was Sarevok Anchev. The Bhaal cult is back, and someone is out there, continuing Sarevok's work.\nPlayer: Not only is the cult back, it's spreading fast. I ran into some Bhaalists in the park.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: No doubt you found a trail of bodies in their wake? The brutality of the killings is on a par with Sarevok's own. But there's something more here, something new... There's a reverence to these murders, a certain flair. It's as if they were done in worship. The precision of the cuts, the depth, the execution - the best butchers in Faerûn couldn't make a cut like that. Trust me, I've asked them. I tried to explain all this to my superiors, but they wouldn't have any of it. They told me to drop it. Told me the city doesn't need another conspiracy theorist and to get back to doing my job before they find someone else to do it for me. But you - you're not bound by such constraints. Help me out, here. Help the city out. Follow the trail of these murders. Prove the truth. Use your lineage to get places the Fist can't. I'll bet if you follow the trail of these murders, you'll be able to unearth the truth of this resurgence.\nPlayer: What will you do in the meantime?\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: There are patriars on the murder target list. I'm oathbound to secure them first, so I'll be heading to the Upper City next. While I'm there, the other potential victims will be at risk. Could you warn them?\nPlayer: I'll see what I can do.",

Tell me, what can the Society do for you?\nPlayer: I carry an unhatched githyanki egg. Would you be interested in studying it?\nHavkelaag: A githyanki egg? What a fortuitous turn of events. I've been attempting to get my hands on one for some time now. Would you consider parting with it? The Society's coffers are deep enough to cover any expenses accrued in its retrieval, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: Chk. Don't you dare consider it.\nPlayer: What are you going to do with it?\nHavkelaag: Study it, of course. The githyanki have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months. You are no doubt aware that citizens of the Underdark are held in great suspicion by those who live above ground. Many believe us to be 'evil'. The githyanki face similar prejudice, but I believe, if hatched in a less violent, more intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome its evil predispositions. I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: You're letting your personal biases affect your method. Why assume they're evil?\nHavkelaag: I assume nothing. Innate githyanki cruelty is an established fact - no doubt you witnessed it yourself in the retrieval of the egg itself. When I have a suitable sample for my study, I will, however, prove that the effects of their biological inclination are reversible. Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue. Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: Why follow the dogma of a draconic god?\nHavkelaag: In my years of study, they're the closest I've found to moral perfection. Only under such rigorous 'goodness' will the subject stand a chance of being cured. My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: Your findings are irrelevant, as are the opinions of all on this kaincha plane.\nHavkelaag: Ah. A display of the well-known githyanki arrogance. I am not sure my experiment can cure that particular affliction, but give me time and I will find a way. Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg? ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: A gith hatchling is not a lab rat!

I should arrest you at once, but - well, the Bhaalspawn crisis, it's the most interesting criminal plight in Baldurian history. If what you claim is true, you wouldn't be helping me here unless you were trying to end Bhaal's hold over you. Just like the wayward Bhaalspawn who saved the Gate before... You are here to help me, and not to sacrifice me, aren't you?\nPlayer: I'm working against Bhaal - I found the murderer's target list.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: Gods - that's it! Proof that I was right. Gods... This is it. The proof that I was right! I've been working on an assignment, see - a research project of sorts. I knew my conclusions were sound, but this... I never expected this. I'll tell you what I know. A century ago, there was a man - Sarevok Anchev. He was a child of the god of murder, Bhaal. He ruled the Iron Throne - a dark tower hiding a darker secret. It was the front for a deadly arms-dealing network. There, Sarevok amassed an army and sought to become a god. Under his stewardship, the Bhaal Temple was revived, and with it, the Bhaal cult itself. Fortunately, the Temple was destroyed, and to cleanse the city of Sarevok's memory, the Iron Throne was torn from its foundations and cast into the Chionthar. For most, that was the end of it. But cults like that don't disappear overnight. That list you spoke of confirms I'm right. The Bhaal cult is back, and someone is out there, continuing Sarevok's work.\nPlayer: Any idea who it is?\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: No idea, unfortunately. But whoever it is, they are intimately familiar with Sarevok's work. The brutality of the killings is on a par with Sarevok's own. But there's something more here, something new... There's a reverence to these murders, a certain flair. It's as if they were done in worship. The precision of the cuts, the depth, the execution - the best butchers in Faerûn couldn't make a cut like that. Trust me, I've asked them. I tried to explain all this to my superiors, but they wouldn't have any of it. They told me to drop it. Told me the city doesn't need another conspiracy theorist and to get back to doing my job before they find someone else to do it for me. But you - you're not bound by such constraints. Help me out, here. Help the city out. Follow the trail of these murders. Prove the truth. Use your lineage to get places the Fist can't. I'll bet if you follow the trail of these murders, you'll be able to unearth the truth of this resurgence.\nPlayer: What about the other victims on the list, the ones who are still alive?\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: There are patriars on the murder target list. I'm oathbound to secure them first, so I'll be heading to the Upper City next. While I'm there, the other potential victims will be at risk. Could you warn them?\nPlayer: I'll see what I can do.",

It returns to the hells - to the very point where it last stood before venturing to whichever devilforsaken plane it died on. In the case of our friend Yurgir, the orthon you so handily dispatched in the temple of Shar, he manifested in my House of Hope. He returned to me chastened but intact, his wounds healed, his body restored. He thought I would dismember him but he has his uses so instead I am reeducating him.\nAstarion: We delivered the devil. Now I want what I'm owed - we had a deal.\nRaphael: Indeed we did. I discovered all there is to know about those scars of yours - it's a rather grim tale, even for my tastes.\nPlayer: We had a deal - the orthon for information.\nRaphael: Indeed we did. I discovered all there is to know about those scars of yours - it's a rather grim tale, even for my tastes.\nPlayer: Stop stalling.\nRaphael: As you wish. Brace yourself, Astarion - we're about to unveil your destiny. And why would he want to walk away? This is his destiny. As you know already, your precious skin is home to one part of a contract between the archdevil Mephistopheles, and your former master, Cazador Szarr. In full, the contract states that Cazador will be granted knowledge of an infernal ritual so vile it has never been performed. The Rite of Profane Ascension. It promises to be a marvellous ceremony. Very elaborate, incredibly ancient, and entirely diabolical. If he completes the rite, he will become a new kind of being - the Vampire Ascendant. All the strengths of his vampiric form will be amplified, and alongside them he will enjoy the luxuries of the living. The arousals and appetites of man will return to him, and unlike Astarion, he will have no need of a parasite to protect him from the sun. But the ritual has its price, as all worthwhile things do. Lord Cazador will need to sacrifice a number of souls, including all of his vampiric spawn, if he is to ascend. Imagine how he felt, then, when one of those precious spawn simply disappeared into thin air. The only missing ingredient is Astarion. You are the final piece he requires to complete the ritual - your scars bind you to it. Your soul will set off a very wave of death, bringing Cazador his twisted life. And that, my tragic and toothsome friend, is that. Now if you'll excuse me, I have business elsewhere.\nNodeContext: [Tarik] snaps fingers at the end of the line.\nAstarion: Hmm...\nPlayer: You're... quiet. It's unsettling.\nAstarion: It's a lot to take in. What do you think I should do?\nPlayer: I think you should run. If Cazador can't find you, he can't complete his ritual.\n\nAstarion: How long do you think I can run? He has eternity to find me. He'll never leave me alone. I didn't think he would when I was just one more wretched toy for him to play with. But if I'm the key to this power he craves, he'll hunt me to the ends of Faerûn. I need to take the fight to him. And I need you to help me.\nPlayer: After we dealt with our tadpole problem, yes, I'll help you then.\nAstarion: Once we deal with the tadpole, I'll be back to my nocturnal self. When you're being hunted by vampires, the dark is the worst place to hide. I need to deal with Cazador while I still have any kind of advantage over him. If you won't risk taking him on for my sake, think of the innocent souls he'll sacrifice in this ritual.\nPlayer: We're done talking about this, Astarion. My decision is made.",

Duke Stelmane's dead - and I've got to find who killed her.\nPlayer: I know more about Bhaal than anyone you'll find. You don't want to send me away.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: Bhaal? That's exactly what I - wait. How do you know about that?\nPlayer: Don't panic, but I'm sort of... his spawn.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: Oh! Oh my. By Ilmater's rack, that's... that's...\nPlayer: Abhorrent?\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: It's fascinating! I should arrest you at once, but - well, the Bhaalspawn crisis, it's the most interesting criminal plight in Baldurian history. If what you claim is true, you wouldn't be helping me here unless you were trying to end Bhaal's hold over you. Just like the wayward Bhaalspawn who saved the Gate before... You are here to help me, and not to sacrifice me, aren't you?\nPlayer: I am working against Bhaal - I got a hold of the list of murder targets.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: I'm glad you're on the right side of this, Bhaalspawn. You could be invaluable, if you can get on the inside. Hells, you might be the only one who can stop this. What else do you know?\nPlayer: I was hoping you could tell me more.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: Most of what I know is based on reading into Sarevok's history. I'm sure it's nothing next to your personal experience, but I'll share what I have. A century ago, Bhaal bred dozens just like you. One of whom was Sarevok Anchev. For most, that was the end of it. But cults like that don't disappear overnight. That list you spoke of confirms I'm right. The Bhaal cult is back, and someone is out there, continuing Sarevok's work.\nPlayer: I think it may be a Bhaalspawn...\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: Gods save us all if you're right, but I'd believe it. Whoever it is, they are intimately familiar with Sarevok's work. The brutality of the killings is on a par with Sarevok's own. But there's something more here, something new... There's a reverence to these murders, a certain flair. It's as if they were done in worship. The precision of the cuts, the depth, the execution - the best butchers in Faerûn couldn't make a cut like that. Trust me, I've asked them. I've done everything I can within the remit of my job. Any more, and they'll fire me. But you - you're not bound by such constraints. Help me out, here. Help the city out. I'll bet if you follow the trail of these murders, you'll be able to unearth the truth of this resurgence.\nPlayer: I've got better things to do than investigate a cult.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: I suppose it was quite an ask... but perhaps you wouldn't mind doing me a different, smaller favour? There are patriars on the murder target list. I'm oathbound to secure them first, so I'll be heading to the Upper City next. While I'm there, the other potential victims will be at risk. Could you warn them?\nPlayer: I'll see what I can do.",

I never expected this. I'll tell you what I know. A century ago, there was a man - Sarevok Anchev. He was a child of the god of murder, Bhaal. He ruled the Iron Throne - a dark tower hiding a darker secret. It was the front for a deadly arms-dealing network. There, Sarevok amassed an army and sought to become a god. Under his stewardship, the Bhaal Temple was revived, and with it, the Bhaal cult itself.

Not that anyone's volunteered, it's just an idle fancy.\nPlayer: I wouldn't expect any volunteers either.\nAstarion: Alas. It doesn't hurt to ponder the question, though.

Still, I am intrigued by the possibilities...\nPlayer: Could I convince you to kill someone less useful?\nAstarion: No one's getting killed, I swear. We're just two friends talking.

You're aware of the monster inside you. You don't bow to the Absolute, like the True Souls do... How is this possible...?\nPlayer: I escaped from an illithid ship after being infected. Maybe the process was interrupted.\nHalsin: Perhaps... but I wouldn't want to place all my faith in blind luck. You weren't speaking lightly when you said you needed help. Let me tell you what I know. I've been studying these parasites for a while now. Ever since I discovered these so-called True Souls are infected with them. Someone is using very powerful magic to modify these tadpoles. They are using them to exert control over the infected. I'm sorry to say, I can't undo that magic, which means I can't cure you. But that doesn't mean I can't help. I didn't find what I came here for - a way to remove the tadpoles - but I found the next best thing. I found out where they come from. That must be where these enchantments are placed on them, and it's where you'll find your cure.\nPlayer: You learned all this from your studies?\nHalsin: Indeed. After we dealt with the drow that ambushed us, Nettie and I were able to inspect the corpse - and the creature that slithered out of it. I had no idea anyone beyond their ranks was infected. You have my sincere sympathies.\nPlayer: Sympathies won't help me to survive.\nHalsin: Patience. I can't just snap my fingers... but I know where the solution almost certainly lies. I overheard that the cultists are sending all of their captives to Moonrise Towers. Innocents go in, True Souls come out. Given that all of these True Souls are infected, it has to be the source of this magic. If you want to find a cure, you must head there and discover how the tadpoles are being manipulated.\nPlayer: You seem to know a lot about this. Will you come with me to Moonrise?\nHalsin: I wish I could, but there's still work I've yet to finish - blood I've yet to spill. I've no right to ask more of you... but if you could help me, I'd be free to join your journey to Moonrise. I cannot allow these butchers to threaten my grove. The natural order must be protected.\nPlayer: All right. How do I help?\nHalsin: My thanks. If you prevail, I'll owe you the debt of a lifetime. It's too late to stop things from here - the goblins are already marching on the grove in force. You must get ahead of them, muster the defences.\nPlayer: Very well. I'll go rescue the grove.",

Under his stewardship, the Bhaal Temple was revived, and with it, the Bhaal cult itself. Fortunately, the Temple was destroyed, and to cleanse the city of Sarevok's memory, the Iron Throne was torn from its foundations and cast into the Chionthar. For most, that was the end of it.

The githyanki have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months. You are no doubt aware that citizens of the Underdark are held in great suspicion by those who live above ground. Many believe us to be 'evil'. The githyanki face similar prejudice, but I believe, if hatched in a less violent, more intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome its evil predispositions. I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: You're letting your personal biases affect your method. Why assume they're evil?\nHavkelaag: I assume nothing. Innate githyanki cruelty is an established fact - no doubt you witnessed it yourself in the retrieval of the egg itself. When I have a suitable sample for my study, I will, however, prove that the effects of their biological inclination are reversible. Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue. Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: You would teach the child virtue, but rear it without patience. Curious.\nHavkelaag: Tell me, then, philosopher - if patience delays the fostering of the other virtues, can it be rightly called virtuous?\nPlayer: By your words, any virtue delaying patience would itself be unvirtuous.\nHavkelaag: And therein lies your fault: you would have us argue in circles until the egg hatches naturally. Time we do not have. My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: And what if your experiment fails?\nHavkelaag: If the child remains evil after the experiment is concluded, it will be destroyed. Such is the fate of all used specimens. Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg?

I should arrest you at once, but - well, the Bhaalspawn crisis, it's the most interesting criminal plight in Baldurian history. If what you claim is true, you wouldn't be helping me here unless you were trying to end Bhaal's hold over you. Just like the wayward Bhaalspawn who saved the Gate before... You are here to help me, and not to sacrifice me, aren't you?\nPlayer: Show her the target list. Say nothing of your intentions.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: I'm glad you're on the right side of this, Bhaalspawn. You could be invaluable, if you can get on the inside. Hells, you might be the only one who can stop this. What else do you know?\nPlayer: Father has shown me visions - the Temple of Bhaal lurks somewhere in the city.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: So it's all happening again... just like in Sarevok's time... A century ago, Bhaal bred dozens just like you. One of whom was Sarevok Anchev. For most, that was the end of it. But cults like that don't disappear overnight. That list you spoke of confirms I'm right. The Bhaal cult is back, and someone is out there, continuing Sarevok's work.\nPlayer: You said Sarevok led the cultists a century ago - he can't still be alive, can he?\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: Stranger things have come back to haunt this city. The brutality of the killings is on a par with Sarevok's own. But there's something more here, something new... There's a reverence to these murders, a certain flair. It's as if they were done in worship. The precision of the cuts, the depth, the execution - the best butchers in Faerûn couldn't make a cut like that. Trust me, I've asked them. I've done everything I can within the remit of my job. Any more, and they'll fire me. But you - you're not bound by such constraints. Help me out, here. Help the city out. Follow the trail of these murders. Prove the truth. Use your lineage to get places the Fist can't. I'll bet if you follow the trail of these murders, you'll be able to unearth the truth of this resurgence.\nPlayer: What will you do in the meantime?\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: There are patriars on the murder target list. I'm oathbound to secure them first, so I'll be heading to the Upper City next. While I'm there, the other potential victims will be at risk. Could you warn them?\nPlayer: I'll see what I can do.",

    "conversation": "Raphael: Do you know what happens when a devil is struck down on this charming plane of existence? It returns to the hells - to the very point where it last stood before venturing to whichever devilforsaken plane it died on. In the case of our friend Yurgir, the orthon you so handily dispatched in the temple of Shar, he manifested in my House of Hope. He returned to me chastened but intact, his wounds healed, his body restored. He thought I would dismember him but he has his uses so instead I am reeducating him.\nAstarion: We delivered the devil. Now I want what I'm owed - we had a deal.\nRaphael: Indeed we did. I discovered all there is to know about those scars of yours - it's a rather grim tale, even for my tastes.\nPlayer: We had a deal - the orthon for information.\nRaphael: Indeed we did. I discovered all there is to know about those scars of yours - it's a rather grim tale, even for my tastes.\nPlayer: We had a deal - the orthon for information.\nRaphael: Indeed we did.

We're about to unveil your destiny - you should be quivering in anticipation. As you know already, your precious skin is home to one part of a contract between the archdevil Mephistopheles, and your former master, Cazador Szarr. In full, the contract states that Cazador will be granted knowledge of an infernal ritual so vile it has never been performed. The Rite of Profane Ascension. It promises to be a marvellous ceremony. Very elaborate, incredibly ancient, and entirely diabolical. If he completes the rite, he will become a new kind of being - the Vampire Ascendant. All the strengths of his vampiric form will be amplified, and alongside them he will enjoy the luxuries of the living. The arousals and appetites of man will return to him, and unlike Astarion, he will have no need of a parasite to protect him from the sun. But the ritual has its price, as all worthwhile things do. Lord Cazador will need to sacrifice a number of souls, including all of his vampiric spawn, if he is to ascend. Imagine how he felt, then, when one of those precious spawn simply disappeared into thin air. The only missing ingredient is Astarion. You are the final piece he requires to complete the ritual - your scars bind you to it. Your soul will set off a very wave of death, bringing Cazador his twisted life. And that, my tragic and toothsome friend, is that. Now if you'll excuse me, I have business elsewhere.\nNodeContext: [Tarik] snaps fingers at the end of the line.\nAstarion: Hmm...\nPlayer: You're... quiet. It's unsettling.\nAstarion: It's a lot to take in. What do you think I should do?\nPlayer: There's a way to become a living vampire... That must mean a lot to you.\nAstarion: The idea definitely has appeal. I could get rid of the worm in my head and still walk in the sun. I'd finally be free of the hunger. And if I'm the key to this deal of Cazador's, perhaps I can turn this to my advantage... I need to take the fight to him. And I need you to help me.\nPlayer: Not a chance.\nAstarion: If you won't risk taking him on for my sake, think of the innocent souls he'll sacrifice in this ritual.\nPlayer: We're done talking about this, Astarion.

    "conversation": "Raphael: Do you know what happens when a devil is struck down on this charming plane of existence? It returns to the hells - to the very point where it last stood before venturing to whichever devilforsaken plane it died on. In the case of our friend Yurgir, the orthon you so handily dispatched in the temple of Shar, he manifested in my House of Hope. He returned to me chastened but intact, his wounds healed, his body restored. He thought I would dismember him but he has his uses so instead I am reeducating him.\nAstarion: We delivered the devil. Now I want what I'm owed - we had a deal.\nRaphael: Indeed we did. I discovered all there is to know about those scars of yours - it's a rather grim tale, even for my tastes.\nPlayer: We had a deal - the orthon for information.\nRaphael: Indeed we did. I discovered all there is to know about those scars of yours - it's a rather grim tale, even for my tastes.\nPlayer: Spill it - this sounds fascinating.\nAstarion: I'd appreciate a little less enthusiasm when it comes to Cazador and his horrors.\nRaphael: Oh come, Astarion. We're about to unveil your destiny - you should be quivering in anticipation. Carved into that ivory skin of yours is one part of an infernal contract between the archdevil Mephistopheles and your former master, Cazador Szarr. In full, the contract states that Cazador will be granted knowledge of an infernal ritual so vile it has never been performed. The Rite of Profane Ascension. It promises to be a marvellous ceremony. Very elaborate, incredibly ancient, and entirely diabolical. If he completes the rite, he will become a new kind of being - the Vampire Ascendant. All the strengths of his vampiric form will be amplified, and alongside them he will enjoy the luxuries of the living. The arousals and appetites of man will return to him, and unlike you, he will have no need of a parasite to protect him from the sun. But the ritual has its price, as all worthwhile things do. Lord Cazador will need to sacrifice a number of souls, including all of his vampiric spawn, if he is to ascend. Imagine how he felt, then, when one of those precious spawn simply disappeared into thin air. The only missing ingredient is Astarion. You are the final piece he requires to complete the ritual - your scars bind you to it. Your soul will set off a very wave of death, bringing Cazador his twisted life. And that, my tragic and toothsome friend, is that. Now if you'll excuse me, I have business elsewhere.\nNodeContext: [Tarik] snaps fingers at the end of the line.\nAstarion: Hmm...\nPlayer: Cazador is a piece of shit. We're going to stop him.\nAstarion: Do you think it's so simple? What do you think I should do?\nPlayer: We can't let Cazador complete that ritual. He could unleash terrible horrors.\nAstarion: The end of my life among them. Just when I was starting to enjoy it. He'll never leave me alone. I didn't think he would when I was just one more wretched toy for him to play with. But if I'm the key to this power he craves, he'll hunt me to the ends of Faerûn. I need to take the fight to him. And I need you to help me.\nPlayer: If he comes for you, I'll defend you. But we're not risking an attack on his lair.\nAstarion: If you won't risk taking him on for my sake, think of the innocent souls he'll sacrifice in this ritual.\nPlayer: The Absolute is a greater threat - we need to focus.",

Tensions seem high around here.\nGROUP_Act3_WYR_OrinsImpersonation_FlamingFist: 'Tensions'? That's putting it mildly. Some well-to-do's in the city donated enough to see the newcomers right for the time being. Only they didn't bother helping everyone else. Locals going without while strangers feast - it's stoked the fire, all right. Some Baldurians are kicking up a fuss round the front of the barn as we speak. If I wasn't wearing this uniform, I'd walk round there and teach them a lesson they'd never forget.\nPlayer: If the refugees have more than they need, it's only fair they give some back.\nGROUP_Act3_WYR_OrinsImpersonation_FlamingFist: Too bloody right. But will they share? Not a chance. Those refugees have been leeching on our city for too long. If we don't show them we mean business, they'll bleed us dry. We need to march round the front, and kill every last one of them. Let's see them eat our food with their guts on the floor. What do you say?\nPlayer: They're innocent people. You can't just kill them!",

It obviously put me off your neck, but now I can't help but wonder how the others taste. Not that anyone's volunteered, it's just an idle fancy.\nPlayer: I wouldn't expect any volunteers either.\nAstarion: Alas. It doesn't hurt to ponder the question, though. I don't think they'd volunteer, of course, but it doesn't make me any less curious. Take Shadowheart, for example. She strikes me as having a heavy, enigmatic flavour - vintage port on two legs. But the gith? What in the hells would she taste like?\nPlayer: I'd prefer a beer, if it's all the same to you.\nAstarion: Yes, heavens forbid we'd have an interesting conversation. Still, I am intrigued by the possibilities...\nPlayer: Keep your eyes to yourself. You'll make people nervous.\nAstarion: Relax, we're just talking. So - in the spirit of theoretical questions - if you had to take a bite from one of them, who would it be?\nPlayer: Gale, no question.\nAstarion: I'm all too familiar with Gale's blood, unfortunately. I can't recommend it. But the gith? What in the hells would she taste like?\nPlayer: Something exotic, surely? An Amnan liqueur?\nAstarion: Ohh, that sounds very appealing.

A true friend of nature - or perhaps a lunatic. Either way, I owe thanks. I am the druid Halsin.\nPlayer: I spoke to Nettie - she said you could help me with the parasite in my head.\nHalsin: Parasite in your head...? You mean you have one of them?\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Halsin raises a hand to your head, magically connecting with you (no contact). He gives an alarmed look - he knows what’s inside you\nHalsin: Oak Father preserve you, child... You're infected, aren't you? The mind flayers' spawn. But... something's different. You're aware of the monster inside you. You don't bow to the Absolute, like the True Souls do... How is this possible...?\nPlayer: I don't know.\nHalsin: You weren't speaking lightly when you said you needed help. Let me tell you what I know. I've been studying these parasites for a while now. Ever since I discovered these so-called True Souls are infected with them. Someone is using very powerful magic to modify these tadpoles. They are using them to exert control over the infected. I'm sorry to say, I can't undo that magic, which means I can't cure you. But that doesn't mean I can't help. I didn't find what I came here for - a way to remove the tadpoles - but I found the next best thing. I found out where they come from. That must be where these enchantments are placed on them, and it's where you'll find your cure.\nPlayer: You learned all this from your studies?\nHalsin: Indeed. After we dealt with the drow that ambushed us, Nettie and I were able to inspect the corpse - and the creature that slithered out of it. I had no idea anyone beyond their ranks was infected. You have my sincere sympathies.\nPlayer: What should I do?\nHalsin: I overheard that the cultists are sending all of their captives to Moonrise Towers. Innocents go in, True Souls come out. Given that all of these True Souls are infected, it has to be the source of this magic. If you want to find a cure, you must head there and discover how the tadpoles are being manipulated.\nPlayer: You seem to know a lot about this. Will you come with me to Moonrise?\nHalsin: I wish I could, but there's still work I've yet to finish - blood I've yet to spill. I've no right to ask more of you... but if you could help me, I'd be free to join your journey to Moonrise. I cannot allow these butchers to threaten my grove. The natural order must be protected.\nPlayer: Look around you - there's no order anymore. Only chaos.\nHalsin: Chaos is welcome, in doses; it helps keep balance. But this is too much - this is unnatural. It's too late to merely kill this horde's leadership - their forces are already marching. If you want me to help, you need to help me first. You must get ahead of them, muster the defences.\nPlayer: Very well. I'll go rescue the grove.",

Whatever your business, I'd see to it quickly - the druids are forcing everyone out. This attack will only strengthen their resolve.\nPlayer: Why are they forcing you out?\nZevlor: There have been several attacks by different monsters. The druids blame us 'outsiders' for drawing them here. Nobody's welcome anymore. They've started a ritual to cut the grove off from the world outside. We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: What brought you here?\nZevlor: We're refugees from Elturel - we took shelter here after gnolls attacked us on the road. We were bound for Baldur's Gate, and it was too late to turn back. Elturel had no place for tieflings after the Descent.\nPlayer: Is there a place for tieflings anywhere?\nZevlor: Hah - a fair point.

But we've lost so many already - and more will die if we're forced out again. We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: This ritual - is there no way to convince the druids to stop it?\nZevlor: I've tried.

It obviously put me off your neck, but now I can't help but wonder how the others taste. Not that anyone's volunteered, it's just an idle fancy.\nPlayer: I wouldn't expect any volunteers either.\nAstarion: Alas. It doesn't hurt to ponder the question, though. I don't think they'd volunteer, of course, but it doesn't make me any less curious. Take Shadowheart, for example. She strikes me as having a heavy, enigmatic flavour - vintage port on two legs. But the gith? What in the hells would she taste like?\nPlayer: Something exotic, surely? An Amnan liqueur?\nAstarion: Ohh, that sounds very appealing. I'm almost convinced.\nPlayer: This is still theoretical, right?\nAstarion: Absolutely. A mere thought experiment. So - in the spirit of theoretical questions - if you had to take a bite from one of them, who would it be?\nPlayer: Are you really asking which of our companions I'd eat?\nAstarion: Oh no, don't be disgusting. I just mean a sip of their blood. No mastication required. So - in the spirit of theoretical questions - if you had to take a bite from one of them, who would it be?\nPlayer: I much prefer eating flesh to blood.\nAstarion: I do appreciate your enthusiasm, but let's try to restrain ourselves a little. I just mean a sip of their blood. No mastication required. So - in the spirit of theoretical questions - if you had to take a bite from one of them, who would it be?\nPlayer: Gale, no question.\nAstarion: I'm all too familiar with Gale's blood, unfortunately. I can't recommend it. But the gith? What in the hells would she taste like?\nPlayer: I'd prefer a beer, if it's all the same to you.\nAstarion: Yes, heavens forbid we'd have an interesting conversation. Still, I am intrigued by the possibilities...\nPlayer: Could I convince you to kill someone less useful?\nAstarion: No one's getting killed, I swear. We're just two friends talking. So - in the spirit of theoretical questions - if you had to take a bite from one of them, who would it be?\nPlayer: Are you really asking which of our companions I'd eat?\nAstarion: Oh no, don't be disgusting.

Tell me, what can the Society do for you?\nPlayer: I carry an unhatched githyanki egg. Would you be interested in studying it?\nHavkelaag: A githyanki egg? What a fortuitous turn of events. I've been attempting to get my hands on one for some time now. Would you consider parting with it? The Society's coffers are deep enough to cover any expenses accrued in its retrieval, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: Chk. Don't you dare consider it.\nPlayer: What are you going to do with it?\nHavkelaag: Study it, of course. The githyanki have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months. You are no doubt aware that citizens of the Underdark are held in great suspicion by those who live above ground. Many believe us to be 'evil'. The githyanki face similar prejudice, but I believe, if hatched in a less violent, more intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome its evil predispositions. I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: What does this 'intellectually stimulating' upbringing look like?\nHavkelaag: In the literal sense, I will need to induce the egg to hatch via the application of certain currents to the creature inside. Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue. Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: You would teach the child virtue, but rear it without patience. Curious.\nHavkelaag: Tell me, then, philosopher - if patience delays the fostering of the other virtues, can it be rightly called virtuous?\nPlayer: Perhaps not. Patience is important, but cannot impede the other virtues.\nHavkelaag: Then we are in accord - the time for action is now. My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: And what if your experiment fails?\nHavkelaag: If the child remains evil after the experiment is concluded, it will be destroyed. Such is the fate of all used specimens. Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg? ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: A gith hatchling is not a lab rat!

Tell me, what can the Society do for you?\nPlayer: I carry an unhatched githyanki egg. Would you be interested in studying it?\nHavkelaag: A githyanki egg? What a fortuitous turn of events. I've been attempting to get my hands on one for some time now. Would you consider parting with it? The Society's coffers are deep enough to cover any expenses accrued in its retrieval, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: Chk. Don't you dare consider it.\nPlayer: What are you going to do with it?\nHavkelaag: Study it, of course. The githyanki have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months. You yourself have no doubt experienced the prejudice of those who assume that, as beings of the Underdark, we are inherently evil. The githyanki face similar prejudice, but I believe, if hatched in a less violent, more intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome its evil predispositions. I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: You assume my people are evil, yet your research is built on sheer superstition.\nHavkelaag: Enough of your kind have wreaked destruction on this plane for me to be confident in my assertion. When I have a suitable sample for my study, I will, however, prove that the effects of their biological inclination are reversible. Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue. Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: So you're planning to torture a child for a year?\nHavkelaag: The child will be a better individual after my treatment than it ever would have been had it been raised in its natural environment. Any suffering it endures will therefore be worth it, for the child, perhaps for the whole of civilised society. My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: No benefit could justify you inflicting such cruelty.\nHavkelaag: Rigorous experimental methods demand we do not indulge our own emotional responses in the application of discomfort to our subjects. Only by the full, uninhibited application of psionic stimuli will we have a true measure of whether the child's innate evil has been cured. Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg?

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon’s voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar. See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy. Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace. Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver. Come. Step forward. You are no sister, but that matters none. Every student is welcome.\nPlayer: What wrong has this man done to deserve such torture?\nMalus Thorm: Behold, sisters, the very face of ignorance - one who mistakes tenderness for torture. Go on. Acquaint the face of ignorance with the true object of our studies.\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly. It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nShadowheart: A stinging truth - but a truth nonetheless.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being? If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: You are well on your way. But one white orb disfigures you still. Let us finish the cure. We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: Their blades are uneven. Efficient surgery will require further training.\nMalus Thorm: Their incisions are, as yet, still streaked with imprecision - that much I must concede. How to steady their hands, I wonder.\nPlayer: Sparring is vital to progress. Have them practice on each other. Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\nMalus Thorm: Yes... For are we not all in need of a cure? The scalpel does not discriminate. Let each and every one of you partake in its soothing journey. Absence, sisters. Acquaint yourselves.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) Screaming and slashing, the sisters brutally murder each other.\nMalus Thorm: It is a proud moment when one sees one's teachings so lovingly taken to heart. You are to be commended for their graduation - rewarded with the promised cure. Come, I will acquaint you with the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nPlayer: You do me an honour, but I am not worthy. Show me the way of Shar - I beg of you. I would rather acquaint myself - if you show me how.\nMalus Thorm: Your diligence is exemplary. Very well: your own scalpel you will be. Observe - then succeed me, into the succour of Shar.",

This woman tended a bar where she took her patrons, her friends, into her confidence - promised their secrets were safe with her. Yet she turned their words into knives - and stabbed them in the back. They died because of her - and to this day her victims lie unavenged.\nPlayer: Her soul has departed for the Fugue Plane, to be judged or lost forever. What more could she pay?\nHe Who Was: The Fugue Plane is no obstacle to one such as I. I seek a record of this one's crimes - written in her own hand. Through it, I can summon her spirit - and force her to face trial for her crimes.\nPlayer: Hardly a fair trial - you've already decided her guilt. Why?\nHe Who Was: Your soul sparks with vengeance. With fury. This is your chance to torment a murderer. To make her suffer. Will you take it?\nPlayer: I will - what must I do?",

We make a good team.\nNightwarden Minthara: My blood ran hot when we broke Ketheric's bones together. But we have greater challenges ahead of us. It is clear, now, that he was not working alone.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Leaves throne, standing from here on\nNightwarden Minthara: We must be free if we are to rule - and to be free, we must destroy this cult, and Ketheric's co-conspirators along with it. I know one of them all too well - Bhaal's blood-letter, Orin. To think I thought her to be speaking for the Absolute. I worshipped that woman.\nPlayer: An old flame?\nNightwarden Minthara: Jealous? You needn't be -  when Orin is in my hands, her agony will nourish me. She is the iblith who indoctrinated me with the Absolute's lies. Indeed, she is the one who indoctrinated me with the Absolute's lies.\nPlayer: What can you tell me about Orin?\nNightwarden Minthara: She is fierce, vicious, and cruel. In those respects, we are alike - but she is dangerously unpredictable. If there is a way to turn this design toward slaughter rather than control, she will take it. She is the one who brought me to Moonrise, and into the presence of her so-called god - the Absolute. Now I know that those memories are lies. There was no god. Orin held me down in a cocoon of flesh, while a mind flayer forced a parasite into my brain. And she laughed at my fear. I will find her, I will murder her. And I will smile.\nPlayer: We'll be heroes - the saviours of Baldur's Gate.\nNightwarden Minthara: Let them think that. There is a short path from saviour to ruler - a short and bloody path. I know it well, and we will walk it together. But Baldur's Gate is a mere bauble. We have the chance to seize something much greater. Surely you see it? In killing Ketheric, we fractured the cult's leadership. When we break the other Chosen and claim their Netherstones, we can take control.\nPlayer: Stealing an entire cult is a new one, even for me.\nNightwarden Minthara: In the long history of these Realms, few people have attempted anything so bold. We may fail, but we must try. The power of the enslaved elder brain could reshape the world. We could reshape the world.\nPlayer: I fear we could lose everything if we try to take control.\nNightwarden Minthara: Nothing worthwhile ever came without loss. But together we have the strength to decide who loses. And to make sure it is not us. You are not stupid. When we reach Baldur's Gate and face the other Chosen, you will see that my way is the right one.\nPlayer: If you go to Baldur's Gate, you're going alone.\nNightwarden Minthara: Without you - without the Prism - I cannot risk going to the city. The Absolute would take my mind again.\nPlayer: You can stay with me if you swear to follow my lead.\nNightwarden Minthara: Fine. All I ask of you is that you keep an open mind. We are bound, then, to travel together, even if we do not yet agree on our ultimate purpose. There is yet one thing about you that troubles me, though. Something I need you to explain. When we killed the tieflings, at the grove, I was not in control of my actions. You do not have that excuse. So I ask you - why? Why kill them?\nPlayer: To watch them suffer - I need no other reason than that.",

Without your help, they would have extracted nothing but screams and blood.\nNarrator: *Her thoughts mingle with yours, a cold hand caressing your brain.*\nNightwarden Minthara: You are a True Soul? Little wonder that you serve me so well. It is time for the raid to begin. The grove, and those who are hiding there, will fall.\nNarrator: *You attune your mind to it. The artefact does not want to part from you. It does not want to fall into the Absolute's clutches.* *Her mind focuses - the cultists cannot discover that the weapon they seek is within their grasp.* *The drow's mind closes around yours, her bloodlust like needles in your skull.*\nPlayer: Even with the grove's numbers depleted, dealing with her there may be safer than fighting here.\nNightwarden Minthara: My patience wears thin, True Soul.

Be my eyes.\nNarrator: *Images of the battle at the gate shimmer into view, along with the adventurers pleading to be let inside.* *Tiefling faces flicker into view as she attempts to learn the grove's location.*\nPlayer: Get out of my mind.\nNightwarden Minthara: Destroying this place is the Absolute's will. Would you defy Her?\nPlayer: Open your mind to her.\nNarrator: *She sees the entrance to the grove as the adventurers retreat inside, joining the tieflings...* *...and then smiles serenely as blood and shadow spread like stains across your memory, erasing all that live there.*\nNightwarden Minthara: The cowards found refuge among the desperate. Perfect. If the inhabitants do not realise you are the knife at their throats, we can use that against them. Go to their refuge and make your way inside. As a friend.\nPlayer: I prefer to face my enemies rather than stabbing them in the back.\nNightwarden Minthara: How noble. I prefer to win. I will gather a raiding party and move into position. You will open the gates from the inside when the time is right to strike. We will cleanse the place of infidels and burn it to the ground in the Absolute's name. And then we will be the first among Her favourites.\nNarrator: *The masterful painting she depicts of the massacre awakens you hungrily.*\nPlayer: I've done enough. The battle is yours to fight.\nNightwarden Minthara: I do not intend to lead a suicidal charge. The goblins are expendable; I am not. The Absolute brought you here for a reason - to throw open those gates so we can crush our enemies.\nPlayer: If I do this, I expect to be rewarded.",

Would you be interested in studying it?\nHavkelaag: A githyanki egg? What a fortuitous turn of events. I've been attempting to get my hands on one for some time now. Would you consider parting with it? The Society's coffers are deep enough to cover any expenses accrued in its retrieval, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: Chk. Don't you dare consider it.\nPlayer: What are you going to do with it?\nHavkelaag: Study it, of course. The githyanki have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months. You yourself have no doubt experienced the prejudice of those who assume that, as beings of the Underdark, we are inherently evil. The githyanki face similar prejudice, but I believe, if hatched in a less violent, more intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome its evil predispositions. I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: So the child inside will be experimented on?\nHavkelaag: Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue. Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: So you're planning to torture a child for a year?\nHavkelaag: The child will be a better individual after my treatment than it ever would have been had it been raised in its natural environment. Any suffering it endures will therefore be worth it, for the child, perhaps for the whole of civilised society. My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: Your findings are irrelevant, as are the opinions of all on this kaincha plane.\nHavkelaag: Ah. A display of the well-known githyanki arrogance. I am not sure my experiment can cure that particular affliction, but give me time and I will find a way. Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg? ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: A gith hatchling is not a lab rat! This shka'keth should be bled dry for the mere suggestion.\nPlayer: Sell the egg.\nHavkelaag: Ah. Unfortunately, it seems I've mislaid my purse. I don't suppose you'd consider simply donating it to the Society instead?\nPlayer: Fine. Here you go.",

I have heard it directly from Queen Vlaakith herself. It is how we will stop the mind flayers before they destroy us all.

Now.\nPlayer: Here's how deals like this work: I have something you need. I can bargain all I like.\nCh'r'ai W'wargaz: I do not know what base, naive entities you have made deals with before - nor do I care. But I will humour your greed for a moment. What would you ask of an Inquisitor? Is that so? Well, then - humour me. What would you ask of an Inquisitor?\nNodeContext: Bemused, snarky\nPlayer: I could use an ally against the illithids.

See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy. Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace. Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver. Come. Step forward. I can see the love of Shar darken your eyes.

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon’s voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar. See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy. Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace. Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver. Come. Step forward. You are no sister, but that matters none. Every student is welcome.\nPlayer: Just kill them already - all this torture is pointless.\nMalus Thorm: Behold, sisters, the very face of ignorance - one who mistakes tenderness for torture. Go on. Acquaint the face of ignorance with the true object of our studies.\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly. It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nShadowheart: A stinging truth - but a truth nonetheless.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being? If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: But you: look how the succour of Shar eludes you. See how painfully present you remain... We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: Their blades are uneven. Efficient surgery will require further training.\nMalus Thorm: Their incisions are, as yet, still streaked with imprecision - that much I must concede. How to steady their hands, I wonder.\nPlayer: Practice - that's how I got good with a blade. They should spar each other. Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\nMalus Thorm: Yes... For are we not all in need of a cure? The scalpel does not discriminate. Let each and every one of you partake in its soothing journey. Absence, sisters. Acquaint yourselves.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) Screaming and slashing, the sisters brutally murder each other.\nMalus Thorm: It is a proud moment when one sees one's teachings so lovingly taken to heart. You are to be commended for their graduation - rewarded with the promised cure. Come, I will acquaint you with the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nPlayer: You do me an honour, but I am not worthy. Show me the way of Shar - I beg of you. I would rather acquaint myself - if you show me how.\nMalus Thorm: Your diligence is exemplary. Very well: your own scalpel you will be. Observe - then succeed me, into the succour of Shar.",

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon’s voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar. See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy. Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace. Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver. Come. Step forward. I can see the love of Shar darken your eyes. Be welcome.\nPlayer: May Shar guide your blessing hands.\nMalus Thorm: And the rough vessels that are yours.

What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being? If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: You are well on your way. But one white orb disfigures you still. Let us finish the cure. We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: The sisters aren't ready. They'll make me sick instead of curing me.\nMalus Thorm: Their incisions are, as yet, still streaked with imprecision - that much I must concede. How to steady their hands, I wonder.\nPlayer: Sparring is vital to progress. Have them practice on each other. Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\nMalus Thorm: Yes...

There are gasps from the crowd, and several of the Harpers move in to strike us down. |\nJaheira: What in the hells is that thing?\nPlayer: Your guess is as good as mine.\nJaheira: Strangest magic I've seen since roaming the ruins of Myth Drannor, but I can't argue with the results. Congratulations. You've earned yourself the benefit of the doubt. Hear me, Harpers!

If we're to survive, we need to trust each other. You seem reliable. I think you know how important it is that we find someone who can cure us. Best if we focus on that. And just to be clear, come daybreak, finding a healer is our first priority.\nPlayer: Let's not abandon all caution. This is unfamiliar territory.",

I take it the breaking of my skeletons was an accident - the living are so clumsy, after all.\nPlayer: I'm pleased to be of service, Balthazar.\nBalthazar: Perhaps you can prove to me that you're more useful alive than dead. You know what's at stake here, I take it? But you're here now, and I may be able to put those limbs to work. You know what's at stake here, I take it?\nPlayer: Nere mentioned that you were seeking access to the Temple. Looks like you found it.\nBalthazar: Perhaps you'd be more useful dead than alive if you don't even know what I'm seeking here. But you're here now, and I may be able to put those limbs to work. You know what's at stake here, I take it?\nPlayer: Z'rell said Ketheric wants you to find a relic. That's all I know. As you mention serving Ketheric, he sent you to find a relic, no?\nBalthazar: General Thorm to you. But yes, recovering the relic is the crux of it. He commands, and I, his humble servant, fulfil that command. While you, an infinitely more humble servant, fulfil my command. I will put you to work - as a scout.\nNarrator: *This necromancer has Ketheric's trust. Helping him might just be the best way to gain access to Moonrise Towers.* *This necromancer has Ketheric's trust. Helping him could be just what you need to gain access to the man himself.*\nPlayer: I need more to go on. Why is this relic so important? What does it do?\nBalthazar: Fine, if it'll spare me your bleating. The relic lends the General his strength, his invulnerability. It must be recovered, before his enemies attempt to exploit it. The Nightsong lends the General his strength, his invulnerability. It must be recovered, before his enemies attempt to exploit it.\nPlayer: Sounds like you've good reason to be proud of the Nightsong - tell me more.\nBalthazar: And spoil the surprise? I think not. But let's just say that the Nightsong was a unique specimen even before I began my work... Words - even my words - are woefully insufficient. When you see for yourself, you will understand.\nPlayer: What do you need me to do?\nBalthazar: I do not need you, or your help. But you are here in spite of that, so I may as well make use of you. The Nightsong is close, but the way is barred and Shar's dead are... uncooperative. Clear the path for me - by blade, cunning, or whatever it takes. I will remain here until you have succeeded, or fallen.\nShadowheart: I'd trust this gasbag about as far as I can throw him - which isn't far. But perhaps better to play along, for now.\nPlayer: For jobs like this it's good form to provide your operatives some extra resources.\nBalthazar: Fine. I will assign Flesh to aid you on your way. Ring this bell... ...and he will come. My brother is no intellectual powerhouse, but he is strong, loyal and punctual. Should a fight turn against you, remember the bell.",

Maybe that's why they picked him. Told him to kneel... They took his eyes first. Then his tongue.\nPlayer: Wandering into the darkness was a stupid idea.\nAlfira: And I regret it with every breath. I had to watch my friends, people who can barely hold a sword, try to fight a pack of murderous zealots. All I could do was run.\nPlayer: Only fools fight an ambush. Better to live and strike another day - preferably to the neck.\nAlfira: That means a lot, coming from you. You always seem to take everything in your stride. How do you do it? How do you keep going?\nPlayer: Danger is my life - there is no greater thrill for me than the hunt.\nAlfira: You're made of sterner stuff than me then. You've done so much for us already, but I have to ask - the others might still be out there. If they're not dead, they're in Moonrise.

A true friend of nature - or perhaps a lunatic. Either way, I owe thanks. I am the druid Halsin.\nPlayer: I spoke to Nettie - she said you could help me with the parasite in my head.\nHalsin: Parasite in your head...? You mean you have one of them?\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Halsin raises a hand to your head, magically connecting with you (no contact). He gives an alarmed look - he knows what’s inside you\nHalsin: Oak Father preserve you, child... You're infected, aren't you? The mind flayers' spawn. But... something's different. You're aware of the monster inside you. You don't bow to the Absolute, like the True Souls do... How is this possible...?\nPlayer: I don't know.\nHalsin: You weren't speaking lightly when you said you needed help. Let me tell you what I know. I've been studying these parasites for a while now. Ever since I discovered these so-called True Souls are infected with them. Someone is using very powerful magic to modify these tadpoles. They are using them to exert control over the infected. I'm sorry to say, I can't undo that magic, which means I can't cure you. But that doesn't mean I can't help. I didn't find what I came here for - a way to remove the tadpoles - but I found the next best thing. I found out where they come from. That must be where these enchantments are placed on them, and it's where you'll find your cure.\nPlayer: Tell me what you've learned about the tadpoles' origins.\nHalsin: I overheard that the cultists are sending all of their captives to Moonrise Towers. Innocents go in, True Souls come out. Given that all of these True Souls are infected, it has to be the source of this magic. If you want to find a cure, you must head there and discover how the tadpoles are being manipulated.\nPlayer: Altered parasites? A cure at Moonrise Towers, maybe? Sounds like guesswork at best.\nHalsin: I'm as certain as I can be. If you have a better alternative, I won't stop you. I can't stop you, in fact. Which brings me to my next problem... I've no right to ask more of you... but if you could help me, I'd be free to join your journey to Moonrise. I cannot allow these butchers to threaten my grove. The natural order must be protected.\nPlayer: Kagha is dead. She was swayed by Shadow Druids. I had no choice.\nHalsin: Kagha... This is my fault - I was her teacher. I will mourn her when I can. But there are other matters to attend to before that. Chaos is welcome, in doses; it helps keep balance. But this is too much - this is unnatural. Help me kill the leaders of this horde, save my grove. Then I will help you.\n Three deaths could win us peace: the drow Minthara, the hobgoblin Dror Ragzlin, and that perversion of a priestess, Gut. They are the ones holding these parasites together. Remove them and nature will cure itself.\nPlayer: You ask too much of me. I can't help you.",

Whatever your business, I'd see to it quickly - the druids are forcing everyone out. This attack will only strengthen their resolve.\nPlayer: Those goblins - have there been many attacks like that?\nZevlor: There have been several attacks by different monsters.

We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: What brought you here?\nZevlor: We're refugees from Elturel - we took shelter here after gnolls attacked us on the road.

You're aware of the monster inside you. You don't bow to the Absolute, like the True Souls do... How is this possible...?\nPlayer: I think this artefact has something to do with it.\nHalsin: Hmmm... that looks very alien. As alien as the mind flayers. They do not belong on this world. You weren't speaking lightly when you said you needed help. Let me tell you what I know. I've been studying these parasites for a while now. Ever since I discovered these so-called True Souls are infected with them. Someone is using very powerful magic to modify these tadpoles. They are using them to exert control over the infected. I'm sorry to say, I can't undo that magic, which means I can't cure you. But that doesn't mean I can't help. I didn't find what I came here for - a way to remove the tadpoles - but I found the next best thing. I found out where they come from. That must be where these enchantments are placed on them, and it's where you'll find your cure.\nPlayer: So all of this was for nothing.\nHalsin: Patience. I can't just snap my fingers... but I know where the solution almost certainly lies. I overheard that the cultists are sending all of their captives to Moonrise Towers. Innocents go in, True Souls come out. Given that all of these True Souls are infected, it has to be the source of this magic. If you want to find a cure, you must head there and discover how the tadpoles are being manipulated.\nPlayer: You seem to know a lot about this. Will you come with me to Moonrise?\nHalsin: I wish I could, but there's still work I've yet to finish - blood I've yet to spill. I've no right to ask more of you... but if you could help me, I'd be free to join your journey to Moonrise. I cannot allow these butchers to threaten my grove. The natural order must be protected.\nPlayer: Kagha was swayed by Shadow Druids. She nearly sealed the grove.\nHalsin: Kagha... I should have suspected she'd take things too far. I'll deal with her when I can. But there are other matters to attend to before that. Chaos is welcome, in doses; it helps keep balance. But this is too much - this is unnatural. Help me kill the leaders of this horde, save my grove. Then I will help you.\n Three deaths could win us peace: the drow Minthara, the hobgoblin Dror Ragzlin, and that perversion of a priestess, Gut. They are the ones holding these parasites together. Remove them and nature will cure itself.\nPlayer: You ask too much of me. I can't help you.",

The surgeon’s voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar. See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy. Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace. Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver. Come. Step forward. You are no sister, but that matters none. Every student is welcome.\nPlayer: You will stop this sick spectacle at once.\nMalus Thorm: Sick. Quite. But on the cusp of a cure:\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly. It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nWyll: Hells. Only a monster would inflict misery and call it medicine.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being? If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: You are well on your way. But one white orb disfigures you still. Let us finish the cure. We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: Their blades are uneven. Efficient surgery will require further training.\nMalus Thorm: Their incisions are, as yet, still streaked with imprecision - that much I must concede. How to steady their hands, I wonder.\nPlayer: Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\nMalus Thorm: Yes... For are we not all in need of a cure? The scalpel does not discriminate. Let each and every one of you partake in its soothing journey. Absence, sisters. Acquaint yourselves.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) Screaming and slashing, the sisters brutally murder each other.\nMalus Thorm: It is a proud moment when one sees one's teachings so lovingly taken to heart. You are to be commended for their graduation - rewarded with the promised cure. Come, I will acquaint you with the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nPlayer: My magic has blinded me - I see now that Shar is the only path. Show me how - I beg of you. I would rather acquaint myself - if you show me how.\nMalus Thorm: Your diligence is exemplary. Very well: your own scalpel you will be. Observe - then succeed me, into the succour of Shar.",

I will retrieve it for him... ...and you will help me. Ignorant you may be, you've shown some prowess in scouting and combat by making it this far. While you, an infinitely more humble servant, fulfil my command. I will put you to work - as a scout.\nNarrator: *This necromancer has Ketheric's trust.

When you see for yourself, you will understand.\nPlayer: What do you need me to do?\nBalthazar: I do not need you, or your help. But you are here in spite of that, so I may as well make use of you. The relic is close, but the way is barred and Shar's dead are... uncooperative. Clear the path for me - by blade, cunning, or whatever it takes. I will remain here until you have succeeded, or fallen.\nShadowheart: I'd trust this gasbag about as far as I can throw him - which isn't far. But perhaps better to play along, for now.\nPlayer: You have resources to spare - give me something to aid my search.\nBalthazar: Fine. I will assign Flesh to aid you on your way. Ring this bell... ...and he will come. My brother is no intellectual powerhouse, but he is strong, loyal and punctual.

You're delicious.\nHalsin: Perhaps you'd care for a little extra company...\nAstarion: Consider yourself invited!

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon’s voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar. See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy. Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace. Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver. Come. Step forward. You are no sister, but that matters none. Every student is welcome.\nPlayer: What wrong has this man done to deserve such torture?\nMalus Thorm: Behold, sisters, the very face of ignorance - one who mistakes tenderness for torture. Go on. Acquaint the face of ignorance with the true object of our studies.\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly. It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nWyll: Hells. Only a monster would inflict misery and call it medicine.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being? If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: But you: look how the succour of Shar eludes you. See how painfully present you remain... We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: Their blades are uneven. Efficient surgery will require further training.\nMalus Thorm: Their incisions are, as yet, still streaked with imprecision - that much I must concede. How to steady their hands, I wonder.\nPlayer: Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\nMalus Thorm: Yes... For are we not all in need of a cure? The scalpel does not discriminate. Let each and every one of you partake in its soothing journey. Absence, sisters. Acquaint yourselves.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) Screaming and slashing, the sisters brutally murder each other.\nMalus Thorm: It is a proud moment when one sees one's teachings so lovingly taken to heart. You are to be commended for their graduation - rewarded with the promised cure. Come, I will acquaint you with the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nPlayer: You do me an honour, but I am not worthy. Show me the way of Shar - I beg of you. I would rather acquaint myself - if you show me how.\nMalus Thorm: Your diligence is exemplary. Very well: your own scalpel you will be. Observe - then succeed me, into the succour of Shar.",

And if I'm not mistaken, you're the Blade of Frontiers.\nPlayer: What is this place?\nZevlor: A druids' grove, dedicated to the Oak Father, Silvanus. You'll find its keepers just as thorny, I fear. Whatever your business, I'd see to it quickly - the druids are forcing everyone out. This attack will only strengthen their resolve.\nPlayer: Those goblins - have there been many attacks like that?\nZevlor: There have been several attacks by different monsters. The druids blame us 'outsiders' for drawing them here. Nobody's welcome anymore. They've started a ritual to cut the grove off from the world outside. We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: What brought you here?\nZevlor: We're refugees from Elturel - we took shelter here after gnolls attacked us on the road. We were bound for Baldur's Gate, and it was too late to turn back. Elturel had no place for tieflings after the Descent.\nKarlach: Gods, these are those tiefs? Their whole city was dragged into Avernus for a while. Zariel was delighted. When they made it back out, I'd hoped they got their happy ending.\nNarrator: *'The Descent' - an infernal conspiracy that had seen the entire city of Elturel briefly dragged to the Hells.*\nPlayer: If your people survived that, they'll survive anything.\nZevlor: So I hoped. But we've lost so many already - and more will die if we're forced out again. We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: What brought you here?\nZevlor: We're refugees from Elturel - we took shelter here after gnolls attacked us on the road. We were bound for Baldur's Gate, and it was too late to turn back. Elturel had no place for tieflings after the Descent.\nNarrator: *You remember it. Elturel and all its citizens were dragged into Avernus - then back out again.*\nPlayer: I was there, you know. I'd hoped you'd had a happy ending.\nZevlor: We got out alive. That's what matters. And you did too, by the looks of things. We'll live to tell another tale, if we can just convince these druids not to turn us out on our backsides. We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: This ritual - is there no way to convince the druids to stop it?\nZevlor: I've tried. Kagha - their new First Druid - won't even see me. You, though... I know it's not your business, but she owes you for saving this place. Perhaps you could persuade her. For more time to prepare, if nothing else.\nPlayer: I'm sorry. I've got my own problems. Enough about the ritual. I have my own problems.",

A little hospitality won't do any harm.\nPlayer: What's in the chest? Your cargo?\nRugan: Aye. The whole reason we're in this mess. Trinkets for some rich tosser in Baldur's Gate. He gets his shiny baubles, we get a handful of Tarenths.\nNarrator: *Tarenths are the currency of the Zhentarim - a network of merchants and mercenaries with few scruples.* *Tarenths are the currency of a merchant network called the Zhentarim. Led by the mysterious Pereghost of Darkhold, their dealings are far from scrupulous.*\nPlayer: Whatever your cargo is, I'll take it as payment.\nRugan: Listen - I'm indebted to you. And that's why I'm giving you a chance to walk away before you get yourself killed. You made short work of the gnolls... reckon you'd make shorter work of me and the boy. But we're not merchants; we're Zhentarim agents. Steal from us, and you'll have a price on your head.\nPlayer: Zhentarim agents guarding a single chest. Curious.\nRugan: If there are valuable goods on the move, The Black Company's always involved. We're the grease that keeps the wheels of commerce turning. And we don't take kindly to people who meddle in our business. This is the point when a clever operator like you accepts my gratitude and walks away.\nPlayer: You'll find I'm very persuasive. We can make much more coin than you would with your employers.\nRugan: I like the way you think. Didn't expect to turn this horrorshow to my advantage... but why not? The chest's all yours. Damn thing's sealed tighter than a Duke's pursestrings, so there's no point in trying to open it. I know a fence in Baldur's Gate who'll take it off your hands. Nobody will be the wiser. Don't try to cut me out of the deal though. The Black Network has eyes and blades everywhere. Crafty swine like you could make a name for yourself in the Zhentarim. Make sure to drop by our hideout. Pass phrase at the door is 'little serpent, long shadow'. I'll tell my associates to expect you.\nPlayer: I already met your friends - we didn't get along too well.\nRugan: And yet here you are. There's not many cause trouble in a Zhent hideout and walk away. I'd rather walk away too. So let's say our goodbyes, and speak no more of it.\nPlayer: You can leave - but your cargo stays.",

The surgeon’s voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar. See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy. Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace. Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver. Come. Step forward. You are no sister, but that matters none. Every student is welcome.\nPlayer: Just kill them already - all this torture is pointless.\nMalus Thorm: Behold, sisters, the very face of ignorance - one who mistakes tenderness for torture. Go on. Acquaint the face of ignorance with the true object of our studies.\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly. It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nGale: Gods, what living nightmare is this?\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being? If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: But you: look how the succour of Shar eludes even you, one who walks faithfully in her shadow. See how painfully present you remain... We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: The goddess has greater plans for me than to submit to your scalpels.\nMalus Thorm: Another absence is your fate? But if you are not here to be cured, how will my sisters learn? Their incisions are, as yet, still streaked with imprecision - that much I must concede. How to steady their hands, I wonder.\nPlayer: Practice - that's how I got good with a blade. They should spar each other. Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\nMalus Thorm: Yes... For are we not all in need of a cure? The scalpel does not discriminate. Let each and every one of you partake in its soothing journey. Absence, sisters. Acquaint yourselves.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) Screaming and slashing, the sisters brutally murder each other.\nMalus Thorm: It is a proud moment when one sees one's teachings so lovingly taken to heart. You are to be commended for their graduation - rewarded with the promised cure. Come, I will acquaint you with the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nPlayer: I would rather acquaint myself - if you show me how.\nMalus Thorm: Your diligence is exemplary. Very well: your own scalpel you will be. Observe - then succeed me, into the succour of Shar.",

One of our most reliable contractors, though unfortunately this particular request was too much even for her. I believe she quite lost her senses over the task. She came here insisting I purchase an owlbear egg from her, of all things. I don't suppose you've stumbled across any githyanki eggs during your travels? The Society will compensate you for any we purchase, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54]) Would you consider parting with it? The Society's coffers are deep enough to cover any expenses accrued in its retrieval, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: Chk. Don't you dare consider it.\nPlayer: What are you going to do with it?\nHavkelaag: Study it, of course. The githyanki have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months. You are no doubt aware that citizens of the Underdark are held in great suspicion by those who live above ground. Many believe us to be 'evil'. The githyanki face similar prejudice, but I believe, if hatched in a less violent, more intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome its evil predispositions. I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: You're letting your personal biases affect your method. Why assume they're evil?\nHavkelaag: I assume nothing. Innate githyanki cruelty is an established fact - no doubt you witnessed it yourself in the retrieval of the egg itself. When I have a suitable sample for my study, I will, however, prove that the effects of their biological inclination are reversible. Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue. Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: This experiment is exactly the kind of evil you're trying to disprove.\nHavkelaag: The pursuit of knowledge is neither evil nor good. Only in the application of such knowledge should one take on any moral imperative. My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: And what if your experiment fails?\nHavkelaag: If the child remains evil after the experiment is concluded, it will be destroyed. Such is the fate of all used specimens. Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg? ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: A gith hatchling is not a lab rat! This shka'keth should be bled dry for the mere suggestion.\nPlayer: Sell the egg.\nHavkelaag: Ah. Unfortunately, it seems I've mislaid my purse. I don't suppose you'd consider simply donating it to the Society instead?\nPlayer: Fine. Here you go.",

They're the ones that saved us!\nJaheira: They're the one who protected the Emerald Grove?\nMol: Yup. Didn't leave a goblin standing. Not so bad to hang around with either. Plucked one of my friends out of a harpy's talons. Knows when to be discreet, too. I'd pretty much trust them with my life.\nJaheira: A True Soul with a mind of their own... How is that possible? How is that possible?\nPlayer: The Weave itself burns through my veins - perhaps the tadpole is afraid.\nJaheira: I've met no sorcerer that powerful - and I've met many. Now, speak plain - how do you have control? You sound so confident for someone who's so wrong.\nPlayer: I routed your spy, didn't I? I know it's hard to trust anyone right now, but believe me: I am not an Absolute cultist.\nJaheira: Congratulations. You've earned yourself the benefit of the doubt. Hear me, Harpers! All clear, at ease!\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: | (CINE) Those Harpers who still had their weapons drawn stow them way. The tension among them dissipates now that Jaheira has cleared us. |\nJaheira: I'll not pretend to understand what that artefact is, but I'm old and wise enough to recognise a sliver of hope when it crawls out of the dark.

    "conversation": "Havkelaag: Tell me, what can the Society do for you?\nPlayer: I met an expeditioner claiming to work for you. She sought a githyanki egg.\nHavkelaag: Yes, dear Lady Esther. One of our most reliable contractors, though unfortunately this particular request was too much even for her. I believe she quite lost her senses over the task. She came here insisting I purchase an owlbear egg from her, of all things. I don't suppose you've stumbled across any githyanki eggs during your travels? The Society will compensate you for any we purchase, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54]) Would you consider parting with it? The Society's coffers are deep enough to cover any expenses accrued in its retrieval, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: Chk. Don't you dare consider it.\nPlayer: What are you going to do with it?\nHavkelaag: Study it, of course. The githyanki have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months. You are no doubt aware that citizens of the Underdark are held in great suspicion by those who live above ground. Many believe us to be 'evil'. The githyanki face similar prejudice, but I believe, if hatched in a less violent, more intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome its evil predispositions. I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: You assume my people are evil, yet your research is built on sheer superstition.\nHavkelaag: Enough of your kind have wreaked destruction on this plane for me to be confident in my assertion. When I have a suitable sample for my study, I will, however, prove that the effects of their biological inclination are reversible. Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue. Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: You would teach the child virtue, but rear it without patience. Curious.\nHavkelaag: Tell me, then, philosopher - if patience delays the fostering of the other virtues, can it be rightly called virtuous?\nPlayer: By your words, any virtue delaying patience would itself be unvirtuous.\nHavkelaag: And therein lies your fault: you would have us argue in circles until the egg hatches naturally. Time we do not have. My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: No benefit could justify you inflicting such cruelty.\nHavkelaag: Rigorous experimental methods demand we do not indulge our own emotional responses in the application of discomfort to our subjects. Only by the full, uninhibited application of psionic stimuli will we have a true measure of whether the child's innate evil has been cured. Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg? ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: A gith hatchling is not a lab rat! This shka'keth should be bled dry for the mere suggestion.\nPlayer: Sell the egg.",

You made short work of the gnolls... reckon you'd make shorter work of me and the boy. But we're not merchants; we're Zhentarim agents. Steal from us, and you'll have a price on your head.\nPlayer: If your bosses come after the chest, I'll kill them as well.\nRugan: Tougher bastards than you have tried.

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon’s voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar. See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy. Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace. Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver. Come. Step forward. I can see the love of Shar darken your eyes. Be welcome.\nPlayer: What lesson are you teaching these sisters?\nMalus Thorm: The crux of our worship. Tell me, what is the guiding principle of the goddess?\nPlayer: Loss.\nMalus Thorm: I profess there is another more profound.\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly. It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nGale: Gods, what living nightmare is this?\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being? If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: You are well on your way. But one white orb disfigures you still. Let us finish the cure. We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: Their blades are uneven. Efficient surgery will require further training.\nMalus Thorm: Their incisions are, as yet, still streaked with imprecision - that much I must concede. How to steady their hands, I wonder.\nPlayer: Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\nMalus Thorm: Yes... For are we not all in need of a cure? The scalpel does not discriminate. Let each and every one of you partake in its soothing journey. Absence, sisters. Acquaint yourselves.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) Screaming and slashing, the sisters brutally murder each other.\nMalus Thorm: It is a proud moment when one sees one's teachings so lovingly taken to heart. You are to be commended for their graduation - rewarded with the promised cure. Come, I will acquaint you with the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nPlayer: My magic has blinded me - I see now that Shar is the only path. Show me how - I beg of you. I would rather acquaint myself - if you show me how.\nMalus Thorm: Your diligence is exemplary. Very well: your own scalpel you will be. Observe - then succeed me, into the succour of Shar.",

Not that I ever intend to do something as gauche as truly dying, of course. Now, given your prying nature, I have work for you, as a scout. The Nightsong lends the General his strength, his invulnerability. It must be recovered, before his enemies attempt to exploit it.\nPlayer: Sounds like you've good reason to be proud of the Nightsong - tell me more.\nBalthazar: And spoil the surprise? I think not. But let's just say that the Nightsong was a unique specimen even before I began my work... Words - even my words - are woefully insufficient. When you see for yourself, you will understand.\nPlayer: What do you need me to do?\nBalthazar: I do not need you, or your help. But you are here in spite of that, so I may as well make use of you. The Nightsong is close, but the way is barred and Shar's dead are... uncooperative. Clear the path for me - by blade, cunning, or whatever it takes. I will remain here until you have succeeded, or fallen.\nShadowheart: I'd trust this gasbag about as far as I can throw him - which isn't far. But perhaps better to play along, for now.\nPlayer: You have resources to spare - give me something to aid my search.\nBalthazar: Fine. I will assign Flesh to aid you on your way.

One of our most reliable contractors, though unfortunately this particular request was too much even for her. I believe she quite lost her senses over the task. She came here insisting I purchase an owlbear egg from her, of all things. I don't suppose you've stumbled across any githyanki eggs during your travels? The Society will compensate you for any we purchase, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54]) Would you consider parting with it? The Society's coffers are deep enough to cover any expenses accrued in its retrieval, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: Chk. Don't you dare consider it.\nPlayer: What are you going to do with it?\nHavkelaag: Study it, of course. The githyanki have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months. You yourself have no doubt experienced the prejudice of those who assume that, as beings of the Underdark, we are inherently evil. The githyanki face similar prejudice, but I believe, if hatched in a less violent, more intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome its evil predispositions. I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: You assume my people are evil, yet your research is built on sheer superstition.\nHavkelaag: Enough of your kind have wreaked destruction on this plane for me to be confident in my assertion. When I have a suitable sample for my study, I will, however, prove that the effects of their biological inclination are reversible. Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue. Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: So you're planning to torture a child for a year?\nHavkelaag: The child will be a better individual after my treatment than it ever would have been had it been raised in its natural environment. Any suffering it endures will therefore be worth it, for the child, perhaps for the whole of civilised society. My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: Your findings are irrelevant, as are the opinions of all on this kaincha plane.\nHavkelaag: Ah. A display of the well-known githyanki arrogance. I am not sure my experiment can cure that particular affliction, but give me time and I will find a way. Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg? ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: A gith hatchling is not a lab rat! This shka'keth should be bled dry for the mere suggestion.\nPlayer: Sell the egg.\nHavkelaag: Ah. Unfortunately, it seems I've mislaid my purse. I don't suppose you'd consider simply donating it to the Society instead?\nPlayer: Fine. Here you go.",

See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy. Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace. Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver. Come. Step forward. You are no sister, but that matters none. Every student is welcome.\nPlayer: In my experience, torture is usually more pain and less proselytising.\nMalus Thorm: Behold, sisters, the very face of ignorance - one who mistakes tenderness for torture.

It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nWyll: Hells. Only a monster would inflict misery and call it medicine.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being? If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: You are well on your way. But one white orb disfigures you still. Let us finish the cure. We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: Your subject is tainted.

How do you do it? How do you keep going?\nPlayer: Just take it one step at a time.\nAlfira: You make it sound so easy - but I'll try. You've done so much for us already, but I have to ask - the others might still be out there. If they're not dead, they're in Moonrise.

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon’s voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar. See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy. Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace. Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver. Come. Step forward. You are no sister, but that matters none. Every student is welcome.\nPlayer: You will stop this sick spectacle at once.\nMalus Thorm: Sick. Quite. But on the cusp of a cure:\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly. It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nLae'zel: Only a beast of a man toys with his victim. Entertaining, if not efficient.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being? If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: You are well on your way. But one white orb disfigures you still. Let us finish the cure. We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: The sisters aren't ready. They'll make me sick instead of curing me.\nMalus Thorm: Their incisions are, as yet, still streaked with imprecision - that much I must concede. How to steady their hands, I wonder.\nPlayer: 'Only with sacrifice is mastery gained.' For the sisters to learn, you must submit.\nMalus Thorm: Yes. Submit I must, into the Lady's dark-fingered embrace. I see now. By example I must edify and quell the light that blinds us.",

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon’s voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar. See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy. Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace. Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver. Come. Step forward. You are no sister, but that matters none. Every student is welcome.\nPlayer: I am a scholar, this is true - just not in the study of torture.\nMalus Thorm: Behold, sisters, the very face of ignorance - one who mistakes tenderness for torture. Go on. Acquaint the face of ignorance with the true object of our studies.\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly. It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nGale: Gods, what living nightmare is this?\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being? If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: You are well on your way. But one white orb disfigures you still. Let us finish the cure. We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: The goddess has greater plans for me than to submit to your scalpels.\nMalus Thorm: Another absence is your fate? But if you are not here to be cured, how will my sisters learn? Their incisions are, as yet, still streaked with imprecision - that much I must concede. How to steady their hands, I wonder.\nPlayer: Practice - that's how I got good with a blade. They should spar each other. Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\nMalus Thorm: Yes... For are we not all in need of a cure? The scalpel does not discriminate. Let each and every one of you partake in its soothing journey. Absence, sisters. Acquaint yourselves.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) Screaming and slashing, the sisters brutally murder each other.\nMalus Thorm: It is a proud moment when one sees one's teachings so lovingly taken to heart. You are to be commended for their graduation - rewarded with the promised cure. Come, I will acquaint you with the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nPlayer: My magic has blinded me - I see now that Shar is the only path. Show me how - I beg of you. I would rather acquaint myself - if you show me how.\nMalus Thorm: Your diligence is exemplary. Very well: your own scalpel you will be. Observe - then succeed me, into the succour of Shar.",

May I trust you'll see it through?\nPlayer: The Absolute's cult is based at Moonrise Towers. That's where they'll have taken the duke.\nCounsellor Florrick: Moonrise Towers? Along the old road? That place is cursed. Few could survive there... ... unless darker forces are at work. This was no random attack.

Congratulations. You've earned yourself the benefit of the doubt. Hear me, Harpers! All clear, at ease!\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: | (CINE) Those Harpers who still had their weapons drawn stow them way. The tension among them dissipates now that Jaheira has cleared us. |\nJaheira: I'll not pretend to understand what that artefact is, but I'm old and wise enough to recognise a sliver of hope when it crawls out of the dark.

Raphael made double-sure of that: I can't forget the damned thing so long as my work's not finished. I did as instructed, but the song still rattles about in my head - the contract still stands, somehow. If I break it, I will become Raphael's slave forever. Anyway, enough prattle.

    "conversation": "Raphael: Do you know what happens when a devil is struck down on this charming plane of existence? It returns to the hells - to the very point where it last stood before venturing to whichever devilforsaken plane it died on. In the case of our friend Yurgir, the orthon you so handily dispatched in the temple of Shar, he manifested in my House of Hope. He returned to me chastened but intact, his wounds healed, his body restored. He thought I would dismember him but he has his uses so instead I am reeducating him.\nAstarion: We delivered the devil. Now I want what I'm owed - we had a deal.\nRaphael: Indeed we did. I discovered all there is to know about those scars of yours - it's a rather grim tale, even for my tastes.\nPlayer: We had a deal - the orthon for information.\nRaphael: Indeed we did.

I discovered all there is to know about those scars of yours - it's a rather grim tale, even for my tastes.\nPlayer: Stop stalling.\nRaphael: As you wish. Brace yourself, Astarion - we're about to unveil your destiny. And why would he want to walk away? This is his destiny. As you know already, your precious skin is home to one part of a contract between the archdevil Mephistopheles, and your former master, Cazador Szarr. In full, the contract states that Cazador will be granted knowledge of an infernal ritual so vile it has never been performed. The Rite of Profane Ascension. It promises to be a marvellous ceremony. Very elaborate, incredibly ancient, and entirely diabolical. If he completes the rite, he will become a new kind of being - the Vampire Ascendant. All the strengths of his vampiric form will be amplified, and alongside them he will enjoy the luxuries of the living. The arousals and appetites of man will return to him, and unlike you, he will have no need of a parasite to protect him from the sun. But the ritual has its price, as all worthwhile things do. Lord Cazador will need to sacrifice a number of souls, including all of his vampiric spawn, if he is to ascend. Imagine how he felt, then, when one of those precious spawn simply disappeared into thin air. The only missing ingredient is Astarion. You are the final piece he requires to complete the ritual - your scars bind you to it. Your soul will set off a very wave of death, bringing Cazador his twisted life. And that, my tragic and toothsome friend, is that. Now if you'll excuse me, I have business elsewhere.\nNodeContext: [Tarik] snaps fingers at the end of the line.\nAstarion: Hmm...\nPlayer: Cazador is a piece of shit. We're going to stop him.\nAstarion: Do you think it's so simple? What do you think I should do?\nPlayer: We can't let Cazador complete that ritual. He could unleash terrible horrors.\nAstarion: The end of my life among them. Just when I was starting to enjoy it. He'll never leave me alone. I didn't think he would when I was just one more wretched toy for him to play with. But if I'm the key to this power he craves, he'll hunt me to the ends of Faerûn. I need to take the fight to him. And I need you to help me.\nPlayer: Of course I'll help. We'll hunt him down and kill him.",

I'm more than happy to make you one, if you'd honour me with your blood. With one drop, I can brew a rather potent potion for you. The rest, I keep for myself.\nPlayer: No, I'm not interested.\nAraj Oblodra: I'm here should you change your mind. There we are. All of your very best traits in a bottle. Use it well! Although perhaps there's one more thing we could discuss: your vampiric friend.\nAstarion: Don't worry, we're all friends under the Absolute. I won't bite.\nAraj Oblodra: Oh I'd prefer if you did. I assume he belongs to you?\nPlayer: We travel together - that's all.\nAraj Oblodra: Ah, it's like that. Do you have a name, spawn?\nAstarion: Astarion, but hold on-\nAraj Oblodra: Good. Now, Astarion, I've dreamt of being bitten by a vampire since I was a young girl.\nAstarion: I'm sorry? You want to be bitten?\nAraj Oblodra: To feel your life's blood slipping away? To dance on the edge between life and death? Yes, I want it. I'll even compensate you - a potion of legendary power that forever increases the strength of the one who consumes it. It's not for sale, but it's yours if you bite me.\nAstarion: I will have to decline.\nAraj Oblodra: Excuse me? This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and you're squandering it.\nAstarion: I gave you my answer.\nAraj Oblodra: Can't you talk some sense into your obstinate charge?\nPlayer: Just bite her - the potion sounds useful.\nAstarion: I'm sorry, but could you excuse us a moment? Are you actually asking me to do this? Trading me for some potion? Because there's something wrong with her blood. I can smell it from here - it's rank.\nPlayer: Her house, Oblodra, was infamous for experimenting with mind flayers. Could her blood be tainted somehow?\nAstarion: That would explain the stench, yes. I already have enough illithid filth in my head - I don't want it in my stomach as well.\nAraj Oblodra: I don't have all day, True Soul.\nPlayer: Don't do anything you don't want to.\nAstarion: All right.

I discovered all there is to know about those scars of yours - it's a rather grim tale, even for my tastes.\nPlayer: Are you sure you want to know, Astarion? Maybe it's best left in the past.\nAstarion: Even if I wanted to walk away from all of this, I can't. Cazador won't let me.\nRaphael: And why would he want to walk away? This is his destiny. As you know already, your precious skin is home to one part of a contract between the archdevil Mephistopheles, and your former master, Cazador Szarr. In full, the contract states that Cazador will be granted knowledge of an infernal ritual so vile it has never been performed. The Rite of Profane Ascension. It promises to be a marvellous ceremony. Very elaborate, incredibly ancient, and entirely diabolical. If he completes the rite, he will become a new kind of being - the Vampire Ascendant. All the strengths of his vampiric form will be amplified, and alongside them he will enjoy the luxuries of the living. The arousals and appetites of man will return to him, and unlike you, he will have no need of a parasite to protect him from the sun. But the ritual has its price, as all worthwhile things do. Lord Cazador will need to sacrifice a number of souls, including all of his vampiric spawn, if he is to ascend. Imagine how he felt, then, when one of those precious spawn simply disappeared into thin air. The only missing ingredient is Astarion. You are the final piece he requires to complete the ritual - your scars bind you to it. Your soul will set off a very wave of death, bringing Cazador his twisted life. And that, my tragic and toothsome friend, is that. Now if you'll excuse me, I have business elsewhere.\nNodeContext: [Tarik] snaps fingers at the end of the line.\nAstarion: Hmm...\nPlayer: 'Hmm'? That's all you have to say?\nAstarion: I was... contemplating. It's a lot to take in. What do you think I should do?\nPlayer: There's a way to become a living vampire... That must mean a lot to you.\nAstarion: The idea definitely has appeal. I could get rid of the worm in my head and still walk in the sun. I'd finally be free of the hunger. And if I'm the key to this deal of Cazador's, perhaps I can turn this to my advantage... I need to take the fight to him. And I need you to help me.\nPlayer: Of course I'll help. We'll hunt him down and kill him.",

I discovered all there is to know about those scars of yours - it's a rather grim tale, even for my tastes.\nPlayer: Please, give me more boring details about your plans.\nRaphael: Come now, we're about to unveil your destiny - you should be quivering in anticipation.\n And why would he want to walk away? This is his destiny. As you know already, your precious skin is home to one part of a contract between the archdevil Mephistopheles, and your former master, Cazador Szarr. In full, the contract states that Cazador will be granted knowledge of an infernal ritual so vile it has never been performed. The Rite of Profane Ascension. It promises to be a marvellous ceremony. Very elaborate, incredibly ancient, and entirely diabolical. If he completes the rite, he will become a new kind of being - the Vampire Ascendant. All the strengths of his vampiric form will be amplified, and alongside them he will enjoy the luxuries of the living. The arousals and appetites of man will return to him, and unlike Astarion, he will have no need of a parasite to protect him from the sun. But the ritual has its price, as all worthwhile things do. Lord Cazador will need to sacrifice a number of souls, including all of his vampiric spawn, if he is to ascend. Imagine how he felt, then, when one of those precious spawn simply disappeared into thin air. The only missing ingredient is Astarion. You are the final piece he requires to complete the ritual - your scars bind you to it. Your soul will set off a very wave of death, bringing Cazador his twisted life. And that, my tragic and toothsome friend, is that. Now if you'll excuse me, I have business elsewhere.\nNodeContext: [Tarik] snaps fingers at the end of the line.\nAstarion: Hmm...\nPlayer: 'Hmm'? That's all you have to say?\nAstarion: I was... contemplating. It's a lot to take in. What do you think I should do?\nPlayer: I think you should run. If Cazador can't find you, he can't complete his ritual.\n\nAstarion: How long do you think I can run? He has eternity to find me. He'll never leave me alone. I didn't think he would when I was just one more wretched toy for him to play with. But if I'm the key to this power he craves, he'll hunt me to the ends of Faerûn. I need to take the fight to him. And I need you to help me.\nPlayer: Of course I'll help. We'll hunt him down and kill him.",

I know one of them all too well - Bhaal's blood-letter, Orin. To think I thought her to be speaking for the Absolute. I worshipped that woman.\nPlayer: An old flame?\nNightwarden Minthara: Jealous? You needn't be -  when Orin is in my hands, her agony will nourish me. She is the iblith who indoctrinated me with the Absolute's lies. Indeed, she is the one who indoctrinated me with the Absolute's lies.\nPlayer: What can you tell me about Orin?\nNightwarden Minthara: She is fierce, vicious, and cruel. In those respects, we are alike - but she is dangerously unpredictable. If there is a way to turn this design toward slaughter rather than control, she will take it. She is the one who brought me to Moonrise, and into the presence of her so-called god - the Absolute. Now I know that those memories are lies. There was no god. Orin held me down in a cocoon of flesh, while a mind flayer forced a parasite into my brain. And she laughed at my fear. I will find her, I will murder her. And I will smile.\nPlayer: Once she's dead, the cult will need new leadership - perhaps we can take her place.\nNightwarden Minthara: It is as if you read my mind. Perhaps you did.\nPlayer: Tempting, but eradicating the brain may be wiser, to put an end to this madness.\nNightwarden Minthara: Madness would be to let the Absolute's potential go to waste. The power of the enslaved elder brain could reshape the world. We could reshape the world.\nPlayer: It's going to be glorious - I can hardly wait.",

He returned to me chastened but intact, his wounds healed, his body restored. He thought I would dismember him but he has his uses so instead I am reeducating him.\nAstarion: We delivered the devil. Now I want what I'm owed - we had a deal.\nRaphael: Indeed we did. I discovered all there is to know about those scars of yours - it's a rather grim tale, even for my tastes.\nPlayer: We had a deal - the orthon for information.\nRaphael: Indeed we did. I discovered all there is to know about those scars of yours - it's a rather grim tale, even for my tastes.\nPlayer: Are you sure you want to know, Astarion? Maybe it's best left in the past.\nAstarion: Even if I wanted to walk away from all of this, I can't. Cazador won't let me.\nRaphael: And why would he want to walk away? This is his destiny. As you know already, your precious skin is home to one part of a contract between the archdevil Mephistopheles, and your former master, Cazador Szarr. In full, the contract states that Cazador will be granted knowledge of an infernal ritual so vile it has never been performed. The Rite of Profane Ascension. It promises to be a marvellous ceremony. Very elaborate, incredibly ancient, and entirely diabolical. If he completes the rite, he will become a new kind of being - the Vampire Ascendant. All the strengths of his vampiric form will be amplified, and alongside them he will enjoy the luxuries of the living. The arousals and appetites of man will return to him, and unlike Astarion, he will have no need of a parasite to protect him from the sun. But the ritual has its price, as all worthwhile things do. Lord Cazador will need to sacrifice a number of souls, including all of his vampiric spawn, if he is to ascend. Imagine how he felt, then, when one of those precious spawn simply disappeared into thin air. The only missing ingredient is Astarion. You are the final piece he requires to complete the ritual - your scars bind you to it. Your soul will set off a very wave of death, bringing Cazador his twisted life. And that, my tragic and toothsome friend, is that. Now if you'll excuse me, I have business elsewhere.\nNodeContext: [Tarik] snaps fingers at the end of the line.\nAstarion: Hmm...\nPlayer: You're... quiet. It's unsettling.\nAstarion: It's a lot to take in. What do you think I should do?\nPlayer: You'll never be free while Cazador lives.\nAstarion: I hate how right you are. I knew he wouldn't leave me alone even when I was just another wretched toy for him to play with. But if I'm the key to this power he craves, he'll hunt me to the ends of Faerûn.

    "conversation": "Raphael: Do you know what happens when a devil is struck down on this charming plane of existence? It returns to the hells - to the very point where it last stood before venturing to whichever devilforsaken plane it died on. In the case of our friend Yurgir, the orthon you so handily dispatched in the temple of Shar, he manifested in my House of Hope. He returned to me chastened but intact, his wounds healed, his body restored. He thought I would dismember him but he has his uses so instead I am reeducating him.\nAstarion: We delivered the devil. Now I want what I'm owed - we had a deal.\nRaphael: Indeed we did. I discovered all there is to know about those scars of yours - it's a rather grim tale, even for my tastes.\nPlayer: Spill it - this sounds fascinating.\nAstarion: I'd appreciate a little less enthusiasm when it comes to Cazador and his horrors.\nRaphael: Oh come, Astarion. We're about to unveil your destiny - you should be quivering in anticipation. Carved into that ivory skin of yours is one part of an infernal contract between the archdevil Mephistopheles and your former master, Cazador Szarr. In full, the contract states that Cazador will be granted knowledge of an infernal ritual so vile it has never been performed. The Rite of Profane Ascension. It promises to be a marvellous ceremony. Very elaborate, incredibly ancient, and entirely diabolical. If he completes the rite, he will become a new kind of being - the Vampire Ascendant. All the strengths of his vampiric form will be amplified, and alongside them he will enjoy the luxuries of the living. The arousals and appetites of man will return to him, and unlike you, he will have no need of a parasite to protect him from the sun. But the ritual has its price, as all worthwhile things do. Lord Cazador will need to sacrifice a number of souls, including all of his vampiric spawn, if he is to ascend. Imagine how he felt, then, when one of those precious spawn simply disappeared into thin air. The only missing ingredient is Astarion. You are the final piece he requires to complete the ritual - your scars bind you to it. Your soul will set off a very wave of death, bringing Cazador his twisted life. And that, my tragic and toothsome friend, is that. Now if you'll excuse me, I have business elsewhere.\nNodeContext: [Tarik] snaps fingers at the end of the line.\nAstarion: Hmm...\nPlayer: You're... quiet. It's unsettling.\nAstarion: It's a lot to take in. What do you think I should do?\nPlayer: I think you should run. If Cazador can't find you, he can't complete his ritual.\n\nAstarion: How long do you think I can run? He has eternity to find me. He'll never leave me alone. I didn't think he would when I was just one more wretched toy for him to play with. But if I'm the key to this power he craves, he'll hunt me to the ends of Faerûn. I need to take the fight to him. And I need you to help me.\nPlayer: If he comes for you, I'll defend you. But we're not risking an attack on his lair.\nAstarion: If you won't risk taking him on for my sake, think of the innocent souls he'll sacrifice in this ritual.\nPlayer: You're right - I'll help you destroy him.",

Knives, poison, strangulation - whatever you'd prefer.\nPlayer: Killing me would rather decrease your odds of survival. Dramatically, in fact.\nAstarion: Don't be so pig-headed, I'm being practical.

A bite from them and you might wake up as a vampire spawn, like my good self. All of a vampire's hunger, but few of their powers. Of course, I can't summon wolves or turn to mist like a 'true' vampire. Being a spawn has its drawbacks.\nPlayer: Is that how you can stand in the sun? Because you're not a 'true' vampire?\nAstarion: Oh no, I should be cinders in this light. I hadn't seen the sun for two hundred years before we crashed here. Someone - or something - wants me alive. They've changed the rules. Standing in the sun, wading through a river, wandering into homes without an invitation - they're all perfectly mundane activities now. As for my other quirks - well, we can figure those out in time.\nPlayer: If I can help, just ask. We're in this together.\nAstarion: Oh you're such a sweetheart.

Although perhaps there's one more thing we could discuss: your vampiric friend.\nAstarion: Don't worry, we're all friends under the Absolute. I won't bite.\nAraj Oblodra: Oh I'd prefer if you did. I assume he belongs to you?\nPlayer: Excuse me? He's his own person.\nAraj Oblodra: I'm sure he really believes that. How utterly adorable. Do you have a name, spawn?\nAstarion: Astarion, but hold on-\nAraj Oblodra: Good. Now, Astarion, I've dreamt of being bitten by a vampire since I was a young girl.\nAstarion: I'm sorry? You want to be bitten?\nAraj Oblodra: To feel your life's blood slipping away? To dance on the edge between life and death? Yes, I want it. I'll even compensate you - a potion of legendary power that forever increases the strength of the one who consumes it. It's not for sale, but it's yours if you bite me.\nAstarion: I will have to decline.\nAraj Oblodra: Excuse me? This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and you're squandering it.\nAstarion: I gave you my answer.\nAraj Oblodra: Can't you talk some sense into your obstinate charge?\nPlayer: Just bite her - the potion sounds useful.\nAstarion: I'm sorry, but could you excuse us a moment? Are you actually asking me to do this? Trading me for some potion? Because there's something wrong with her blood. I can smell it from here - it's rank.\nPlayer: Her house, Oblodra, was infamous for experimenting with mind flayers. Could her blood be tainted somehow?\nAstarion: That would explain the stench, yes. I already have enough illithid filth in my head - I don't want it in my stomach as well.\nAraj Oblodra: I don't have all day, True Soul.\nPlayer: Don't do anything you don't want to.\nAstarion: All right. Thank you. It's still a no, I'm afraid.",

In the case of our friend Yurgir, the orthon you so handily dispatched in the temple of Shar, he manifested in my House of Hope. He returned to me chastened but intact, his wounds healed, his body restored. He thought I would dismember him but he has his uses so instead I am reeducating him.\nAstarion: We delivered the devil. Now I want what I'm owed - we had a deal.\nRaphael: Indeed we did. I discovered all there is to know about those scars of yours - it's a rather grim tale, even for my tastes.\nPlayer: We had a deal - the orthon for information.\nRaphael: Indeed we did.

I discovered all there is to know about those scars of yours - it's a rather grim tale, even for my tastes.\nPlayer: Please, give me more boring details about your plans.\nRaphael: Come now, we're about to unveil your destiny - you should be quivering in anticipation.\n And why would he want to walk away? This is his destiny. As you know already, your precious skin is home to one part of a contract between the archdevil Mephistopheles, and your former master, Cazador Szarr. In full, the contract states that Cazador will be granted knowledge of an infernal ritual so vile it has never been performed. The Rite of Profane Ascension. It promises to be a marvellous ceremony. Very elaborate, incredibly ancient, and entirely diabolical. If he completes the rite, he will become a new kind of being - the Vampire Ascendant. All the strengths of his vampiric form will be amplified, and alongside them he will enjoy the luxuries of the living. The arousals and appetites of man will return to him, and unlike Astarion, he will have no need of a parasite to protect him from the sun. But the ritual has its price, as all worthwhile things do. Lord Cazador will need to sacrifice a number of souls, including all of his vampiric spawn, if he is to ascend. Imagine how he felt, then, when one of those precious spawn simply disappeared into thin air. The only missing ingredient is Astarion. You are the final piece he requires to complete the ritual - your scars bind you to it. Your soul will set off a very wave of death, bringing Cazador his twisted life. And that, my tragic and toothsome friend, is that. Now if you'll excuse me, I have business elsewhere.\nNodeContext: [Tarik] snaps fingers at the end of the line.\nAstarion: Hmm...\nPlayer: 'Hmm'? That's all you have to say?\nAstarion: I was... contemplating. It's a lot to take in. What do you think I should do?\nPlayer: We can't let Cazador complete that ritual. He could unleash terrible horrors.\nAstarion: The end of my life among them. Just when I was starting to enjoy it. He'll never leave me alone. I didn't think he would when I was just one more wretched toy for him to play with. But if I'm the key to this power he craves, he'll hunt me to the ends of Faerûn. I need to take the fight to him. And I need you to help me.\nPlayer: Not a chance.\nAstarion: If you won't risk taking him on for my sake, think of the innocent souls he'll sacrifice in this ritual.\nPlayer: You're right - I'll help you destroy him.",

Fresh entertainment. But you're too fresh for this place, aren't you? You've got the stench of the Hells about you - the stench of home. And a whiff of the surface besides. A servant of Zariel, if I'm not mistaken. I'd know the stench of her infernal machinery anywhere. You trying to burrow back home, little rabbit?\nPlayer: What do you know about infernal machinery?\nYurgir: Only what I can smell. And whatever engine burns within you is grinding to an inevitable explosion. Burning and fear - you reek with it. ...There's something else, almost hidden by your fear-stink... cherries, musk... and sulphur.\nNodeContext: Sniffing the air at the start, detecting something - then erupting with fury at the end on 'sulphur'.\nYurgir: Raphael! I can smell him all over you. Where is he?!\nNodeContext: Furious\nPlayer: Wait - you know Raphael?\nYurgir: That perfumed trickster swindled me - trapped me.\nPlayer: He wants you dead.\nYurgir: Where is he? Spit it out - Now.\nAstarion: What are you doing? The devil told us to kill this thing, so let's stop chatting and kill it.\nPlayer: Let's share our experiences about Raphael. Perhaps we can help each other.\nYurgir: Bargaining, are you? A Kara-Tur warlord once tried the same - I made him watch as I ate his concubines and young, then fashioned a codpiece from his skull. Besides, I told you already - I'm bound to this place. You can't help. It's not just walls that keep me here. Not the traps, the dark or the creatures it hides. Something stronger holds me - a contract. Either I fulfil the contract, die trying... or forfeit my freedom. If I leave this place now, I'll become Raphael's slave.\nPlayer: You're hardly free as it is, trapped here. Maybe you're better off indebted to Raphael.\nYurgir: You wouldn't say that if you truly knew his mind. Just listen to the terms he gave me. Spill all the blood sworn to the night.\nSilence all prayers; smother each rite.\nNodeContext: singing, a cappella\nYurgir: Wander Shar's halls; hungry to slay;\nLeave no Justiciar alive to obey.\nNodeContext: singing, a cappella\nYurgir: Leave none to hear it, then be set free;\nThis song is your oath, swear, swear it to me.\nNodeContext: singing, a cappella\nNarrator: *Well, that explains where all the Dark Justiciars went.*\nYurgir: ...That's it.\nNodeContext: A little knowing (double meaning in 'that's it' - the song has ended, but he also thinks he's stumbled upon a revelation in the lyrics.)\nAstarion: Pretty tune for a contract that says 'kill all Justiciars'.\nPlayer: Raphael wanted you to kill Dark Justiciars? Why?\nYurgir: Asking why doesn't get me paid - hunting and killing does. Raphael mentioned something about an aasimar. Meant nothing to me.\nNodeContext: Pronounced AH-sim-ar.\nYurgir: I did my part - I filled these halls with ghosts. But Raphael's playing some other game - one that involves stiffing me. Anyway, enough prattle. The lyrics are clear - all who hear the song must die.\nNodeContext: Brutally matter-of-fact\nYurgir: Time to die.\nNarrator: *You feel your patron's prickling flame at the back of your mind - and its diabolic words on your tongue.

But let me go, and I'll free you from his grasp.\nYurgir: Bargaining, are you? A Kara-Tur warlord once tried the same - I made him watch as I ate his concubines and young, then fashioned a codpiece from his skull. You can't help. It's not just walls that keep me here. Not the traps, the dark or the creatures it hides. Something stronger holds me - a contract. Either I fulfil the contract, die trying... or forfeit my freedom.

    "conversation": "Raphael: Do you know what happens when a devil is struck down on this charming plane of existence? It returns to the hells - to the very point where it last stood before venturing to whichever devilforsaken plane it died on. In the case of our friend Yurgir, the orthon you so handily dispatched in the temple of Shar, he manifested in my House of Hope. He returned to me chastened but intact, his wounds healed, his body restored. He thought I would dismember him but he has his uses so instead I am reeducating him.\nAstarion: We delivered the devil. Now I want what I'm owed - we had a deal.\nRaphael: Indeed we did. I discovered all there is to know about those scars of yours - it's a rather grim tale, even for my tastes.\nPlayer: Please, give me more boring details about your plans.\nRaphael: Come now, we're about to unveil your destiny - you should be quivering in anticipation.\n And why would he want to walk away? This is his destiny. As you know already, your precious skin is home to one part of a contract between the archdevil Mephistopheles, and your former master, Cazador Szarr. In full, the contract states that Cazador will be granted knowledge of an infernal ritual so vile it has never been performed. The Rite of Profane Ascension. It promises to be a marvellous ceremony. Very elaborate, incredibly ancient, and entirely diabolical. If he completes the rite, he will become a new kind of being - the Vampire Ascendant. All the strengths of his vampiric form will be amplified, and alongside them he will enjoy the luxuries of the living. The arousals and appetites of man will return to him, and unlike Astarion, he will have no need of a parasite to protect him from the sun. But the ritual has its price, as all worthwhile things do. Lord Cazador will need to sacrifice a number of souls, including all of his vampiric spawn, if he is to ascend. Imagine how he felt, then, when one of those precious spawn simply disappeared into thin air. The only missing ingredient is Astarion. You are the final piece he requires to complete the ritual - your scars bind you to it. Your soul will set off a very wave of death, bringing Cazador his twisted life. And that, my tragic and toothsome friend, is that. Now if you'll excuse me, I have business elsewhere.\nNodeContext: [Tarik] snaps fingers at the end of the line.\nAstarion: Hmm...\nPlayer: 'Hmm'? That's all you have to say?\nAstarion: I was... contemplating. It's a lot to take in. What do you think I should do?\nPlayer: We can't let Cazador complete that ritual. He could unleash terrible horrors.\nAstarion: The end of my life among them. Just when I was starting to enjoy it. He'll never leave me alone. I didn't think he would when I was just one more wretched toy for him to play with. But if I'm the key to this power he craves, he'll hunt me to the ends of Faerûn. I need to take the fight to him. And I need you to help me.\nPlayer: After we dealt with our tadpole problem, yes, I'll help you then.\nAstarion: Once we deal with the tadpole, I'll be back to my nocturnal self. When you're being hunted by vampires, the dark is the worst place to hide. I need to deal with Cazador while I still have any kind of advantage over him. If you won't risk taking him on for my sake, think of the innocent souls he'll sacrifice in this ritual.\nPlayer: You're right - I'll help you destroy him.",

There was no god. Orin held me down in a cocoon of flesh, while a mind flayer forced a parasite into my brain. And she laughed at my fear. I will find her, I will murder her. And I will smile.\nPlayer: Once she's dead, the cult will need new leadership - perhaps we can take her place.\nNightwarden Minthara: It is as if you read my mind. Perhaps you did.\nPlayer: I'm with you.\nNightwarden Minthara: I expected you would be, but know this... What I propose is nigh on impossible, but if anyone can succeed, it is us. We have the Prism, and we have the courage to slay gods. And then we will need no gods. We will be their equal. We will be Absolute. We have a purpose and a bond.

It returns to the hells - to the very point where it last stood before venturing to whichever devilforsaken plane it died on. In the case of our friend Yurgir, the orthon you so handily dispatched in the temple of Shar, he manifested in my House of Hope. He returned to me chastened but intact, his wounds healed, his body restored. He thought I would dismember him but he has his uses so instead I am reeducating him.\nAstarion: We delivered the devil. Now I want what I'm owed - we had a deal.\nRaphael: Indeed we did. I discovered all there is to know about those scars of yours - it's a rather grim tale, even for my tastes.\nPlayer: We had a deal - the orthon for information.\nRaphael: Indeed we did. I discovered all there is to know about those scars of yours - it's a rather grim tale, even for my tastes.\nPlayer: We had a deal - the orthon for information.\nRaphael: Indeed we did. I discovered all there is to know about those scars of yours - it's a rather grim tale, even for my tastes.\nPlayer: Stop stalling.\nRaphael: As you wish. Brace yourself, Astarion - we're about to unveil your destiny. And why would he want to walk away? This is his destiny. As you know already, your precious skin is home to one part of a contract between the archdevil Mephistopheles, and your former master, Cazador Szarr. In full, the contract states that Cazador will be granted knowledge of an infernal ritual so vile it has never been performed. The Rite of Profane Ascension. It promises to be a marvellous ceremony. Very elaborate, incredibly ancient, and entirely diabolical. If he completes the rite, he will become a new kind of being - the Vampire Ascendant. All the strengths of his vampiric form will be amplified, and alongside them he will enjoy the luxuries of the living. The arousals and appetites of man will return to him, and unlike Astarion, he will have no need of a parasite to protect him from the sun. But the ritual has its price, as all worthwhile things do. Lord Cazador will need to sacrifice a number of souls, including all of his vampiric spawn, if he is to ascend. Imagine how he felt, then, when one of those precious spawn simply disappeared into thin air. The only missing ingredient is Astarion. You are the final piece he requires to complete the ritual - your scars bind you to it. Your soul will set off a very wave of death, bringing Cazador his twisted life. And that, my tragic and toothsome friend, is that. Now if you'll excuse me, I have business elsewhere.\nNodeContext: [Tarik] snaps fingers at the end of the line.\nAstarion: Hmm...\nPlayer: You don't need to go back to Cazador - you're with me now.\nAstarion: Do you think it's so simple? What do you think I should do?\nPlayer: You'll never be free while Cazador lives.\nAstarion: I hate how right you are. I knew he wouldn't leave me alone even when I was just another wretched toy for him to play with. But if I'm the key to this power he craves, he'll hunt me to the ends of Faerûn. I need to take the fight to him. And I need you to help me.\nPlayer: If he comes for you, I'll defend you. But we're not risking an attack on his lair.\nAstarion: If you won't risk taking him on for my sake, think of the innocent souls he'll sacrifice in this ritual.\nPlayer: You're right - I'll help you destroy him.",

You want to be bitten?\nAraj Oblodra: To feel your life's blood slipping away? To dance on the edge between life and death? Yes, I want it. I'll even compensate you - a potion of legendary power that forever increases the strength of the one who consumes it. It's not for sale, but it's yours if you bite me.\nAstarion: I will have to decline.\nAraj Oblodra: Excuse me? This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and you're squandering it.\nAstarion: I gave you my answer.\nAraj Oblodra: Can't you talk some sense into your obstinate charge?\nPlayer: He said no.

As you know already, your precious skin is home to one part of a contract between the archdevil Mephistopheles, and your former master, Cazador Szarr. In full, the contract states that Cazador will be granted knowledge of an infernal ritual so vile it has never been performed. The Rite of Profane Ascension. It promises to be a marvellous ceremony. Very elaborate, incredibly ancient, and entirely diabolical. If he completes the rite, he will become a new kind of being - the Vampire Ascendant. All the strengths of his vampiric form will be amplified, and alongside them he will enjoy the luxuries of the living. The arousals and appetites of man will return to him, and unlike Astarion, he will have no need of a parasite to protect him from the sun. But the ritual has its price, as all worthwhile things do. Lord Cazador will need to sacrifice a number of souls, including all of his vampiric spawn, if he is to ascend. Imagine how he felt, then, when one of those precious spawn simply disappeared into thin air. The only missing ingredient is Astarion. You are the final piece he requires to complete the ritual - your scars bind you to it. Your soul will set off a very wave of death, bringing Cazador his twisted life.

I know one of them all too well - Bhaal's blood-letter, Orin. To think I thought her to be speaking for the Absolute. I worshipped that woman.\nPlayer: When I murder her, Bhaal will choose me in her place.\nNightwarden Minthara: I would prefer to put my faith in your strength than the favour of your god. After all, it is Orin and this grand deception that he chose - not you. He favours her, and she is one of the founders of this insane cult. Indeed, she is the one who indoctrinated me with the Absolute's lies.\nPlayer: What can you tell me about Orin?\nNightwarden Minthara: She is fierce, vicious, and cruel. In those respects, we are alike - but she is dangerously unpredictable. If there is a way to turn this design toward slaughter rather than control, she will take it. She is the one who brought me to Moonrise, and into the presence of her so-called god - the Absolute. Now I know that those memories are lies. There was no god. Orin held me down in a cocoon of flesh, while a mind flayer forced a parasite into my brain. And she laughed at my fear. I will find her, I will murder her. And I will smile.\nPlayer: Once she's dead, the cult will need new leadership - perhaps we can take her place.\nNightwarden Minthara: It is as if you read my mind. Perhaps you did.\nPlayer: I'm with you.\nNightwarden Minthara: I expected you would be, but know this... What I propose is nigh on impossible, but if anyone can succeed, it is us. We have the Prism, and we have the courage to slay gods. And then we will need no gods. We will be their equal. We will be Absolute. We have a purpose and a bond. By my oath, I will fight with you while that purpose holds. We are bound, then, to travel together, even if we do not yet agree on our ultimate purpose. There is yet one thing about you that troubles me, though. Something I need you to explain. Why come to Moonrise, where the cult's power is strongest? Why not walk away?",

The rest, I keep for myself.\nPlayer: No, I'm not interested.\nAraj Oblodra: I'm here should you change your mind. There we are. All of your very best traits in a bottle. Use it well! Although perhaps there's one more thing we could discuss: your friend. He's a vampire, no? Or one of their spawn, at least.\nAstarion: Don't worry, we're all friends under the Absolute. I won't bite.\nAraj Oblodra: Oh I'd prefer if you did. I assume he belongs to you?\nPlayer: We travel together - that's all.\nAraj Oblodra: Ah, it's like that. Do you have a name, spawn?\nAstarion: Astarion, but hold on-\nAraj Oblodra: Good. Now, Astarion, I've dreamt of being bitten by a vampire since I was a young girl.\nAstarion: I'm sorry? You want to be bitten?\nAraj Oblodra: To feel your life's blood slipping away? To dance on the edge between life and death? Yes, I want it. I'll even compensate you - a potion of legendary power that forever increases the strength of the one who consumes it. It's not for sale, but it's yours if you bite me.\nAstarion: I will have to decline.\nAraj Oblodra: Excuse me? This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and you're squandering it.\nAstarion: I gave you my answer.\nAraj Oblodra: Can't you talk some sense into your obstinate charge?\nPlayer: Just bite her - the potion sounds useful.\nAstarion: I'm sorry, but could you excuse us a moment? Are you actually asking me to do this? Trading me for some potion? Because there's something wrong with her blood. I can smell it from here - it's rank.\nPlayer: Her house, Oblodra, was infamous for experimenting with mind flayers. Could her blood be tainted somehow?\nAstarion: That would explain the stench, yes. I already have enough illithid filth in my head - I don't want it in my stomach as well.\nAraj Oblodra: I don't have all day, True Soul.\nPlayer: Don't do anything you don't want to.\nAstarion: All right.

Good - let's take her down.\nNightwarden Minthara: You make it sound so simple. She is the Chosen of Bhaal, Lord of Murder, and one of the cult's founders.

There was no god. Orin held me down in a cocoon of flesh, while a mind flayer forced a parasite into my brain. And she laughed at my fear. I will find her, I will murder her. And I will smile.\nPlayer: We'll be heroes - the saviours of Baldur's Gate.\nNightwarden Minthara: Let them think that. There is a short path from saviour to ruler - a short and bloody path. I know it well, and we will walk it together. But Baldur's Gate is a mere bauble. We have the chance to seize something much greater. Surely you see it? In killing Ketheric, we fractured the cult's leadership. When we break the other Chosen and claim their Netherstones, we can take control.\nPlayer: Stealing an entire cult is a new one, even for me.\nNightwarden Minthara: In the long history of these Realms, few people have attempted anything so bold.

I know one of them all too well - Bhaal's blood-letter, Orin. To think I thought her to be speaking for the Absolute. I worshipped that woman.\nPlayer: An old flame?\nNightwarden Minthara: Jealous? You needn't be -  when Orin is in my hands, her agony will nourish me. She is the iblith who indoctrinated me with the Absolute's lies. Indeed, she is the one who indoctrinated me with the Absolute's lies.\nPlayer: What do you remember of your indoctrination?\nNightwarden Minthara: When I first visited Moonrise, I stood before the Absolute in awe. It was more of an idea than an entity. Pure love. Total power. Orin was by my side. She told me that god had chosen me to be a True Soul. Blessed and adored. Now I know that those memories are lies. There was no god. Orin held me down in a cocoon of flesh, while a mind flayer forced a parasite into my brain. And she laughed at my fear. I will find her, I will murder her. And I will smile.\nPlayer: Is vengeance the limit of your ambitions?\nNightwarden Minthara: There is no limit to my ambitions. I will enjoy killing Orin, but unlike her, I do not kill for pleasure alone. I kill to gain advantage. And we have the chance to seize the greatest advantage of all. Surely you see it? In killing Ketheric, we fractured the cult's leadership. When we break the other Chosen and claim their Netherstones, we can take control.\nPlayer: A bold gamble. How can you be sure it's possible?\nNightwarden Minthara: I would have thought this entire conspiracy of gods and monsters to be impossible if I had not seen it for myself. We may fail, but we must try. The power of the enslaved elder brain could reshape the world. We could reshape the world.\nPlayer: It's going to be glorious - I can hardly wait.",

This line should be a transition between the two.\nNettie: You don't have to be here for this.\nLae'zel: I will remain. I've a vested interest in the outcome.\nNettie: All right, let's see what we can do.\nPlayer: Thank you, I'll take anything that can help.\nNettie: Of course. Now, tell me what's been happening. Any symptoms? Strange events?\nPlayer: I can merge my mind with anyone else that's infected.\nNettie: Victims can identify each other? Not that the others know they're victims, of course. How'd you pick up the parasite? Halsin was desperate to find where all this was happening.\nPlayer: You're asking a lot of questions...\nNettie: Of course I am. Lives are on the line, and not just yours. So tell me, where'd you get that thing?\nPlayer: I don't know, I just woke up with it.\nNettie: To hells with it.\nNodeContext: Frustrated, about to attack you because she's run out of other options. She hunches down, ready to swing the thorn, clearly about to attack you.\nPlayer: Don't be a fool. I'd kill you before you could blink.\nNarrator: *She doesn't hesitate, moving quickly. Before you realise what's happening, you feel a burning scratch on your hand.*\nNettie: There. It's done. I'm truly, truly sorry. For what it's worth, the poison is painless. It'll be like going to sleep.\nPlayer: Wait - you poisoned me?!\nNettie: Please, try to relax. This doesn't have to be hard. I'm truly, truly sorry. For what it's worth, the poison is painless. It'll be like going to sleep.\nPlayer: Wait - you poisoned me?!\nNettie: Please, try to relax. This doesn't have to be hard. I'm truly, truly sorry. For what it's worth, the poison is painless. It'll be like going to sleep.\nPlayer: Examine the branch - have you come across this plant before?\nNarrator: *You try to find a clue among the thorns, but there's nothing. You have no idea what poison's tainted your veins.*\nPlayer: Whatever this is, you had better have an antidote.\nNettie: You can't have it. I can't risk you turning - you'd kill us all.\nPlayer: Attack her.",
