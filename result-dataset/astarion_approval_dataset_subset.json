Her hands are in a prayer position and she's chanting softly as the moonlight dances around her. She exhales, then inhales and breaths in tendrils of shadow, absorbing them. She swallows, then begins hacking coughing. The moonlight dissipates. She quickly goes from seeming like a divine spirit to a normal young woman.\nIsobel: I didn't realise I had an audience.\nFist Marcus: Isobel. This is -\nIsobel: A Sharran.\nNarrator: *Isobel. The same name as Ketheric Thorm's daughter - the one whose sarcophagus you found empty in the family mausoleum.*\nPlayer: Push your Urges down.\nPlayer: Isobel - Isobel Thorm?\nNarrator: *Her breath catches; you notice a barely-perceptible shudder run through her body.*\nIsobel: An unfortunate coincidence. I hope never to meet the wicked man who haemorrhaged shadows over this peaceful village. I've heard you might be the person to stop him.\nIsobel: A True Soul with a soul. Imagine.\nIsobel: But if you are who I think you are, I'd be a fool to reject your help. The True Soul with... well, a soul. Imagine.\nPlayer: I'm glad you've remembered who needs whose help here.\nIsobel: Oh - aren't you looking for a protection spell?\nPlayer: I am already protected. My Lady shields me from the curse.\nIsobel: For now, perhaps. But Shar can be fickle, and her love can prove fleeting. Do not turn your back on an advantage you may need... even a Sel√ªnite one.\nIsobel: If nothing else, it can aid any companions who travel with you - somehow I doubt Shar's largesse was extended to them.\nPlayer: It was nothing. Put it out of your mind.\nNarrator: *But was it truly nothing? The pain gripped you tight, robbing you of all composure for a moment...*\nIsobel: Well! If the Moonmaiden didn't strike me dead for blessing you, she must rather approve of this little alliance.\nIsobel: This will block the lesser effects of the shadow curse, allowing you to traverse the darkness outside... should Shar's own protection falter, that is.\nIsobel: It won't be enough to protect you against areas of utter darkness, though - where the curse is strongest. This lantern should, though.\nPlayer: Wait - Marcus is a True Soul, you know. And not the good kind, like me.",

My Lady shields me from the curse.\nIsobel: For now, perhaps. But Shar can be fickle, and her love can prove fleeting. Do not turn your back on an advantage you may need... even a Sel√ªnite one.\nIsobel: If nothing else, it can aid any companions who travel with you - somehow I doubt Shar's largesse was extended to them.\nPlayer: Ngh... it hurts...\nIsobel: Well! If the Moonmaiden didn't strike me dead for blessing you, she must rather approve of this little alliance.\nIsobel: This will block the lesser effects of the shadow curse, allowing you to traverse the darkness outside... should Shar's own protection falter, that is.\nIsobel: It won't be enough to protect you against areas of utter darkness, though - where the curse is strongest. This lantern should, though.\nPlayer: Very nice of you, but I've been to Moonrise Towers already.\nIsobel: You... have. Forgive me for gilding the lily. I suppose if Jaheira hasn't gone tearing into the night, there's work to be done there yet.\nIsobel: I wish you luck. The very best of it.\nPlayer: Hold on - Marcus is a True Soul.

Not into a tender neck, but into the twisting body of a rat - the only thing your master lets you eat.*\nPlayer: Why didn't you tell me you were a vampire?\nPlayer: Why didn't you tell me?\nAstarion: At best, I was sure you'd say no. More likely, you'd ram a stake through my ribs.\nAstarion: No, I needed you to trust me. And you can trust me.\nPlayer: You tried to bite me. How can I trust you?\nAstarion: Because we don't have a choice! Not if we're going to save ourselves from these worms.\nAstarion: I need you alive. You need me strong.\nAstarion: Please. Only be a taste, I swear. I'll be well, you'll be fine, and everything can go back to normal.\nPlayer: Fine. But not a drop more than you need.\nAstarion: Really? I - of course. Not one drop more.\nAstarion: Let's make ourselves comfortable, shall we?\nNodeContext: Astarion gestures, inviting the player to lie down on the bedroll at his feet.\nNarrator: *It's like a shard of ice into your neck - a quick, sharp pain that fades to throbbing numbness. Your breath catches, your pulse quickens.*\nPlayer: That's enough.\nAstarion: Mhh? Oh, of course.\nAstarion: That - that was amazing.\nAstarion: My mind is finally clear. I feel strong. I feel... happy!\nPlayer: I don't. That felt wrong.\nAstarion: Don't be so dramatic. This is just a little transaction between friends.\nAstarion: And look what you've gained. Together, we can take on the world.\nPlayer: You need to leave my camp. Now.",

Regretting it yet?\nWulbren Bongle: I spent a lot of time thinking of worst case scenarios while I was locked in that cell you plucked me out of at Moonrise.\nWulbren Bongle: I didn't imagine anything as bad as this. The Gondians have handed Enver Gortash the means to bring about the end of liberty in Baldur's Gate.\nWulbren Bongle: And the citizens have rolled out the red carpet for their new tyrant.\nWulbren Bongle: Resistance fighters are few and far between - my Ironhands, what's left of the Harpers, and you. I hope.\nPlayer: I'm with you.\nWulbren Bongle: Good. We don't have a chance unless we stick together - not while the Gondians' metal monsters are patrolling the streets.\nWulbren Bongle: The Steel Watch. They're a threat to you, me - and every man, woman and child in the city.\nWulbren Bongle: They act all civilised... servants of the people. But they only serve one man.\nWulbren Bongle: When he becomes Grand Duke, it will only get worse. Laws will change, freedoms will vanish, and soon you'll be accused and sentenced before you've even committed a crime.\nWulbren Bongle: And the fucking Gondians are to blame for all of it.\nPlayer: Perhaps the Gondians were infected with a tadpole?\nWulbren Bongle: Perhaps. All the more reason to get rid of them.\nWulbren Bongle: They invented the Steel Watchers. And they're building an army of them.\nWulbren Bongle: They've always been happy to provide their technology to despots in exchange for a stipend and the freedom to work in peace.\nWulbren Bongle: They would have licked Sarevok's boots given the chance, and now they'll kiss Gortash's ring while the city screams.\nWulbren Bongle: I had a plan to put a stop to them. But the way things are now, if we stick our heads above ground, the Watchers are on us like flies on shit.\nPlayer: What was the plan?\nWulbren Bongle: Same as it always is. Eliminate the threat.\nWulbren Bongle: In this case - the foundry where these atrocities are produced.\nWulbren Bongle: The Gondians are ingenious. But we're more than equal to them - there's nothing they can build that the Ironhands can't tear down.\nWulbren Bongle: I've built something unique for just that purpose.\nWulbren Bongle: A runepowder bomb - first of its kind. Fifty wizards high on the Weave couldn't summon this kind of firepower.\nWulbren Bongle: Get the bomb inside the Gondian facility, and - boom. Problem solved.\nBarcus Wroot: Wulbren, please. This is too far! Everyone in the foundry would be killed.\nWulbren Bongle: Quiet, Barcus. The adults are talking.\nPlayer: This plan seems a bit loud for my liking. Messy, too.\nBarcus Wroot: That's what I've been saying! There may yet be a peaceful solution.\nWulbren Bongle: Fine. You want to try flapping your gums in the belly of the beast, be my guest.\nWulbren Bongle: But their idea of diplomacy is a steel fist shoved where the sun don't shine.\nWulbren Bongle: So take the bomb. Just in case I'm right, and you're wrong.\nPlayer: Keep your bomb. I'm doing this my way.",

I put an arrow through his eye myself, only to watch him pluck it out like a splinter.\nJaheira: He healed right in front of me, and chased us into the shadows.

He wants to kidnap Isobel.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Jaheir takes the glass from the table.\nJaheira: This place is crawling with Harpers. If Marcus managed to get himself infected, we would've known the same minute.\nJaheira: Is this some kind of test? Or a game, perhaps?\nPlayer: I have proof, if you'll just come upstairs and look.\nJaheira: A Harper's gaze can only be turned by proof. By the looks of it, a tall tale is all you have to offer.\nJaheira: It doesn't spoil the taste, if that's what you're wondering.\nPlayer: I prefer using Venian's Breath for interrogations - it doesn't carry a scent.\nJaheira: Not, but it does leave the subject paralysed. Whatever comes after, I would have you standing on your own two feet.\nPlayer: Drink the wine.",

    "conversation": "Raphael: Do you know what happens when a devil is struck down on this charming plane of existence?\nRaphael: It returns to the hells - to the very point where it last stood before venturing to whichever devilforsaken plane it died on.\nRaphael: In the case of our friend Yurgir, the orthon you so handily dispatched in the temple of Shar, he manifested in my House of Hope.\nRaphael: He returned to me chastened but intact, his wounds healed, his body restored.\nRaphael: He thought I would dismember him but he has his uses so instead I am reeducating him.\nAstarion: We delivered the devil. Now I want what I'm owed - we had a deal.\nRaphael: Indeed we did. I discovered all there is to know about those scars of yours - it's a rather grim tale, even for my tastes.\nPlayer: We had a deal - the orthon for information.\nRaphael: Indeed we did.

We're about to unveil your destiny - you should be quivering in anticipation.\nRaphael: Carved into that ivory skin of yours is one part of an infernal contract between the archdevil Mephistopheles and your former master, Cazador Szarr.\nRaphael: In full, the contract states that Cazador will be granted knowledge of an infernal ritual so vile it has never been performed.\nRaphael: The Rite of Profane Ascension.\nRaphael: It promises to be a marvellous ceremony. Very elaborate, incredibly ancient, and entirely diabolical.\nRaphael: If he completes the rite, he will become a new kind of being - the Vampire Ascendant.\nRaphael: All the strengths of his vampiric form will be amplified, and alongside them he will enjoy the luxuries of the living.\nRaphael: The arousals and appetites of man will return to him, and unlike Astarion, he will have no need of a parasite to protect him from the sun.\nRaphael: But the ritual has its price, as all worthwhile things do. Lord Cazador will need to sacrifice a number of souls, including all of his vampiric spawn, if he is to ascend.\nRaphael: Imagine how he felt, then, when one of those precious spawn simply disappeared into thin air.\nRaphael: The only missing ingredient is Astarion.\nRaphael: You are the final piece he requires to complete the ritual - your scars bind you to it. Your soul will set off a very wave of death, bringing Cazador his twisted life.\nRaphael: And that, my tragic and toothsome friend, is that. Now if you'll excuse me, I have business elsewhere.\nNodeContext: [Tarik] snaps fingers at the end of the line.\nAstarion: Hmm...\nPlayer: Cazador is a piece of shit. We're going to stop him.\nAstarion: Do you think it's so simple?\nAstarion: What do you think I should do?\nPlayer: You'll never be free while Cazador lives.\nAstarion: I hate how right you are.\nAstarion: I knew he wouldn't leave me alone even when I was just another wretched toy for him to play with.\nAstarion: But if I'm the key to this power he craves, he'll hunt me to the ends of Faer√ªn.\nAstarion: I need to take the fight to him.\nAstarion: And I need you to help me.\nPlayer: After we dealt with our tadpole problem, yes, I'll help you then.\nAstarion: Once we deal with the tadpole, I'll be back to my nocturnal self. When you're being hunted by vampires, the dark is the worst place to hide.\nAstarion: I need to deal with Cazador while I still have any kind of advantage over him.\nAstarion: If you won't risk taking him on for my sake, think of the innocent souls he'll sacrifice in this ritual.\nPlayer: The Absolute is a greater threat - we need to focus.",

Let me tell you what I know.\nHalsin: I've been studying these parasites for a while now. Ever since I discovered these so-called True Souls are infected with them.\nHalsin: Someone is using very powerful magic to modify these tadpoles. They are using them to exert control over the infected.\nHalsin: I'm sorry to say, I can't undo that magic, which means I can't cure you. But that doesn't mean I can't help.\nHalsin: I didn't find what I came here for - a way to remove the tadpoles - but I found the next best thing. I found out where they come from.\nHalsin: That must be where these enchantments are placed on them, and it's where you'll find your cure.\nPlayer: So all of this was for nothing.\nHalsin: Patience. I can't just snap my fingers... but I know where the solution almost certainly lies.\nHalsin: I overheard that the cultists are sending all of their captives to Moonrise Towers.\nHalsin: Innocents go in, True Souls come out. Given that all of these True Souls are infected, it has to be the source of this magic.\nHalsin: If you want to find a cure, you must head there and discover how the tadpoles are being manipulated.\nPlayer: You seem to know a lot about this. Will you come with me to Moonrise?\nHalsin: I wish I could, but there's still work I've yet to finish - blood I've yet to spill.\nHalsin: I've no right to ask more of you... but if you could help me, I'd be free to join your journey to Moonrise.\nHalsin: I cannot allow these butchers to threaten my grove.

I'll deal with her when I can.\nHalsin: But there are other matters to attend to before that.\nHalsin: Chaos is welcome, in doses; it helps keep balance. But this is too much - this is unnatural.\nHalsin: It's too late to merely kill this horde's leadership - their forces are already marching. If you want me to help, you need to help me first.\nHalsin: You must get ahead of them, muster the defences.\nPlayer: Very well. I'll go rescue the grove.",

Would you be interested in studying it?\nHavkelaag: A githyanki egg? What a fortuitous turn of events. I've been attempting to get my hands on one for some time now.\nHavkelaag: Would you consider parting with it? The Society's coffers are deep enough to cover any expenses accrued in its retrieval, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: Chk. Don't you dare consider it.\nPlayer: What are you going to do with it?\nHavkelaag: Study it, of course. The githyanki have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months.\nHavkelaag: You are no doubt aware that citizens of the Underdark are held in great suspicion by those who live above ground. Many believe us to be 'evil'.\nHavkelaag: The githyanki face similar prejudice, but I believe, if hatched in a less violent, more intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome its evil predispositions.\nHavkelaag: I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: You're letting your personal biases affect your method. Why assume they're evil?\nHavkelaag: I assume nothing. Innate githyanki cruelty is an established fact - no doubt you witnessed it yourself in the retrieval of the egg itself.\nHavkelaag: When I have a suitable sample for my study, I will, however, prove that the effects of their biological inclination are reversible.\nHavkelaag: Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach:\nHavkelaag: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue.\nHavkelaag: Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: Why follow the dogma of a draconic god?\nHavkelaag: In my years of study, they're the closest I've found to moral perfection. Only under such rigorous 'goodness' will the subject stand a chance of being cured.\nHavkelaag: My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: An experiment like this will only confirm the surface dwellers' suspicion of us.\nHavkelaag: Of course it won't. If anything, it will do quite the opposite. The academic institutions up here will finally be forced to take us seriously.\nHavkelaag: Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg? ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: A gith hatchling is not a lab rat!

Not the traps, the dark or the creatures it hides. Something stronger holds me - a contract.\nYurgir: Either I fulfil the contract, die trying... or forfeit my freedom. If I leave this place now, I'll become Raphael's slave.\nPlayer: Raphael is a devil like all your kind - he deals in tricks.

Don't you dare consider it.\nPlayer: What are you going to do with it?\nHavkelaag: Study it, of course. The githyanki have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months.\nHavkelaag: You yourself have no doubt experienced the prejudice of those who assume that, as beings of the Underdark, we are inherently evil.\nHavkelaag: The githyanki face similar prejudice, but I believe, if hatched in a less violent, more intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome its evil predispositions.\nHavkelaag: I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: So the child inside will be experimented on?\nHavkelaag: Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach:\nHavkelaag: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue.\nHavkelaag: Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: So you, too, follow the teachings of Bahamut. Why him?\nHavkelaag: In my years of study, they're the closest I've found to moral perfection. Only under such rigorous 'goodness' will the subject stand a chance of being cured.\nHavkelaag: My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: No benefit could justify you inflicting such cruelty.\nHavkelaag: Rigorous experimental methods demand we do not indulge our own emotional responses in the application of discomfort to our subjects.\nHavkelaag: Only by the full, uninhibited application of psionic stimuli will we have a true measure of whether the child's innate evil has been cured.\nHavkelaag: Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg?

Regretting it yet?\nWulbren Bongle: I spent a lot of time thinking of worst case scenarios while I was locked in that cell you plucked me out of at Moonrise.\nWulbren Bongle: I didn't imagine anything as bad as this. The Gondians have handed Enver Gortash the means to bring about the end of liberty in Baldur's Gate.\nWulbren Bongle: And the citizens have rolled out the red carpet for their new tyrant.\nWulbren Bongle: Resistance fighters are few and far between - my Ironhands, what's left of the Harpers, and you. I hope.\nPlayer: I'm with you.\nWulbren Bongle: Good. We don't have a chance unless we stick together - not while the Gondians' metal monsters are patrolling the streets.\nWulbren Bongle: The Steel Watch. They're a threat to you, me - and every man, woman and child in the city.\nWulbren Bongle: They act all civilised... servants of the people. But they only serve one man.\nWulbren Bongle: When he becomes Grand Duke, it will only get worse. Laws will change, freedoms will vanish, and soon you'll be accused and sentenced before you've even committed a crime.\nWulbren Bongle: And the fucking Gondians are to blame for all of it.\nPlayer: Cheer up Wulbren. We're here to help.\nWulbren Bongle: I heard about that. You had the Harpers all excited, but there aren't many Harpers left.\nWulbren Bongle: These Steel Watchers. One of them is the equivalent of a red dragon. An army of them, well... there's never been an army of dragons.\nPlayer: I'm not scared of dragons. Or Steel Watchers.\nWulbren Bongle: There's a line where bravery becomes stupidity. You just crossed it.\nWulbren Bongle: Scared or not, you can't take down every Steel Watcher in the city. Unless you hit the people who build them - the Gondians.\nWulbren Bongle: They've always been happy to provide their technology to despots in exchange for a stipend and the freedom to work in peace.\nWulbren Bongle: They would have licked Sarevok's boots given the chance, and now they'll kiss Gortash's ring while the city screams.\nWulbren Bongle: I had a plan to put a stop to them. But the way things are now, if we stick our heads above ground, the Watchers are on us like flies on shit.\nPlayer: No plan survives contact with the enemy - unless I'm involved.\nWulbren Bongle: Exactly. You freed us from Ketheric's rotten cells - I reckon you can rid us of these Gondians just as easily.\nWulbren Bongle: You just need a little assistance, and I can provide it.\nWulbren Bongle: The Gondians are ingenious. But we're more than equal to them - there's nothing they can build that the Ironhands can't tear down.\nWulbren Bongle: I've built something unique for just that purpose.\nWulbren Bongle: A runepowder bomb - first of its kind. Fifty wizards high on the Weave couldn't summon this kind of firepower.\nWulbren Bongle: Get the bomb inside the Gondian facility, and - boom. Problem solved.\nBarcus Wroot: Wulbren, please. This is too far! Everyone in the foundry would be killed.\nWulbren Bongle: Quiet, Barcus. The adults are talking.\nPlayer: Barcus has a point - this sounds like mass murder.\nWulbren Bongle: It's liberation.\nWulbren Bongle: The Gondians picked their side the minute they took orders from Gortash.\nWulbren Bongle: If they had any courage, they'd have refused him and died like heroes, spitting in his face.\nWulbren Bongle: Now they'll die like the dogs they are.\nPlayer: I'll make contact with the Gondians - maybe they'll see reason.\nBarcus Wroot: That's what I've been saying! There may yet be a peaceful solution.\nWulbren Bongle: Fine. You want to try flapping your gums in the belly of the beast, be my guest.\nWulbren Bongle: But their idea of diplomacy is a steel fist shoved where the sun don't shine.\nWulbren Bongle: So take the bomb. Just in case I'm right, and you're wrong.\nPlayer: Keep your bomb. I'm doing this my way.",

Many believe us to be 'evil'.\nHavkelaag: The githyanki face similar prejudice, but I believe, if hatched in a less violent, more intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome its evil predispositions.\nHavkelaag: I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: So the child inside will be experimented on?\nHavkelaag: Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach:\nHavkelaag: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue.\nHavkelaag: Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: Why follow the dogma of a draconic god?\nHavkelaag: In my years of study, they're the closest I've found to moral perfection.

Now I want what I'm owed - we had a deal.\nRaphael: Indeed we did.

Very elaborate, incredibly ancient, and entirely diabolical.\nRaphael: If he completes the rite, he will become a new kind of being - the Vampire Ascendant.\nRaphael: All the strengths of his vampiric form will be amplified, and alongside them he will enjoy the luxuries of the living.\nRaphael: The arousals and appetites of man will return to him, and unlike Astarion, he will have no need of a parasite to protect him from the sun.\nRaphael: But the ritual has its price, as all worthwhile things do. Lord Cazador will need to sacrifice a number of souls, including all of his vampiric spawn, if he is to ascend.\nRaphael: Imagine how he felt, then, when one of those precious spawn simply disappeared into thin air.\nRaphael: The only missing ingredient is Astarion.\nRaphael: You are the final piece he requires to complete the ritual - your scars bind you to it. Your soul will set off a very wave of death, bringing Cazador his twisted life.\nRaphael: And that, my tragic and toothsome friend, is that.

Why him?\nHavkelaag: In my years of study, they're the closest I've found to moral perfection. Only under such rigorous 'goodness' will the subject stand a chance of being cured.\nHavkelaag: My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: Your findings are irrelevant, as are the opinions of all on this kaincha plane.\nHavkelaag: Ah. A display of the well-known githyanki arrogance. I am not sure my experiment can cure that particular affliction, but give me time and I will find a way.\nHavkelaag: Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg?

    "conversation": "Havkelaag: Ah, a surface dweller.\nHavkelaag: You find yourself in the cradle of all knowledge relating to the Underdark: the Society of Brilliance.\nHavkelaag: Tell me, what can the Society do for you?\nPlayer: I met an expeditioner claiming to work for you. She sought a githyanki egg.\nHavkelaag: Yes, dear Lady Esther. One of our most reliable contractors, though unfortunately this particular request was too much even for her.\nHavkelaag: I believe she quite lost her senses over the task. She came here insisting I purchase an owlbear egg from her, of all things.\nHavkelaag: I don't suppose you've stumbled across any githyanki eggs during your travels? The Society will compensate you for any we purchase, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nHavkelaag: Would you consider parting with it? The Society's coffers are deep enough to cover any expenses accrued in its retrieval, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: Chk. Don't you dare consider it.\nPlayer: What are you going to do with it?\nHavkelaag: Study it, of course. The githyanki have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months.\nHavkelaag: You are no doubt aware that citizens of the Underdark are held in great suspicion by those who live above ground. Many believe us to be 'evil'.\nHavkelaag: The githyanki face similar prejudice, but I believe, if hatched in a less violent, more intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome its evil predispositions.\nHavkelaag: I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: So the child inside will be experimented on?\nHavkelaag: Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach:\nHavkelaag: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue.\nHavkelaag: Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: You would teach the child virtue, but rear it without patience. Curious.\nHavkelaag: Tell me, then, philosopher - if patience delays the fostering of the other virtues, can it be rightly called virtuous?\nPlayer: By your words, any virtue delaying patience would itself be unvirtuous.\nHavkelaag: And therein lies your fault: you would have us argue in circles until the egg hatches naturally. Time we do not have.\nHavkelaag: My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: An experiment like this will only confirm the surface dwellers' suspicion of us.\nHavkelaag: Of course it won't. If anything, it will do quite the opposite. The academic institutions up here will finally be forced to take us seriously.\nHavkelaag: Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg? ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: A gith hatchling is not a lab rat! This shka'keth should be bled dry for the mere suggestion.\nPlayer: This experiment is barbaric. You're never getting the egg.",

A man of the people, very palatable, like a sweet cider.\nAstarion: But the gith? What in the hells would she taste like?\nPlayer: Something exotic, surely?

Now I want what I'm owed - we had a deal.\nRaphael: Indeed we did. I discovered all there is to know about those scars of yours - it's a rather grim tale, even for my tastes.\nPlayer: Spill it - this sounds fascinating.\nAstarion: I'd appreciate a little less enthusiasm when it comes to Cazador and his horrors.\nRaphael: Oh come, Astarion. We're about to unveil your destiny - you should be quivering in anticipation.\nRaphael: As you know already, your precious skin is home to one part of a contract between the archdevil Mephistopheles, and your former master, Cazador Szarr.\nRaphael: In full, the contract states that Cazador will be granted knowledge of an infernal ritual so vile it has never been performed.\nRaphael: The Rite of Profane Ascension.\nRaphael: It promises to be a marvellous ceremony. Very elaborate, incredibly ancient, and entirely diabolical.\nRaphael: If he completes the rite, he will become a new kind of being - the Vampire Ascendant.\nRaphael: All the strengths of his vampiric form will be amplified, and alongside them he will enjoy the luxuries of the living.\nRaphael: The arousals and appetites of man will return to him, and unlike you, he will have no need of a parasite to protect him from the sun.\nRaphael: But the ritual has its price, as all worthwhile things do. Lord Cazador will need to sacrifice a number of souls, including all of his vampiric spawn, if he is to ascend.\nRaphael: Imagine how he felt, then, when one of those precious spawn simply disappeared into thin air.\nRaphael: The only missing ingredient is Astarion.\nRaphael: You are the final piece he requires to complete the ritual - your scars bind you to it. Your soul will set off a very wave of death, bringing Cazador his twisted life.\nRaphael: And that, my tragic and toothsome friend, is that. Now if you'll excuse me, I have business elsewhere.\nNodeContext: [Tarik] snaps fingers at the end of the line.\nAstarion: Hmm...\nPlayer: 'Hmm'? That's all you have to say?\nAstarion: I was... contemplating.

But we're not risking an attack on his lair.\nAstarion: If you won't risk taking him on for my sake, think of the innocent souls he'll sacrifice in this ritual.\nPlayer: The Absolute is a greater threat - we need to focus.",

Elturel had no place for tieflings after the Descent.\nNarrator: *You remember it.

What is that?\nZevlor: I'm surprised you haven't heard of it.\nZevlor: The High Overseer - our grand protector - signed a pact with devils. It dragged Elturel straight to Hell.\nZevlor: Lucky for us, a group of adventurers found a way to bring the city back.\nZevlor: Afterwards, people looked at us and just saw 'devilkin'. No different from the druids here, really.\nZevlor: We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: This ritual - is there no way to convince the druids to stop it?\nZevlor: I've tried. Kagha - their new First Druid - won't even see me.\nZevlor: You, though... I know it's not your business, but she owes you for saving this place.\nZevlor: Perhaps you could persuade her. For more time to prepare, if nothing else.\nPlayer: I'll see what I can do.\nPlayer: I'll find her. And I'll speak to Kagha while I'm there.",

It doesn't hurt to ponder the question, though.\nAstarion: I don't think they'd volunteer, of course, but it doesn't make me any less curious.\nAstarion: Take Shadowheart, for example.

    "conversation": "Raphael: Do you know what happens when a devil is struck down on this charming plane of existence?\nRaphael: It returns to the hells - to the very point where it last stood before venturing to whichever devilforsaken plane it died on.\nRaphael: In the case of our friend Yurgir, the orthon you so handily dispatched in the temple of Shar, he manifested in my House of Hope.\nRaphael: He returned to me chastened but intact, his wounds healed, his body restored.\nRaphael: He thought I would dismember him but he has his uses so instead I am reeducating him.\nAstarion: We delivered the devil. Now I want what I'm owed - we had a deal.\nRaphael: Indeed we did. I discovered all there is to know about those scars of yours - it's a rather grim tale, even for my tastes.\nPlayer: Spill it - this sounds fascinating.\nAstarion: I'd appreciate a little less enthusiasm when it comes to Cazador and his horrors.\nRaphael: Oh come, Astarion. We're about to unveil your destiny - you should be quivering in anticipation.\nRaphael: As you know already, your precious skin is home to one part of a contract between the archdevil Mephistopheles, and your former master, Cazador Szarr.\nRaphael: In full, the contract states that Cazador will be granted knowledge of an infernal ritual so vile it has never been performed.\nRaphael: The Rite of Profane Ascension.\nRaphael: It promises to be a marvellous ceremony. Very elaborate, incredibly ancient, and entirely diabolical.\nRaphael: If he completes the rite, he will become a new kind of being - the Vampire Ascendant.\nRaphael: All the strengths of his vampiric form will be amplified, and alongside them he will enjoy the luxuries of the living.\nRaphael: The arousals and appetites of man will return to him, and unlike you, he will have no need of a parasite to protect him from the sun.\nRaphael: But the ritual has its price, as all worthwhile things do. Lord Cazador will need to sacrifice a number of souls, including all of his vampiric spawn, if he is to ascend.\nRaphael: Imagine how he felt, then, when one of those precious spawn simply disappeared into thin air.\nRaphael: The only missing ingredient is Astarion.\nRaphael: You are the final piece he requires to complete the ritual - your scars bind you to it. Your soul will set off a very wave of death, bringing Cazador his twisted life.\nRaphael: And that, my tragic and toothsome friend, is that. Now if you'll excuse me, I have business elsewhere.\nNodeContext: [Tarik] snaps fingers at the end of the line.\nAstarion: Hmm...\nPlayer: You're... quiet. It's unsettling.\nAstarion: It's a lot to take in.\nAstarion: What do you think I should do?\nPlayer: I think you should run. If Cazador can't find you, he can't complete his ritual.\n\nAstarion: How long do you think I can run? He has eternity to find me.\nAstarion: He'll never leave me alone. I didn't think he would when I was just one more wretched toy for him to play with.\nAstarion: But if I'm the key to this power he craves, he'll hunt me to the ends of Faer√ªn.\nAstarion: I need to take the fight to him.\nAstarion: And I need you to help me.\nPlayer: If he comes for you, I'll defend you. But we're not risking an attack on his lair.\nAstarion: If you won't risk taking him on for my sake, think of the innocent souls he'll sacrifice in this ritual.\nPlayer: The Absolute is a greater threat - we need to focus.",

He and I have history.\nJaheira: You were the one who rescued those the Absolute had imprisoned. You were courageous to brave the depths of Ketheric's stronghold.\nJaheira: I suppose you know about Ketheric, then. His invincibility. That we'll never cleanse this place until he's made to bleed.\nJaheira: We met him on the road here - commanding an army of the Absolute, intent on destroying Baldur's Gate. I put an arrow through his eye myself, only to watch him pluck it out like a splinter.\nJaheira: He healed right in front of me, and chased us into the shadows. Things looked hopeless, but experience has taught me that no matter how bleak things look, there's always hope.\nJaheira: You are that hope.\nPlayer: It's rare people look at me and see 'hope'.\nJaheira: The light is rather dim, out here in the shadowlands. The point remains:\nJaheira: Protected by your artefact, you can infiltrate his forces at Moonrise Towers, posing as a True Soul.\nJaheira: Find out what it is that makes him invincible so we can strip him of his advantage.\nJaheira: Once Ketheric is without his shield, the sword: together we assault his tower, and put a final end to this blight.\nPlayer: There's something you should know - Marcus, the Flaming Fist upstairs, is a True Soul. He wants to kidnap Isobel.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Jaheir takes the glass from the table.\nJaheira: This place is crawling with Harpers.

It's your own funeral.\nJaheira: I'm not ignoring you - I just see no evidence of your rather outlandish claim.\nJaheira: You've come from the shadows and wasted no time accusing one of our companions of treason. It's all a little... odd.\nJaheira: A Harper's gaze can only be turned by proof.

Would you be interested in studying it?\nHavkelaag: A githyanki egg? What a fortuitous turn of events. I've been attempting to get my hands on one for some time now.\nHavkelaag: Would you consider parting with it? The Society's coffers are deep enough to cover any expenses accrued in its retrieval, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: Chk. Don't you dare consider it.\nPlayer: What are you going to do with it?\nHavkelaag: Study it, of course. The githyanki have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months.\nHavkelaag: You are no doubt aware that citizens of the Underdark are held in great suspicion by those who live above ground. Many believe us to be 'evil'.\nHavkelaag: The githyanki face similar prejudice, but I believe, if hatched in a less violent, more intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome its evil predispositions.\nHavkelaag: I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: So the child inside will be experimented on?\nHavkelaag: Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach:\nHavkelaag: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue.\nHavkelaag: Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: Why follow the dogma of a draconic god?\nHavkelaag: In my years of study, they're the closest I've found to moral perfection. Only under such rigorous 'goodness' will the subject stand a chance of being cured.\nHavkelaag: My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: Sounds pointless. Public opinion will hardly be swayed by such a small experiment.\nHavkelaag: Not at first. But if the experiment proves successful, it must be repeated. Only then will we know if the findings are to be trusted.\nHavkelaag: Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg? ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: A gith hatchling is not a lab rat!

This is his destiny.\nRaphael: As you know already, your precious skin is home to one part of a contract between the archdevil Mephistopheles, and your former master, Cazador Szarr.\nRaphael: In full, the contract states that Cazador will be granted knowledge of an infernal ritual so vile it has never been performed.\nRaphael: The Rite of Profane Ascension.\nRaphael: It promises to be a marvellous ceremony. Very elaborate, incredibly ancient, and entirely diabolical.\nRaphael: If he completes the rite, he will become a new kind of being - the Vampire Ascendant.\nRaphael: All the strengths of his vampiric form will be amplified, and alongside them he will enjoy the luxuries of the living.\nRaphael: The arousals and appetites of man will return to him, and unlike Astarion, he will have no need of a parasite to protect him from the sun.\nRaphael: But the ritual has its price, as all worthwhile things do. Lord Cazador will need to sacrifice a number of souls, including all of his vampiric spawn, if he is to ascend.\nRaphael: Imagine how he felt, then, when one of those precious spawn simply disappeared into thin air.\nRaphael: The only missing ingredient is Astarion.\nRaphael: You are the final piece he requires to complete the ritual - your scars bind you to it. Your soul will set off a very wave of death, bringing Cazador his twisted life.\nRaphael: And that, my tragic and toothsome friend, is that. Now if you'll excuse me, I have business elsewhere.\nNodeContext: [Tarik] snaps fingers at the end of the line.\nAstarion: Hmm...\nPlayer: You don't need to go back to Cazador - you're with me now.\nAstarion: Do you think it's so simple?\nAstarion: What do you think I should do?\nPlayer: I think you should run. If Cazador can't find you, he can't complete his ritual.\n\nAstarion: How long do you think I can run? He has eternity to find me.\nAstarion: He'll never leave me alone. I didn't think he would when I was just one more wretched toy for him to play with.\nAstarion: But if I'm the key to this power he craves, he'll hunt me to the ends of Faer√ªn.\nAstarion: I need to take the fight to him.\nAstarion: And I need you to help me.\nPlayer: After we dealt with our tadpole problem, yes, I'll help you then.\nAstarion: Once we deal with the tadpole, I'll be back to my nocturnal self. When you're being hunted by vampires, the dark is the worst place to hide.\nAstarion: I need to deal with Cazador while I still have any kind of advantage over him.\nAstarion: If you won't risk taking him on for my sake, think of the innocent souls he'll sacrifice in this ritual.\nPlayer: The Absolute is a greater threat - we need to focus.",

She came here insisting I purchase an owlbear egg from her, of all things.\nHavkelaag: I don't suppose you've stumbled across any githyanki eggs during your travels?

Evil, if you will.\nHavkelaag: As citizens of the Underdark, we face similar stigmas. Totally unfounded, of course - our natures are as unfixed as any who walk the surface.\nHavkelaag: I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: You're letting your personal biases affect your method. Why assume they're evil?\nHavkelaag: I assume nothing. Innate githyanki cruelty is an established fact - no doubt you witnessed it yourself in the retrieval of the egg itself.\nHavkelaag: When I have a suitable sample for my study, I will, however, prove that the effects of their biological inclination are reversible.\nHavkelaag: Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach:\nHavkelaag: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue.\nHavkelaag: Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: You would teach the child virtue, but rear it without patience. Curious.\nHavkelaag: Tell me, then, philosopher - if patience delays the fostering of the other virtues, can it be rightly called virtuous?\nPlayer: Patience does not delay, it simply tempers virtue. Curtails it from excess.\nHavkelaag: A cautious, hesitant instinct. One I am afraid we do not have time for.\nHavkelaag: My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: No benefit could justify you inflicting such cruelty.\nHavkelaag: Rigorous experimental methods demand we do not indulge our own emotional responses in the application of discomfort to our subjects.\nHavkelaag: Only by the full, uninhibited application of psionic stimuli will we have a true measure of whether the child's innate evil has been cured.\nHavkelaag: Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg?

She sought a githyanki egg.\nHavkelaag: Yes, dear Lady Esther. One of our most reliable contractors, though unfortunately this particular request was too much even for her.\nHavkelaag: I believe she quite lost her senses over the task. She came here insisting I purchase an owlbear egg from her, of all things.\nHavkelaag: I don't suppose you've stumbled across any githyanki eggs during your travels? The Society will compensate you for any we purchase, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nHavkelaag: Would you consider parting with it? The Society's coffers are deep enough to cover any expenses accrued in its retrieval, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: Chk. Don't you dare consider it.\nPlayer: What are you going to do with it?\nHavkelaag: Study it, of course. Your kind have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months.\nHavkelaag: Most on this plane believe you to be innately cruel, violent beings. Evil, if you will.\nHavkelaag: As citizens of the Underdark, we face similar stigmas. Totally unfounded, of course - our natures are as unfixed as any who walk the surface.\nHavkelaag: I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: What does this 'intellectually stimulating' upbringing look like?\nHavkelaag: In the literal sense, I will need to induce the egg to hatch via the application of certain currents to the creature inside.\nHavkelaag: Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach:\nHavkelaag: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue.\nHavkelaag: Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: This experiment is exactly the kind of evil you're trying to disprove.\nHavkelaag: The pursuit of knowledge is neither evil nor good. Only in the application of such knowledge should one take on any moral imperative.\nHavkelaag: My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: No benefit could justify you inflicting such cruelty.\nHavkelaag: Rigorous experimental methods demand we do not indulge our own emotional responses in the application of discomfort to our subjects.\nHavkelaag: Only by the full, uninhibited application of psionic stimuli will we have a true measure of whether the child's innate evil has been cured.\nHavkelaag: Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg? ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: A gith hatchling is not a lab rat! This shka'keth should be bled dry for the mere suggestion.\nPlayer: This experiment is barbaric. You're never getting the egg.",

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon‚Äôs voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar.\nMalus Thorm: See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy.\nMalus Thorm: Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human‚Äôs belly, but it‚Äôs a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace.\nMalus Thorm: Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver.\nMalus Thorm: Come. Step forward. You are no sister, but that matters none. Every student is welcome.\nPlayer: I don't wish to study, only to lift the curse on this land.\nMalus Thorm: A curse? Nay, a cure that leads to the very pinnacle of being:\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence.

What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being?\nMalus Thorm: If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: But you: look how the succour of Shar eludes you. See how painfully present you remain...\nMalus Thorm: We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: Their blades are uneven. Efficient surgery will require further training.\nMalus Thorm: Their incisions are, as yet, still streaked with imprecision - that much I must concede.\nMalus Thorm: How to steady their hands, I wonder.\nPlayer: 'Only with sacrifice is mastery gained.' For the sisters to learn, you must submit.\nMalus Thorm: Yes. Submit I must, into the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nMalus Thorm: I see now.

Jaheira was called in crime dialog.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: | (CINE) Jaheira approaches. Haper Elifer is about to speak, but a stern glance from Jaheira shuts them up and makes them cast her eyes to the ground. Jaheira then directs her stern glance at us. Without a word she raises her right hand claw-like to chest height. Magic ripples and entangling vines start to sprout from the ground, trapping the party in place. Onlooking Harpers draw their swords. |\nPlayer: Holy shit. It's really you. The Jaheira.\nJaheira: You have me at a disadvantage. Let me correct that.\nJaheira: Hello.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Harpers draw their weapons.\nPlayer: Please - I've already saved some people imprisoned by Absolute cultists. I'm here to help.\nJaheira: An act of kindness, or a clever decoy. Luckily, I know how to find out which.\nJaheira: This is why we're here, you see.\nNodeContext: Her calm menace continues. She‚Äôs about to make a demonstration.\nJaheira: It is a curious creature that hides all manner of secrets. But if there's one thing that we know -\nNodeContext: Her calm menace continues. She‚Äôs about to make a demonstration.\nJaheira: - it's that it knows its own kind.\n\n| (CINE) Her suspicions now confirmed, Jaheira stows away the jar. The onlooking Harpers eye us with a mixture of fear and hatred. |\nNodeContext: Her calm menace continues. The demonstration is done and she‚Äôs proved her point: we‚Äôre the enemy because we have a tadpole in our heads.\nJaheira: You should never have come here, True Soul.\nNodeContext: Grave. She‚Äôs passing a death sentence on us.\nPlayer: Offer a prayer to your god for salvation.\nJaheira: A pathetic deception - I know who you really worship, True Soul.\nMol: Stop!\n\n| (CINE) Jaheira glances over as a small figure pushes through the Harpers. It's Mol. |\nMol: What are you doing? They're the ones that saved us!\nJaheira: They're the one who protected the Emerald Grove?\nMol: Yup. Didn't leave a goblin standing. Not so bad to hang around with either.\nMol: Saved us from a mad druid and her snakes. A real class act.\nMol: I'd pretty much trust them with my life.\nJaheira: A True Soul with a mind of their own... How is that possible?\nJaheira: How is that possible?\nPlayer: You'll just have to take my word for it.\nJaheira: You sound so confident for someone who's so wrong.\nPlayer: Fine - here. (Show Jaheira the artefact.)\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: | (CINE) The player takes Orpheus from their pocket and presents it to Jaheira who looks on intrigued. There‚Äôs a crackle of energy and she reacts to something in her pocket. She takes out the jar again and we see the tadpole flail wildly inside - then the jar explodes and the tadpole drops to the ground dead. There are gasps from the crowd, and several of the Harpers move in to strike us down. |\nJaheira: What in the hells is that thing?\nPlayer: Tell Jaheira everything you know about the artefact.\nJaheira: Congratulations. You've earned yourself the benefit of the doubt.\nJaheira: Hear me, Harpers! All clear, at ease!\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: | (CINE) Those Harpers who still had their weapons drawn stow them way. The tension among them dissipates now that Jaheira has cleared us. |\nJaheira: I'll not pretend to understand what that artefact is, but I'm old and wise enough to recognise a sliver of hope when it crawls out of the dark.\nJaheira: Tell me - why have you come here?\nPlayer: I'm here on holiday.",

She only seeks the Bhaalian favour you were born to inherit.\nSarevok Anchev: She may have usurped you once, but all her rites and rituals will never match her to your natural gift.\nSarevok Anchev: Bhaal is about to name a new Chosen. All is between you and my granddaughter Orin now, and Orin has much to learn.\nSarevok Anchev: Our lord does not care for beauty. Bhaal cares only for death. Death in numbers. Death in droves.\nSarevok Anchev: It is a lesson Orin will only learn in death. I wonder if you will be the one to teach her?\nPlayer: She has already challenged me herself. We will duel to the death.\nSarevok Anchev: She seeks to sacrifice you in our Father's temple.\nSarevok Anchev: She dreams that your corpse will be her masterpiece, but she forgets - before your incident, you were the true master.\nSarevok Anchev: You were murder. Pure murder. No excesses. No pretentions.\nSarevok Anchev: I believe you will be the one to slay Orin.\nSarevok Anchev: But you will need my help.\nSarevok Anchev: I see you have not embraced your birthright yet. Perhaps with my stewardship,\nFather will bless you yet.\nSarevok Anchev: And when he does, remember grandfather Sarevok. Remember how he helped you. Return to visit him, and tell the blood-drenched tale of your victory.\nSarevok Anchev: Before you may return to our Father's fold, I must first ensure that you remain as pure and worthy of his blessing as you once were.\nSarevok Anchev: So I ask -  why have you brought no offering, child of Bhaal? How am I to lead you in his worship, if you abstain from his most blessed sacrement?\nSarevok Anchev: Come, child of Murder, let me lead you in Bhaal's worship.\nPlayer: I will make Bhaal proud.\nSarevok Anchev: You misunderstand the Lord of Murder. He is not proud. He simply is.\nSarevok Anchev: Let us begin.\nSarevok Anchev: Spirit of the slaughtered - return to us.\nSarevok Anchev: Show us the truth of this murderer's intent, and let us judge them for their bloody service.\nEcho of Amelyssan: His will be done.\n[description] NodeContext: Sarevok stands\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Sarevok reaches out his hand, and clenches it as though grasping something tight. He pulls the hand back towards himself, and a roiling, miasma of dark magic streams from off stage into a large cloud in front of the tribunal\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: the cloud of dark energy clears. The spectre of our previous victim stands before the player. It is confused, scared, and tries to speak, but no noise escapes.\nGROUP_Emperors: Can it be - Belynne herself, reduced to a spectre...\nSarevok Anchev: You took this spirit's life, and thus, its voice. So, speak for it. How was this pitiable creature slain?\nPlayer: First, I ended its sorry existence. Then, I cut the hand from its corpse.",

I've been attempting to get my hands on one for some time now.\nHavkelaag: Would you consider parting with it? The Society's coffers are deep enough to cover any expenses accrued in its retrieval, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: Chk. Don't you dare consider it.\nPlayer: What are you going to do with it?\nHavkelaag: Study it, of course. The githyanki have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months.\nHavkelaag: You are no doubt aware that citizens of the Underdark are held in great suspicion by those who live above ground. Many believe us to be 'evil'.\nHavkelaag: The githyanki face similar prejudice, but I believe, if hatched in a less violent, more intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome its evil predispositions.\nHavkelaag: I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: You assume my people are evil, yet your research is built on sheer superstition.\nHavkelaag: Enough of your kind have wreaked destruction on this plane for me to be confident in my assertion.\nHavkelaag: When I have a suitable sample for my study, I will, however, prove that the effects of their biological inclination are reversible.\nHavkelaag: Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach:\nHavkelaag: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue.\nHavkelaag: Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: You would teach the child virtue, but rear it without patience. Curious.\nHavkelaag: Tell me, then, philosopher - if patience delays the fostering of the other virtues, can it be rightly called virtuous?\nPlayer: Patience does not delay, it simply tempers virtue. Curtails it from excess.\nHavkelaag: A cautious, hesitant instinct. One I am afraid we do not have time for.\nHavkelaag: My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: An experiment like this will only confirm the surface dwellers' suspicion of us.\nHavkelaag: Of course it won't. If anything, it will do quite the opposite. The academic institutions up here will finally be forced to take us seriously.\nHavkelaag: Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg?

Hear its comfort.

She cuts into the human‚Äôs belly, but it‚Äôs a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace.\nMalus Thorm: Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver.\nMalus Thorm: Come. Step forward. You are no sister, but that matters none. Every student is welcome.\nPlayer: In my experience, torture is usually more pain and less proselytising.\nMalus Thorm: Behold, sisters, the very face of ignorance - one who mistakes tenderness for torture.\nMalus Thorm: Go on. Acquaint the face of ignorance with the true object of our studies.\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly.\nMalus Thorm: It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nShadowheart: A stinging truth - but a truth nonetheless.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being?\nMalus Thorm: If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: But you: look how the succour of Shar eludes even you, one who walks faithfully in her shadow. See how painfully present you remain...\nMalus Thorm: We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: Your subject is tainted. Shar's succour must only be granted to the willing.\nMalus Thorm: Hmmm. 'Only the willing may know the Lady's embrace.' You know her teachings well.\nMalus Thorm: And yet, these sisters must exercise their gifts, for the art of absence lies in its execution.\nMalus Thorm: How to proceed, I wonder.\nPlayer: The sisters require a willing volunteer, a master of the art.\nMalus Thorm: I see now.

She cuts into the human‚Äôs belly, but it‚Äôs a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace.\nMalus Thorm: Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver.\nMalus Thorm: Come. Step forward. I can see the love of Shar darken your eyes. Be welcome.\nPlayer: May Shar guide your blessing hands.\nMalus Thorm: And the rough vessels that are yours.\nMalus Thorm: Tell me, what is the guiding principle of the goddess?\nPlayer: Secrecy.\nMalus Thorm: I profess there is another more profound.\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly.\nMalus Thorm: It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nKarlach: What the fuck is this loon talking about.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being?\nMalus Thorm: If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: But you: look how the succour of Shar eludes even you, one who walks faithfully in her shadow. See how painfully present you remain...\nMalus Thorm: We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: Their blades are uneven. Efficient surgery will require further training.\nMalus Thorm: Their incisions are, as yet, still streaked with imprecision - that much I must concede.\nMalus Thorm: How to steady their hands, I wonder.\nPlayer: Sparring is vital to progress. Have them practice on each other.\nPlayer: Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\nMalus Thorm: Yes... For are we not all in need of a cure?\nMalus Thorm: The scalpel does not discriminate. Let each and every one of you partake in its soothing journey.\nMalus Thorm: Absence, sisters. Acquaint yourselves.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) Screaming and slashing, the sisters brutally murder each other.\nMalus Thorm: It is a proud moment when one sees one's teachings so lovingly taken to heart.\nMalus Thorm: You are to be commended for their graduation - rewarded with the promised cure.\nMalus Thorm: Come, I will acquaint you with the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nPlayer: You do me an honour, but I am not worthy. Show me the way of Shar - I beg of you.\nPlayer: I would rather acquaint myself - if you show me how.\nMalus Thorm: Your diligence is exemplary. Very well: your own scalpel you will be.",

What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being?\nMalus Thorm: If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: You are well on your way.

NO. LIKE.\nKlaus: That's a first. Usually I'd allow you in, but in these times I can take no chances.

Don't you dare consider it.\nPlayer: What are you going to do with it?\nHavkelaag: Study it, of course. The githyanki have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months.\nHavkelaag: You yourself have no doubt experienced the prejudice of those who assume that, as beings of the Underdark, we are inherently evil.\nHavkelaag: The githyanki face similar prejudice, but I believe, if hatched in a less violent, more intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome its evil predispositions.\nHavkelaag: I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: You assume my people are evil, yet your research is built on sheer superstition.\nHavkelaag: Enough of your kind have wreaked destruction on this plane for me to be confident in my assertion.\nHavkelaag: When I have a suitable sample for my study, I will, however, prove that the effects of their biological inclination are reversible.\nHavkelaag: Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach:\nHavkelaag: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue.\nHavkelaag: Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: This experiment is exactly the kind of evil you're trying to disprove.\nHavkelaag: The pursuit of knowledge is neither evil nor good. Only in the application of such knowledge should one take on any moral imperative.\nHavkelaag: My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: Your findings are irrelevant, as are the opinions of all on this kaincha plane.\nHavkelaag: Ah. A display of the well-known githyanki arrogance. I am not sure my experiment can cure that particular affliction, but give me time and I will find a way.\nHavkelaag: Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg?

Don't you dare consider it.\nPlayer: What are you going to do with it?\nHavkelaag: Study it, of course. The githyanki have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months.\nHavkelaag: You yourself have no doubt experienced the prejudice of those who assume that, as beings of the Underdark, we are inherently evil.\nHavkelaag: The githyanki face similar prejudice, but I believe, if hatched in a less violent, more intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome its evil predispositions.\nHavkelaag: I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: You assume my people are evil, yet your research is built on sheer superstition.\nHavkelaag: Enough of your kind have wreaked destruction on this plane for me to be confident in my assertion.\nHavkelaag: When I have a suitable sample for my study, I will, however, prove that the effects of their biological inclination are reversible.\nHavkelaag: Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach:\nHavkelaag: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue.\nHavkelaag: Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: Why follow the dogma of a draconic god?\nHavkelaag: In my years of study, they're the closest I've found to moral perfection. Only under such rigorous 'goodness' will the subject stand a chance of being cured.\nHavkelaag: My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: Sounds pointless. Public opinion will hardly be swayed by such a small experiment.\nHavkelaag: Not at first. But if the experiment proves successful, it must be repeated. Only then will we know if the findings are to be trusted.\nHavkelaag: Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg?

Afterwards, I was able to study the parasite that slithered out of the corpse, see what drives these 'True Souls'.\nHalsin: I had no idea anyone beyond their ranks was infected. You have my sincere sympathies.\nPlayer: This magic you mentioned - it isn't normal for these parasites?\nPlayer: What should I do?\nHalsin: I overheard that the cultists are sending all of their captives to Moonrise Towers.\nHalsin: Innocents go in, True Souls come out. Given that all of these True Souls are infected, it has to be the source of this magic.\nHalsin: If you want to find a cure, you must head there and discover how the tadpoles are being manipulated.\nPlayer: At least I know what to do now. Thank you.\nHalsin: Wait - I could help you find a cure... but I need to settle matters here first.\nHalsin: I've no right to ask more of you... but if you could help me, I'd be free to join your journey to Moonrise.\nHalsin: I cannot allow these butchers to threaten my grove.

I had to defend myself.\nHalsin: Then... then it is as you say. They forgot their principles; you had no choice. I will mourn them when I can.\nHalsin: But there are other matters to attend to before that.\nHalsin: Chaos is welcome, in doses; it helps keep balance. But this is too much - this is unnatural.\nHalsin: It's too late to merely kill this horde's leadership - their forces are already marching. If you want me to help, you need to help me first.\nHalsin: You must get ahead of them, muster the defences.\nPlayer: You ask too much of me. I can't help you.",

Onlooking Harpers draw their swords. |\nPlayer: Just this once, I wish people would simply say hello.\nJaheira: Hello.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Harpers draw their weapons.\nPlayer: Please - I've already saved some people imprisoned by Absolute cultists. I'm here to help.\nJaheira: An act of kindness, or a clever decoy. Luckily, I know how to find out which.\nJaheira: This is why we're here, you see.\nNodeContext: Her calm menace continues.

The demonstration is done and she‚Äôs proved her point: we‚Äôre the enemy because we have a tadpole in our heads.\nJaheira: You should never have come here, True Soul.\nNodeContext: Grave. She‚Äôs passing a death sentence on us.\nPlayer: Accept your fate.\nMol: Stop!\n\n| (CINE) Jaheira glances over as a small figure pushes through the Harpers. It's Mol. |\nMol: What are you doing? They're the ones that saved us!\nJaheira: They're the one who protected the Emerald Grove?\nMol: Yup. Didn't leave a goblin standing. Not so bad to hang around with either.\nMol: Saved two of my friends - one from a harpy, and one from a mad druid with a snake. Didn't make a fuss of our thieving, either.\nMol: I'd pretty much trust them with my life.\nJaheira: A True Soul with a mind of their own... How is that possible?\nJaheira: How is that possible?\nPlayer: I suspect this icosahedral artefact is involved. (Show Jaheira.)\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: | (CINE) The player takes Orpheus from their pocket and presents it to Jaheira who looks on intrigued. There‚Äôs a crackle of energy and she reacts to something in her pocket. She takes out the jar again and we see the tadpole flail wildly inside - then the jar explodes and the tadpole drops to the ground dead. There are gasps from the crowd, and several of the Harpers move in to strike us down. |\nJaheira: What in the hells is that thing?\nPlayer: Tell Jaheira everything you know about the artefact.\nJaheira: Congratulations. You've earned yourself the benefit of the doubt.\nJaheira: Hear me, Harpers! All clear, at ease!\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: | (CINE) Those Harpers who still had their weapons drawn stow them way. The tension among them dissipates now that Jaheira has cleared us. |\nJaheira: I'll not pretend to understand why you, the enigma that you are, suddenly crossed our path, but I'm old and wise enough to recognise a sliver of hope when it crawls out of the dark.\nJaheira: Tell me - why have you come here?\nPlayer: I'm here on holiday.",

Regretting it yet?\nWulbren Bongle: I spent a lot of time thinking of worst case scenarios while I was locked in that cell you plucked me out of at Moonrise.\nWulbren Bongle: I didn't imagine anything as bad as this. The Gondians have handed Enver Gortash the means to bring about the end of liberty in Baldur's Gate.\nWulbren Bongle: And the citizens have rolled out the red carpet for their new tyrant.\nWulbren Bongle: Resistance fighters are few and far between - my Ironhands, what's left of the Harpers, and you. I hope.\nPlayer: I'm with you.\nWulbren Bongle: Good. We don't have a chance unless we stick together - not while the Gondians' metal monsters are patrolling the streets.\nWulbren Bongle: The Steel Watch. They're a threat to you, me - and every man, woman and child in the city.\nWulbren Bongle: They act all civilised... servants of the people. But they only serve one man.\nWulbren Bongle: When he becomes Grand Duke, it will only get worse. Laws will change, freedoms will vanish, and soon you'll be accused and sentenced before you've even committed a crime.\nWulbren Bongle: And the fucking Gondians are to blame for all of it.\nPlayer: Cheer up Wulbren. We're here to help.\nWulbren Bongle: I heard about that. You had the Harpers all excited, but there aren't many Harpers left.\nWulbren Bongle: These Steel Watchers. One of them is the equivalent of a red dragon. An army of them, well... there's never been an army of dragons.\nPlayer: I'm not scared of dragons. Or Steel Watchers.\nWulbren Bongle: There's a line where bravery becomes stupidity. You just crossed it.\nWulbren Bongle: Scared or not, you can't take down every Steel Watcher in the city. Unless you hit the people who build them - the Gondians.\nWulbren Bongle: They've always been happy to provide their technology to despots in exchange for a stipend and the freedom to work in peace.\nWulbren Bongle: They would have licked Sarevok's boots given the chance, and now they'll kiss Gortash's ring while the city screams.\nWulbren Bongle: I had a plan to put a stop to them. But the way things are now, if we stick our heads above ground, the Watchers are on us like flies on shit.\nPlayer: Maybe I can help.\nWulbren Bongle: I'm sure you can.\nWulbren Bongle: You just need a little assistance, and I can provide it.\nWulbren Bongle: The Gondians are ingenious. But we're more than equal to them - there's nothing they can build that the Ironhands can't tear down.\nWulbren Bongle: I've built something unique for just that purpose.\nWulbren Bongle: A runepowder bomb - first of its kind. Fifty wizards high on the Weave couldn't summon this kind of firepower.\nWulbren Bongle: Get the bomb inside the Gondian facility, and - boom. Problem solved.\nBarcus Wroot: Wulbren, please. This is too far! Everyone in the foundry would be killed.\nWulbren Bongle: Quiet, Barcus. The adults are talking.\nPlayer: Those metal monsters spit in nature's face, but mass murder is a bit far.\nWulbren Bongle: It's liberation.\nWulbren Bongle: The Gondians picked their side the minute they took orders from Gortash.\nWulbren Bongle: If they had any courage, they'd have refused him and died like heroes, spitting in his face.\nWulbren Bongle: Now they'll die like the dogs they are.\nPlayer: I'm convinced - give me the bomb, and I'll take out the foundry.",

You're aware of the monster inside you. You don't bow to the Absolute, like the True Souls do...\nHalsin: How is this possible...?\nPlayer: I think this artefact has something to do with it.\nHalsin: Hmmm... that looks very alien. As alien as the mind flayers. They do not belong on this world.\nHalsin: You weren't speaking lightly when you said you needed help. Let me tell you what I know.\nHalsin: I've been studying these parasites for a while now. Ever since I discovered these so-called True Souls are infected with them.\nHalsin: Someone is using very powerful magic to modify these tadpoles. They are using them to exert control over the infected.\nHalsin: I'm sorry to say, I can't undo that magic, which means I can't cure you. But that doesn't mean I can't help.\nHalsin: I didn't find what I came here for - a way to remove the tadpoles - but I found the next best thing. I found out where they come from.\nHalsin: That must be where these enchantments are placed on them, and it's where you'll find your cure.\nPlayer: You learned all this from your studies?\nHalsin: Indeed. After we dealt with the drow that ambushed us, Nettie and I were able to inspect the corpse - and the creature that slithered out of it.\nHalsin: I had no idea anyone beyond their ranks was infected. You have my sincere sympathies.\nPlayer: What should I do?\nHalsin: I overheard that the cultists are sending all of their captives to Moonrise Towers.\nHalsin: Innocents go in, True Souls come out. Given that all of these True Souls are infected, it has to be the source of this magic.\nHalsin: If you want to find a cure, you must head there and discover how the tadpoles are being manipulated.\nPlayer: Altered parasites? A cure at Moonrise Towers, maybe? Sounds like guesswork at best.\nHalsin: I'm as certain as I can be. If you have a better alternative, I won't stop you.\nHalsin: I can't stop you, in fact. Which brings me to my next problem...\nHalsin: I've no right to ask more of you... but if you could help me, I'd be free to join your journey to Moonrise.\nHalsin: I cannot allow these butchers to threaten my grove. The natural order must be protected.\nPlayer: Look around you - there's no order anymore. Only chaos.\nHalsin: Chaos is welcome, in doses; it helps keep balance. But this is too much - this is unnatural.\nHalsin: Help me kill the leaders of this horde, save my grove. Then I will help you.\n\nHalsin: Three deaths could win us peace: the drow Minthara, the hobgoblin Dror Ragzlin, and that perversion of a priestess, Gut.\nHalsin: They are the ones holding these parasites together. Remove them and nature will cure itself.\nPlayer: You ask too much of me. I can't help you.",

What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being?\nMalus Thorm: If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: But you: look how the succour of Shar eludes even you, one who walks faithfully in her shadow. See how painfully present you remain...\nMalus Thorm: We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: Their blades are uneven. Efficient surgery will require further training.\nMalus Thorm: Their incisions are, as yet, still streaked with imprecision - that much I must concede.\nMalus Thorm: How to steady their hands, I wonder.\nPlayer: Sparring is vital to progress.

He knows I will stand by him long after all others wilt and fall.\nBalthazar: You, Z'rell, all the rest... you have only one body with which to serve. I have as many as I care to make.\nPlayer: As you mention serving Ketheric, he sent you to find a relic, no?\nBalthazar: General Thorm to you. But yes, recovering the relic is the crux of it. He commands, and I, his humble servant, fulfil that command.\nBalthazar: While you, an infinitely more humble servant, fulfil my command. I will put you to work - as a scout.\nNarrator: *This necromancer has Ketheric's trust. Helping him might just be the best way to gain access to Moonrise Towers.*\nNarrator: *This necromancer has Ketheric's trust. Helping him could be just what you need to gain access to the man himself.*\nPlayer: Jobs like this always go smoother when I know exactly what I'm looking for.\nPlayer: I need more to go on. Why is this relic so important? What does it do?\nBalthazar: Telling you will not make the task any less perilous. Just obey, and use your ignorance as a shield. You should be adept at that already.\nBalthazar: The Nightsong lends the General his strength, his invulnerability. It must be recovered, before his enemies attempt to exploit it.\nPlayer: You need my help?\nBalthazar: I do not need you, or your help. But you are here in spite of that, so I may as well make use of you.\nBalthazar: The Nightsong is close, but the way is barred and Shar's dead are... uncooperative. Clear the path for me - by blade, cunning, or whatever it takes.\nBalthazar: I will remain here until you have succeeded, or fallen.\nShadowheart: I'd trust this gasbag about as far as I can throw him - which isn't far. But perhaps better to play along, for now.\nPlayer: You have resources to spare - give me something to aid my search.\nBalthazar: Fine. I will assign Flesh to aid you on your way. Ring this bell...\nBalthazar: ...and he will come.\nBalthazar: My brother is no intellectual powerhouse, but he is strong, loyal and punctual. Should a fight turn against you, remember the bell.\nPlayer: Actually, I have your mother.\nBalthazar: What the...? Give me back my mother, this instant!\nPlayer: Return Balthazar's mother.\nBalthazar: Good. And keep your hands to yourself in future.\nNodeContext: Cooling down (player has returned the jar containing his dead mother)\nBalthazar: My brother is no intellectual powerhouse, but he is strong, loyal and punctual.

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon‚Äôs voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar.\nMalus Thorm: See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy.\nMalus Thorm: Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human‚Äôs belly, but it‚Äôs a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace.\nMalus Thorm: Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver.\nMalus Thorm: Come. Step forward. You are no sister, but that matters none. Every student is welcome.\nPlayer: You will stop this sick spectacle at once.\nMalus Thorm: Sick. Quite. But on the cusp of a cure:\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly.\nMalus Thorm: It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nKarlach: What the fuck is this loon talking about.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being?\nMalus Thorm: If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: But you: look how the succour of Shar eludes even you, one who walks faithfully in her shadow. See how painfully present you remain...\nMalus Thorm: We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: The sisters aren't ready. They'll make me sick instead of curing me.\nMalus Thorm: Their incisions are, as yet, still streaked with imprecision - that much I must concede.\nMalus Thorm: How to steady their hands, I wonder.\nPlayer: Practice - that's how I got good with a blade. They should spar each other.\nPlayer: Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\nMalus Thorm: Yes... For are we not all in need of a cure?\nMalus Thorm: The scalpel does not discriminate. Let each and every one of you partake in its soothing journey.\nMalus Thorm: Absence, sisters. Acquaint yourselves.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) Screaming and slashing, the sisters brutally murder each other.\nMalus Thorm: It is a proud moment when one sees one's teachings so lovingly taken to heart.\nMalus Thorm: You are to be commended for their graduation - rewarded with the promised cure.\nMalus Thorm: Come, I will acquaint you with the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nPlayer: My magic has blinded me - I see now that Shar is the only path. Show me how - I beg of you.\nPlayer: I would rather acquaint myself - if you show me how.\nMalus Thorm: Your diligence is exemplary. Very well: your own scalpel you will be.",

    "conversation": "[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) We see the Surgeon stand by a table upon which a wriggling human lies strapped down in an X position. Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon‚Äôs voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar.\nMalus Thorm: See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy.\nMalus Thorm: Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human‚Äôs belly, but it‚Äôs a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace.\nMalus Thorm: Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver.\nMalus Thorm: Come. Step forward. I can see the love of Shar darken your eyes. Be welcome.\nPlayer: May Shar guide your blessing hands.\nMalus Thorm: And the rough vessels that are yours.\nMalus Thorm: Tell me, what is the guiding principle of the goddess?\nPlayer: Forgetfulness.\nMalus Thorm: I profess there is another more profound.\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly.\nMalus Thorm: It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nLae'zel: Only a beast of a man toys with his victim. Entertaining, if not efficient.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being?\nMalus Thorm: If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: But you: look how the succour of Shar eludes even you, one who walks faithfully in her shadow. See how painfully present you remain...\nMalus Thorm: We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: Your subject is tainted. Shar's succour must only be granted to the willing.\nMalus Thorm: Hmmm. 'Only the willing may know the Lady's embrace.' You know her teachings well.\nMalus Thorm: And yet, these sisters must exercise their gifts, for the art of absence lies in its execution.\nMalus Thorm: How to proceed, I wonder.\nPlayer: Sparring is vital to progress. Have them practice on each other.\nPlayer: Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\nMalus Thorm: Yes... For are we not all in need of a cure?\nMalus Thorm: The scalpel does not discriminate. Let each and every one of you partake in its soothing journey.\nMalus Thorm: Absence, sisters. Acquaint yourselves.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) Screaming and slashing, the sisters brutally murder each other.\nMalus Thorm: It is a proud moment when one sees one's teachings so lovingly taken to heart.\nMalus Thorm: You are to be commended for their graduation - rewarded with the promised cure.\nMalus Thorm: Come, I will acquaint you with the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nPlayer: I would rather acquaint myself - if you show me how.\nMalus Thorm: Your diligence is exemplary. Very well: your own scalpel you will be.",

Not an entirely unpromising specimen, for one naturally-born.\nNodeContext: Begrudging and largely hostile, but with a hint of appreciation for the player's skill in actually making it this far.\nBalthazar: Not just any True Soul would have succeeded in following my path through this place. You should be pleased.\nBalthazar: I take it the breaking of my skeletons was an accident - the living are so clumsy, after all.\nPlayer: I'm pleased to be of service, Balthazar.\nBalthazar: Perhaps you can prove to me that you're more useful alive than dead. You know what's at stake here, I take it?\nBalthazar: But you're here now, and I may be able to put those limbs to work. You know what's at stake here, I take it?\nPlayer: Z'rell said Ketheric wants you to find a relic. That's all I know.\nPlayer: As you mention serving Ketheric, he sent you to find a relic, no?\nBalthazar: General Thorm to you. But yes, recovering the relic is the crux of it. He commands, and I, his humble servant, fulfil that command.\nBalthazar: While you, an infinitely more humble servant, fulfil my command. I will put you to work - as a scout.\nNarrator: *This necromancer has Ketheric's trust. Helping him might just be the best way to gain access to Moonrise Towers.*\nNarrator: *This necromancer has Ketheric's trust.

Why is this relic so important? What does it do?\nBalthazar: Telling you will not make the task any less perilous. Just obey, and use your ignorance as a shield. You should be adept at that already.\nBalthazar: The Nightsong lends the General his strength, his invulnerability. It must be recovered, before his enemies attempt to exploit it.\nPlayer: You need my help?\nBalthazar: I do not need you, or your help. But you are here in spite of that, so I may as well make use of you.\nBalthazar: The relic is close, but the way is barred and Shar's dead are... uncooperative. Clear the path for me - by blade, cunning, or whatever it takes.\nBalthazar: I will remain here until you have succeeded, or fallen.\nShadowheart: I'd trust this gasbag about as far as I can throw him - which isn't far. But perhaps better to play along, for now.\nPlayer: You have resources to spare - give me something to aid my search.\nBalthazar: Fine. I will assign Flesh to aid you on your way.

We could reshape the world.\nPlayer: I fear we could lose everything if we try to take control.\nNightwarden Minthara: Nothing worthwhile ever came without loss. But together we have the strength to decide who loses. And to make sure it is not us.\nNightwarden Minthara: You are not stupid. When we reach Baldur's Gate and face the other Chosen, you will see that my way is the right one.\nPlayer: You may be right. I'll keep an open mind.\nNightwarden Minthara: That is all I ask. And remember, I know when your mind is closed.\nNightwarden Minthara: We are bound, then, to travel together, even if we do not yet agree on our ultimate purpose.\nNightwarden Minthara: There is yet one thing about you that troubles me, though.

You should be pleased.\nBalthazar: I take it the breaking of my skeletons was an accident - the living are so clumsy, after all.\nPlayer: I'm pleased to be of service, Balthazar.\nBalthazar: Perhaps you can prove to me that you're more useful alive than dead. You know what's at stake here, I take it?\nBalthazar: But you're here now, and I may be able to put those limbs to work. You know what's at stake here, I take it?\nPlayer: Judging by how you're cowering in here, your survival?\nBalthazar: I do not cower - I plan. I command. I create.\nBalthazar: General Thorm trusts me. He knows I will deliver. He knows I will stand by him long after all others wilt and fall.\nBalthazar: You, Z'rell, all the rest... you have only one body with which to serve. I have as many as I care to make.\nPlayer: As you mention serving Ketheric, he sent you to find a relic, no?\nBalthazar: General Thorm to you. But yes, recovering the relic is the crux of it. He commands, and I, his humble servant, fulfil that command.\nBalthazar: While you, an infinitely more humble servant, fulfil my command. I will put you to work - as a scout.\nNarrator: *This necromancer has Ketheric's trust. Helping him might just be the best way to gain access to Moonrise Towers.*\nNarrator: *This necromancer has Ketheric's trust. Helping him could be just what you need to gain access to the man himself.*\nPlayer: A scout is little good if they don't know what to look for. What does this relic do?\nPlayer: I need more to go on. Why is this relic so important? What does it do?\nBalthazar: Telling you will not make the task any less perilous. Just obey, and use your ignorance as a shield. You should be adept at that already.\nBalthazar: The Nightsong lends the General his strength, his invulnerability. It must be recovered, before his enemies attempt to exploit it.\nPlayer: You need my help?\nBalthazar: I do not need you, or your help. But you are here in spite of that, so I may as well make use of you.\nBalthazar: The Nightsong is close, but the way is barred and Shar's dead are... uncooperative. Clear the path for me - by blade, cunning, or whatever it takes.\nBalthazar: I will remain here until you have succeeded, or fallen.\nShadowheart: I'd trust this gasbag about as far as I can throw him - which isn't far. But perhaps better to play along, for now.\nPlayer: For jobs like this it's good form to provide your operatives some extra resources.\nBalthazar: Fine. I will assign Flesh to aid you on your way.

Trading me for some potion?\nAstarion: Because there's something wrong with her blood. I can smell it from here - it's rank.\nPlayer: What do you mean? What's wrong with her blood?\nAstarion: I can't say, it just smells wrong. Unnatural.\nAstarion: Drinking it wouldn't kill me, but it would not be pleasant.\nAraj Oblodra: I don't have all day, True Soul.\nPlayer: Don't do anything you don't want to.\nAstarion: All right.

We're about to unveil your destiny - you should be quivering in anticipation.\nRaphael: Carved into that ivory skin of yours is one part of an infernal contract between the archdevil Mephistopheles and your former master, Cazador Szarr.\nRaphael: In full, the contract states that Cazador will be granted knowledge of an infernal ritual so vile it has never been performed.\nRaphael: The Rite of Profane Ascension.\nRaphael: It promises to be a marvellous ceremony. Very elaborate, incredibly ancient, and entirely diabolical.\nRaphael: If he completes the rite, he will become a new kind of being - the Vampire Ascendant.\nRaphael: All the strengths of his vampiric form will be amplified, and alongside them he will enjoy the luxuries of the living.\nRaphael: The arousals and appetites of man will return to him, and unlike you, he will have no need of a parasite to protect him from the sun.\nRaphael: But the ritual has its price, as all worthwhile things do. Lord Cazador will need to sacrifice a number of souls, including all of his vampiric spawn, if he is to ascend.\nRaphael: Imagine how he felt, then, when one of those precious spawn simply disappeared into thin air.\nRaphael: The only missing ingredient is Astarion.\nRaphael: You are the final piece he requires to complete the ritual - your scars bind you to it. Your soul will set off a very wave of death, bringing Cazador his twisted life.\nRaphael: And that, my tragic and toothsome friend, is that. Now if you'll excuse me, I have business elsewhere.\nNodeContext: [Tarik] snaps fingers at the end of the line.\nAstarion: Hmm...\nPlayer: 'Hmm'? That's all you have to say?\nAstarion: I was... contemplating. It's a lot to take in.\nAstarion: What do you think I should do?\nPlayer: There's a way to become a living vampire... That must mean a lot to you.\nAstarion: The idea definitely has appeal.\nAstarion: I could get rid of the worm in my head and still walk in the sun. I'd finally be free of the hunger.\nAstarion: And if I'm the key to this deal of Cazador's, perhaps I can turn this to my advantage...\nAstarion: I need to take the fight to him.\nAstarion: And I need you to help me.\nPlayer: After we dealt with our tadpole problem, yes, I'll help you then.\nAstarion: Once we deal with the tadpole, I'll be back to my nocturnal self. When you're being hunted by vampires, the dark is the worst place to hide.\nAstarion: I need to deal with Cazador while I still have any kind of advantage over him.\nAstarion: If you won't risk taking him on for my sake, think of the innocent souls he'll sacrifice in this ritual.\nPlayer: You're right - I'll help you destroy him.",

This is his destiny.\nRaphael: As you know already, your precious skin is home to one part of a contract between the archdevil Mephistopheles, and your former master, Cazador Szarr.\nRaphael: In full, the contract states that Cazador will be granted knowledge of an infernal ritual so vile it has never been performed.\nRaphael: The Rite of Profane Ascension.\nRaphael: It promises to be a marvellous ceremony. Very elaborate, incredibly ancient, and entirely diabolical.\nRaphael: If he completes the rite, he will become a new kind of being - the Vampire Ascendant.\nRaphael: All the strengths of his vampiric form will be amplified, and alongside them he will enjoy the luxuries of the living.\nRaphael: The arousals and appetites of man will return to him, and unlike you, he will have no need of a parasite to protect him from the sun.\nRaphael: But the ritual has its price, as all worthwhile things do. Lord Cazador will need to sacrifice a number of souls, including all of his vampiric spawn, if he is to ascend.\nRaphael: Imagine how he felt, then, when one of those precious spawn simply disappeared into thin air.\nRaphael: The only missing ingredient is Astarion.\nRaphael: You are the final piece he requires to complete the ritual - your scars bind you to it. Your soul will set off a very wave of death, bringing Cazador his twisted life.\nRaphael: And that, my tragic and toothsome friend, is that. Now if you'll excuse me, I have business elsewhere.\nNodeContext: [Tarik] snaps fingers at the end of the line.\nAstarion: Hmm...\nPlayer: 'Hmm'? That's all you have to say?\nAstarion: I was... contemplating. It's a lot to take in.\nAstarion: What do you think I should do?\nPlayer: You'll never be free while Cazador lives.\nAstarion: I hate how right you are.\nAstarion: I knew he wouldn't leave me alone even when I was just another wretched toy for him to play with.\nAstarion: But if I'm the key to this power he craves, he'll hunt me to the ends of Faer√ªn.\nAstarion: I need to take the fight to him.\nAstarion: And I need you to help me.\nPlayer: After we dealt with our tadpole problem, yes, I'll help you then.\nAstarion: Once we deal with the tadpole, I'll be back to my nocturnal self. When you're being hunted by vampires, the dark is the worst place to hide.\nAstarion: I need to deal with Cazador while I still have any kind of advantage over him.\nAstarion: If you won't risk taking him on for my sake, think of the innocent souls he'll sacrifice in this ritual.\nPlayer: You're right - I'll help you destroy him.",

We're about to unveil your destiny - you should be quivering in anticipation.\nRaphael: As you know already, your precious skin is home to one part of a contract between the archdevil Mephistopheles, and your former master, Cazador Szarr.\nRaphael: In full, the contract states that Cazador will be granted knowledge of an infernal ritual so vile it has never been performed.\nRaphael: The Rite of Profane Ascension.\nRaphael: It promises to be a marvellous ceremony. Very elaborate, incredibly ancient, and entirely diabolical.\nRaphael: If he completes the rite, he will become a new kind of being - the Vampire Ascendant.\nRaphael: All the strengths of his vampiric form will be amplified, and alongside them he will enjoy the luxuries of the living.\nRaphael: The arousals and appetites of man will return to him, and unlike Astarion, he will have no need of a parasite to protect him from the sun.\nRaphael: But the ritual has its price, as all worthwhile things do.

Now I want what I'm owed - we had a deal.\nRaphael: Indeed we did. I discovered all there is to know about those scars of yours - it's a rather grim tale, even for my tastes.\nPlayer: Stop stalling.\nRaphael: As you wish. Brace yourself, Astarion - we're about to unveil your destiny.\nRaphael: And why would he want to walk away? This is his destiny.\nRaphael: As you know already, your precious skin is home to one part of a contract between the archdevil Mephistopheles, and your former master, Cazador Szarr.\nRaphael: In full, the contract states that Cazador will be granted knowledge of an infernal ritual so vile it has never been performed.\nRaphael: The Rite of Profane Ascension.\nRaphael: It promises to be a marvellous ceremony. Very elaborate, incredibly ancient, and entirely diabolical.\nRaphael: If he completes the rite, he will become a new kind of being - the Vampire Ascendant.\nRaphael: All the strengths of his vampiric form will be amplified, and alongside them he will enjoy the luxuries of the living.\nRaphael: The arousals and appetites of man will return to him, and unlike you, he will have no need of a parasite to protect him from the sun.\nRaphael: But the ritual has its price, as all worthwhile things do. Lord Cazador will need to sacrifice a number of souls, including all of his vampiric spawn, if he is to ascend.\nRaphael: Imagine how he felt, then, when one of those precious spawn simply disappeared into thin air.\nRaphael: The only missing ingredient is Astarion.\nRaphael: You are the final piece he requires to complete the ritual - your scars bind you to it. Your soul will set off a very wave of death, bringing Cazador his twisted life.\nRaphael: And that, my tragic and toothsome friend, is that. Now if you'll excuse me, I have business elsewhere.\nNodeContext: [Tarik] snaps fingers at the end of the line.\nAstarion: Hmm...\nPlayer: 'Hmm'? That's all you have to say?\nAstarion: I was... contemplating. It's a lot to take in.\nAstarion: What do you think I should do?\nPlayer: There's a way to become a living vampire... That must mean a lot to you.\nAstarion: The idea definitely has appeal.\nAstarion: I could get rid of the worm in my head and still walk in the sun. I'd finally be free of the hunger.\nAstarion: And if I'm the key to this deal of Cazador's, perhaps I can turn this to my advantage...\nAstarion: I need to take the fight to him.\nAstarion: And I need you to help me.\nPlayer: If he comes for you, I'll defend you. But we're not risking an attack on his lair.\nAstarion: If you won't risk taking him on for my sake, think of the innocent souls he'll sacrifice in this ritual.\nPlayer: You're right - I'll help you destroy him.",

A Kara-Tur warlord once tried the same - I made him watch as I ate his concubines and young, then fashioned a codpiece from his skull.\nYurgir: You can't help. It's not just walls that keep me here. Not the traps, the dark or the creatures it hides. Something stronger holds me - a contract.\nYurgir: Either I fulfil the contract, die trying... or forfeit my freedom. If I leave this place now, I'll become Raphael's slave.\nPlayer: Raphael is a devil like all your kind - he deals in tricks. You probably missed a loophole in your contract.\nYurgir: Raphael is no foolish story-devil, his mind is different. Sneaky.

Then he's due our congratulations before we butcher him.\nPlayer: Raphael wanted you to kill Dark Justiciars? Why?\nYurgir: Asking why doesn't get me paid - hunting and killing does.

Now I want what I'm owed - we had a deal.\nRaphael: Indeed we did. I discovered all there is to know about those scars of yours - it's a rather grim tale, even for my tastes.\nPlayer: Please, give me more boring details about your plans.\nRaphael: Come now, we're about to unveil your destiny - you should be quivering in anticipation.\n\nRaphael: And why would he want to walk away? This is his destiny.\nRaphael: As you know already, your precious skin is home to one part of a contract between the archdevil Mephistopheles, and your former master, Cazador Szarr.\nRaphael: In full, the contract states that Cazador will be granted knowledge of an infernal ritual so vile it has never been performed.\nRaphael: The Rite of Profane Ascension.\nRaphael: It promises to be a marvellous ceremony. Very elaborate, incredibly ancient, and entirely diabolical.\nRaphael: If he completes the rite, he will become a new kind of being - the Vampire Ascendant.\nRaphael: All the strengths of his vampiric form will be amplified, and alongside them he will enjoy the luxuries of the living.\nRaphael: The arousals and appetites of man will return to him, and unlike you, he will have no need of a parasite to protect him from the sun.\nRaphael: But the ritual has its price, as all worthwhile things do. Lord Cazador will need to sacrifice a number of souls, including all of his vampiric spawn, if he is to ascend.\nRaphael: Imagine how he felt, then, when one of those precious spawn simply disappeared into thin air.\nRaphael: The only missing ingredient is Astarion.\nRaphael: You are the final piece he requires to complete the ritual - your scars bind you to it. Your soul will set off a very wave of death, bringing Cazador his twisted life.\nRaphael: And that, my tragic and toothsome friend, is that. Now if you'll excuse me, I have business elsewhere.\nNodeContext: [Tarik] snaps fingers at the end of the line.\nAstarion: Hmm...\nPlayer: You don't need to go back to Cazador - you're with me now.\nAstarion: Do you think it's so simple?\nAstarion: What do you think I should do?\nPlayer: There's a way to become a living vampire... That must mean a lot to you.\nAstarion: The idea definitely has appeal.\nAstarion: I could get rid of the worm in my head and still walk in the sun. I'd finally be free of the hunger.\nAstarion: And if I'm the key to this deal of Cazador's, perhaps I can turn this to my advantage...\nAstarion: I need to take the fight to him.\nAstarion: And I need you to help me.\nPlayer: If he comes for you, I'll defend you. But we're not risking an attack on his lair.\nAstarion: If you won't risk taking him on for my sake, think of the innocent souls he'll sacrifice in this ritual.\nPlayer: You're right - I'll help you destroy him.",

Maybe it's best left in the past.\nAstarion: Even if I wanted to walk away from all of this, I can't. Cazador won't let me.\nRaphael: And why would he want to walk away? This is his destiny.\nRaphael: As you know already, your precious skin is home to one part of a contract between the archdevil Mephistopheles, and your former master, Cazador Szarr.\nRaphael: In full, the contract states that Cazador will be granted knowledge of an infernal ritual so vile it has never been performed.\nRaphael: The Rite of Profane Ascension.\nRaphael: It promises to be a marvellous ceremony. Very elaborate, incredibly ancient, and entirely diabolical.\nRaphael: If he completes the rite, he will become a new kind of being - the Vampire Ascendant.\nRaphael: All the strengths of his vampiric form will be amplified, and alongside them he will enjoy the luxuries of the living.\nRaphael: The arousals and appetites of man will return to him, and unlike you, he will have no need of a parasite to protect him from the sun.\nRaphael: But the ritual has its price, as all worthwhile things do. Lord Cazador will need to sacrifice a number of souls, including all of his vampiric spawn, if he is to ascend.\nRaphael: Imagine how he felt, then, when one of those precious spawn simply disappeared into thin air.\nRaphael: The only missing ingredient is Astarion.\nRaphael: You are the final piece he requires to complete the ritual - your scars bind you to it. Your soul will set off a very wave of death, bringing Cazador his twisted life.\nRaphael: And that, my tragic and toothsome friend, is that. Now if you'll excuse me, I have business elsewhere.\nNodeContext: [Tarik] snaps fingers at the end of the line.\nAstarion: Hmm...\nPlayer: Cazador is a piece of shit. We're going to stop him.\nAstarion: Do you think it's so simple?\nAstarion: What do you think I should do?\nPlayer: You'll never be free while Cazador lives.\nAstarion: I hate how right you are.\nAstarion: I knew he wouldn't leave me alone even when I was just another wretched toy for him to play with.\nAstarion: But if I'm the key to this power he craves, he'll hunt me to the ends of Faer√ªn.\nAstarion: I need to take the fight to him.\nAstarion: And I need you to help me.\nPlayer: After we dealt with our tadpole problem, yes, I'll help you then.\nAstarion: Once we deal with the tadpole, I'll be back to my nocturnal self. When you're being hunted by vampires, the dark is the worst place to hide.\nAstarion: I need to deal with Cazador while I still have any kind of advantage over him.\nAstarion: If you won't risk taking him on for my sake, think of the innocent souls he'll sacrifice in this ritual.\nPlayer: You're right - I'll help you destroy him.",

That must mean a lot to you.\nAstarion: The idea definitely has appeal.\nAstarion: I could get rid of the worm in my head and still walk in the sun.

I can't.\nPlayer: But I don't have symptoms - I'm not changing.\nNettie: Same as the drow... But Master Halsin said he'd turn eventually.\nPlayer: Eventually? That gives me time to find a cure.\nNettie: Maybe, but it's one hell of a maybe. You could have days or seconds.\nPlayer: Recite what you know of her order - this can't be allowed!\nPlayer: As long as there's a chance, you're not saving me.

Before you realise what's happening, you feel a burning scratch on your hand.*\nNettie: There. It's done.\nNettie: I'm truly, truly sorry. For what it's worth, the poison is painless. It'll be like going to sleep.\nPlayer: Grab the branch and try to identify the poison.\nNarrator: *Not many thorns have such unique poison - it has to be Kelemvor's Kiss, a plant from the Dalelands. There is a cure but, try as you might, you can't recall it.*\nPlayer: Give me the antidote. I know you have one.\nNettie: I won't. I can't.\nPlayer: But I don't have symptoms - I'm not changing.\nNettie: Same as the drow... But Master Halsin said he'd turn eventually.\nPlayer: Eventually? That gives me time to find a cure.\nNettie: Maybe, but it's one hell of a maybe. You could have days or seconds.\nPlayer: As long as there's a chance, you're not saving me. You're committing murder.\nNettie: I'm sorry. There's nothing you can say to change my mind.\nPlayer: Attack her.",

And I will smile.\nPlayer: Is vengeance the limit of your ambitions?\nNightwarden Minthara: There is no limit to my ambitions. I will enjoy killing Orin, but unlike her, I do not kill for pleasure alone. I kill to gain advantage.\nNightwarden Minthara: And we have the chance to seize the greatest advantage of all. Surely you see it?\nNightwarden Minthara: In killing Ketheric, we fractured the cult's leadership. When we break the other Chosen and claim their Netherstones, we can take control.\nPlayer: A bold gamble. How can you be sure it's possible?\nNightwarden Minthara: I would have thought this entire conspiracy of gods and monsters to be impossible if I had not seen it for myself.\nNightwarden Minthara: We may fail, but we must try.\nNightwarden Minthara: The power of the enslaved elder brain could reshape the world.

I shall walk that path with you.\nPlayer: I hoped you would - we make a good team.\nPlayer: And I'll never tire of killing their previous occupants. We make a good team.\nNightwarden Minthara: My blood ran hot when we broke Ketheric's bones together. But we have greater challenges ahead of us.\nNightwarden Minthara: It is clear, now, that he was not working alone.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Leaves throne, standing from here on\nNightwarden Minthara: During my time in the cult, I came to know one of his co-conspirators all too well - Bhaal's blood-letter, Orin.\nNightwarden Minthara: I know one of them all too well - Bhaal's blood-letter, Orin.\nNightwarden Minthara: To think I thought her to be speaking for the Absolute. I worshipped that woman.\nPlayer: First Myrkul, now Bhaal - I feel like we're in over our heads.\nNightwarden Minthara: If the gods stand in our way, we will tear them down. Nothing will deny me my vengeance on Orin.\nNightwarden Minthara: She is the iblith who indoctrinated me with the Absolute's lies.\nNightwarden Minthara: Indeed, she is the one who indoctrinated me with the Absolute's lies.\nPlayer: What can you tell me about Orin?\nNightwarden Minthara: She is fierce, vicious, and cruel. In those respects, we are alike - but she is dangerously unpredictable.\nNightwarden Minthara: If there is a way to turn this design toward slaughter rather than control, she will take it.\nNightwarden Minthara: She is the one who brought me to Moonrise, and into the presence of her so-called god - the Absolute.\nNightwarden Minthara: Now I know that those memories are lies.\nNightwarden Minthara: There was no god. Orin held me down in a cocoon of flesh, while a mind flayer forced a parasite into my brain. And she laughed at my fear.\nNightwarden Minthara: I will find her, I will murder her. And I will smile.\nPlayer: We'll be heroes - the saviours of Baldur's Gate.\nNightwarden Minthara: Let them think that. There is a short path from saviour to ruler - a short and bloody path. I know it well, and we will walk it together.\nNightwarden Minthara: But Baldur's Gate is a mere bauble. We have the chance to seize something much greater. Surely you see it?\nNightwarden Minthara: In killing Ketheric, we fractured the cult's leadership. When we break the other Chosen and claim their Netherstones, we can take control.\nPlayer: Madness. We need to eradicate the cult and the elder brain.\nNightwarden Minthara: Madness would be to let the Absolute's potential go to waste.\nNightwarden Minthara: The power of the enslaved elder brain could reshape the world. We could reshape the world.\nPlayer: It's going to be glorious - I can hardly wait.",

Surely you see it?\nNightwarden Minthara: In killing Ketheric, we fractured the cult's leadership. When we break the other Chosen and claim their Netherstones, we can take control.\nPlayer: What would we do with that power?\nNightwarden Minthara: The power of the enslaved elder brain could reshape the world.

Trading me for some potion?\nAstarion: Because there's something wrong with her blood. I can smell it from here - it's rank.\nPlayer: Her house, Oblodra, was infamous for experimenting with mind flayers. Could her blood be tainted somehow?\nAstarion: That would explain the stench, yes.\nAstarion: I already have enough illithid filth in my head - I don't want it in my stomach as well.\nAraj Oblodra: I don't have all day, True Soul.\nPlayer: Don't do anything you don't want to.\nAstarion: All right.
