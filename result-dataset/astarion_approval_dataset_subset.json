I never expected this.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: I'll tell you what I know.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: A century ago, there was a man - Sarevok Anchev. He was a child of the god of murder, Bhaal.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: He ruled the Iron Throne - a dark tower hiding a darker secret. It was the front for a deadly arms-dealing network.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: There, Sarevok amassed an army and sought to become a god. Under his stewardship, the Bhaal Temple was revived, and with it, the Bhaal cult itself.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: Fortunately, the Temple was destroyed, and to cleanse the city of Sarevok's memory, the Iron Throne was torn from its foundations and cast into the Chionthar.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: For most, that was the end of it. But cults like that don't disappear overnight. This list you brought me confirms I'm right.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: The Bhaal cult is back, and someone is out there, continuing Sarevok's work.\nPlayer: You should raise this with your superiors, immediately.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: Don't you think I've tried?

I never expected this.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: I'll tell you what I know.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: A century ago, there was a man - Sarevok Anchev. He was a child of the god of murder, Bhaal.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: He ruled the Iron Throne - a dark tower hiding a darker secret. It was the front for a deadly arms-dealing network.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: There, Sarevok amassed an army and sought to become a god. Under his stewardship, the Bhaal Temple was revived, and with it, the Bhaal cult itself.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: Fortunately, the Temple was destroyed, and to cleanse the city of Sarevok's memory, the Iron Throne was torn from its foundations and cast into the Chionthar.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: For most, that was the end of it. But cults like that don't disappear overnight. This list you brought me confirms I'm right.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: The Bhaal cult is back, and someone is out there, continuing Sarevok's work.\nPlayer: What makes you think it's not Sarevok himself?\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: I've not ruled out the possibility that it is Sarevok himself.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: The brutality of the killings is certainly reminiscent of his work. But there's something more here, something new...\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: There's a reverence to these murders, a certain flair. It's as if they were done in worship.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: The precision of the cuts, the depth, the execution - the best butchers in Faerûn couldn't make a cut like that. Trust me, I've asked them.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: I tried to explain all this to my superiors, but they wouldn't have any of it.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: They told me to drop it.

Have you found anything?\nPlayer: Recount your investigation into Father Lorgan's murder, and show her the list you found.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: Gods... This is it. The proof that I was right!\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: I've been working on an assignment, see - a research project of sorts. I knew my conclusions were sound, but this... I never expected this.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: I'll tell you what I know.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: A century ago, there was a man - Sarevok Anchev. He was a child of the god of murder, Bhaal.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: He ruled the Iron Throne - a dark tower hiding a darker secret. It was the front for a deadly arms-dealing network.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: There, Sarevok amassed an army and sought to become a god. Under his stewardship, the Bhaal Temple was revived, and with it, the Bhaal cult itself.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: Fortunately, the Temple was destroyed, and to cleanse the city of Sarevok's memory, the Iron Throne was torn from its foundations and cast into the Chionthar.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: For most, that was the end of it. But cults like that don't disappear overnight. This list you brought me confirms I'm right.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: The Bhaal cult is back, and someone is out there, continuing Sarevok's work.\nPlayer: You're absolutely right. I have reasons of my own to think there's been an increase in Bhaalist activity.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: Good. Then your eyes are open to the truth.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: The brutality of the killings is on a par with Sarevok's own. But there's something more here, something new...\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: There's a reverence to these murders, a certain flair. It's as if they were done in worship.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: The precision of the cuts, the depth, the execution - the best butchers in Faerûn couldn't make a cut like that. Trust me, I've asked them.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: I've done everything I can within the remit of my job. Any more, and they'll fire me.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: But you - you're not bound by such constraints. Help me out, here. Help the city out.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: I'll bet if you follow the trail of these murders, you'll be able to unearth the truth of this resurgence.\nPlayer: I'll do my best.",

Remind them how much worse things could be. What do you say?\nGROUP_Act3_WYR_OrinsImpersonation_FlamingFist: We need to march round the front, and kill every last one of them.

I never expected this.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: I'll tell you what I know.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: A century ago, there was a man - Sarevok Anchev. He was a child of the god of murder, Bhaal.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: He ruled the Iron Throne - a dark tower hiding a darker secret. It was the front for a deadly arms-dealing network.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: There, Sarevok amassed an army and sought to become a god. Under his stewardship, the Bhaal Temple was revived, and with it, the Bhaal cult itself.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: Fortunately, the Temple was destroyed, and to cleanse the city of Sarevok's memory, the Iron Throne was torn from its foundations and cast into the Chionthar.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: For most, that was the end of it. But cults like that don't disappear overnight. That list you spoke of confirms I'm right.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: The Bhaal cult is back, and someone is out there, continuing Sarevok's work.\nPlayer: What makes you think it's not Sarevok himself?\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: I've not ruled out the possibility that it is Sarevok himself.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: The brutality of the killings is certainly reminiscent of his work.

It's as if they were done in worship.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: The precision of the cuts, the depth, the execution - the best butchers in Faerûn couldn't make a cut like that.

Usually I'd allow you in, but in these times I can take no chances. Move along - no circus for you.\nNarrator: *You feel your patron bristle with a thousand briars at the rejection.

I worshipped that woman.\nPlayer: When I murder her, Bhaal will choose me in her place.\nNightwarden Minthara: I would prefer to put my faith in your strength than the favour of your god. After all, it is Orin and this grand deception that he chose - not you.\nNightwarden Minthara: He favours her, and she is one of the founders of this insane cult.\nNightwarden Minthara: Indeed, she is the one who indoctrinated me with the Absolute's lies.\nPlayer: What can you tell me about Orin?\nNightwarden Minthara: She is fierce, vicious, and cruel. In those respects, we are alike - but she is dangerously unpredictable.\nNightwarden Minthara: If there is a way to turn this design toward slaughter rather than control, she will take it.\nNightwarden Minthara: She is the one who brought me to Moonrise, and into the presence of her so-called god - the Absolute.\nNightwarden Minthara: Now I know that those memories are lies.\nNightwarden Minthara: There was no god. Orin held me down in a cocoon of flesh, while a mind flayer forced a parasite into my brain. And she laughed at my fear.\nNightwarden Minthara: I will find her, I will murder her.
