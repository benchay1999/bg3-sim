Now you stand before him, once again. Sarevok Anchev.*\nSarevok Anchev: Harper worm... the abdicating hero... your keen sense for this city has withered in your absence.\nSarevok Anchev: And you... Man of Stone. As you stood a statue, a helpless ornament, your city warped. Changed. Became ripe for the plucking.\nJaheira: Sarevok, Bhaal's least favourite son. Still tied to daddy's apron strings, I see.\nSarevok Anchev: You disappoint me, child of Murder. I expected more of your return.\nNarrator: *Sarevok Anchev. A relic of your cursed line, a Bhaalspawn who failed to become Chosen.*\nNarrator: *And yet, the history he shares with your companion seems to run almost as deep as your own.*\nNarrator: *The history they share may be long gone, but the threat of violence between them is as fresh as newly spilled blood - neither party will let the other walk out of here alive.*\nSarevok Anchev: What purpose do you have in bringing these heretics to the court of Bhaal? Speak, or death will be your final word.\nPlayer: We're not here to dig up old feuds. I seek a path to the Temple of Bhaal.\nSarevok Anchev: You speak of the past - I speak of the future. Well, aspirant? Do the shades of yesterday speak for you, too?\nSarevok Anchev: There are two paths to the Temple of Bhaal: to carve your devotion into flesh, or to be the carcass that is carved upon.\nPlayer: I answer for myself, Sarevok - and Minsc answers to me. He won't be a problem.\nJaheira: You make promises that aren't yours to keep. Take care that their breaking does not break something more.\nMinsc: If Minsc is certain of one thing, it is that he very much plans on being a problem for Sarevok.\nSarevok Anchev: I know this one well. I have travelled in his company. Whatever else may be said of him, he answers to no one but Boo.\nSarevok Anchev: It seems there is some disagreement on who is master here.\nPlayer: Fine, Sarevok. If she won't obey - take her as my offering instead.",

Her hands are in a prayer position and she's chanting softly as the moonlight dances around her. She exhales, then inhales and breaths in tendrils of shadow, absorbing them. She swallows, then begins hacking coughing. The moonlight dissipates. She quickly goes from seeming like a divine spirit to a normal young woman.\nIsobel: I didn't realise I had an audience.\nFist Marcus: Isobel. This is -\nIsobel: A Sharran.\nNarrator: *Isobel. The same name as Ketheric Thorm's daughter - the one whose sarcophagus you found empty in the family mausoleum.*\nPlayer: Push your Urges down.\nPlayer: Let's not let an ancient squabble interfere with the task at hand.\nIsobel: Not as ancient as you think.\nIsobel: Frankly, I'm surprised you're willing to help us. Your kind aren't known for their decency - particularly when a Sharran curse is our greatest obstacle.\nIsobel: But if you are who I think you are, I'd be a fool to reject your help. The True Soul with... well, a soul. Imagine.\nPlayer: I'm glad you've remembered who needs whose help here.\nIsobel: Oh - aren't you looking for a protection spell?\nPlayer: I am already protected. My Lady shields me from the curse.\nIsobel: For now, perhaps. But Shar can be fickle, and her love can prove fleeting. Do not turn your back on an advantage you may need... even a Selûnite one.\nIsobel: If nothing else, it can aid any companions who travel with you - somehow I doubt Shar's largesse was extended to them.\nPlayer: It was nothing. Put it out of your mind.\nNarrator: *But was it truly nothing? The pain gripped you tight, robbing you of all composure for a moment...*\nIsobel: Well! If the Moonmaiden didn't strike me dead for blessing you, she must rather approve of this little alliance.\nIsobel: This will block the lesser effects of the shadow curse, allowing you to traverse the darkness outside... should Shar's own protection falter, that is.\nIsobel: Curious. Surely the Nightsinger could have shielded all her followers, and made this place her domain long ago... yet she only acts now, and aids you alone. I wonder why.\nPlayer: The Dark Lady's works aren't for me to question.\nIsobel: Mustn't question the great shadow mother, must we?\nIsobel: I'll stop needling you, though. You have more important things to do, after all.\nPlayer: I've already been to Moonrise, but I have more work to do indeed.\nIsobel: I imagine so, if Jaheira hasn't gone tearing off into the night.\nPlayer: You're coming with me, cleric.",

Or Nessus, the seat of infernal power.\nPlayer: Nessus, where the Hells' overlord reigns supreme.\nNarrator: *You are flush with untold power. You could rip apart mountains and bring gods to their knees.

She quickly goes from seeming like a divine spirit to a normal young woman.\nIsobel: I didn't realise I had an audience.\nFist Marcus: Isobel. This is -\nIsobel: A Sharran.\nNarrator: *Isobel.

If the Moonmaiden didn't strike me dead for blessing you, she must rather approve of this little alliance.\nIsobel: This will block the lesser effects of the shadow curse, allowing you to traverse the darkness outside... should Shar's own protection falter, that is.\nIsobel: Curious. Surely the Nightsinger could have shielded all her followers, and made this place her domain long ago... yet she only acts now, and aids you alone.

I hope never to meet the wicked man who haemorrhaged shadows over this peaceful village. I've heard you might be the person to stop him.\nIsobel: A True Soul with a soul. Imagine.\nIsobel: But if you are who I think you are, I'd be a fool to reject your help. The True Soul with... well, a soul. Imagine.\nPlayer: I'm glad you've remembered who needs whose help here.\nIsobel: Oh - aren't you looking for a protection spell?\nPlayer: I need nothing from a Selûnite.\nIsobel: But any others who travel with you may not agree. Do it for them at least - you will need all the help you can get out there.\nPlayer: Ngh... it hurts...\nIsobel: Well! If the Moonmaiden didn't strike me dead for blessing you, she must rather approve of this little alliance.\nIsobel: This will block the lesser effects of the shadow curse, allowing you to traverse the darkness outside... should Shar's own protection falter, that is.\nIsobel: Curious. Surely the Nightsinger could have shielded all her followers, and made this place her domain long ago... yet she only acts now, and aids you alone. I wonder why.\nPlayer: I don't know what to make of it myself.\nIsobel: I suppose Shar is nothing if not mysterious.\nIsobel: I'll stop needling you, though. You have more important things to do, after all.\nPlayer: I've already been to Moonrise, but I have more work to do indeed.\nIsobel: I imagine so, if Jaheira hasn't gone tearing off into the night.\nPlayer: You're coming with me, cleric.",

You mean you have one of them?\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Halsin raises a hand to your head, magically connecting with you (no contact). He gives an alarmed look - he knows what’s inside you\nHalsin: Oak Father preserve you, child... You're infected, aren't you? The mind flayers' spawn.\nHalsin: But... something's different. You're aware of the monster inside you. You don't bow to the Absolute, like the True Souls do...\nHalsin: How is this possible...?\nPlayer: I don't know.\nHalsin: You weren't speaking lightly when you said you needed help. Let me tell you what I know.\nHalsin: I've been studying these parasites for a while now. Ever since I discovered these so-called True Souls are infected with them.\nHalsin: Someone is using very powerful magic to modify these tadpoles. They are using them to exert control over the infected.\nHalsin: I'm sorry to say, I can't undo that magic, which means I can't cure you. But that doesn't mean I can't help.\nHalsin: I didn't find what I came here for - a way to remove the tadpoles - but I found the next best thing. I found out where they come from.\nHalsin: That must be where these enchantments are placed on them, and it's where you'll find your cure.\nPlayer: So all of this was for nothing.\nHalsin: Patience. I can't just snap my fingers... but I know where the solution almost certainly lies.\nHalsin: I overheard that the cultists are sending all of their captives to Moonrise Towers.\nHalsin: Innocents go in, True Souls come out. Given that all of these True Souls are infected, it has to be the source of this magic.\nHalsin: If you want to find a cure, you must head there and discover how the tadpoles are being manipulated.\nPlayer: You seem to know a lot about this. Will you come with me to Moonrise?\nHalsin: I wish I could, but there's still work I've yet to finish - blood I've yet to spill.\nHalsin: I've no right to ask more of you... but if you could help me, I'd be free to join your journey to Moonrise.\nHalsin: I cannot allow these butchers to threaten my grove. The natural order must be protected.\nPlayer: Kagha is dead. She was swayed by Shadow Druids. I had no choice.\nHalsin: Kagha... This is my fault - I was her teacher. I will mourn her when I can.\nHalsin: But there are other matters to attend to before that.\nHalsin: Chaos is welcome, in doses; it helps keep balance. But this is too much - this is unnatural.\nHalsin: Help me kill the leaders of this horde, save my grove. Then I will help you.\n\nHalsin: Three deaths could win us peace: the drow Minthara, the hobgoblin Dror Ragzlin, and that perversion of a priestess, Gut.\nHalsin: They are the ones holding these parasites together. Remove them and nature will cure itself.\nPlayer: You ask too much of me. I can't help you.",

I found out where they come from.\nHalsin: That must be where these enchantments are placed on them, and it's where you'll find your cure.\nPlayer: You learned all this from your studies?\nHalsin: Indeed. After we dealt with the drow that ambushed us, Nettie and I were able to inspect the corpse - and the creature that slithered out of it.\nHalsin: I had no idea anyone beyond their ranks was infected. You have my sincere sympathies.\nPlayer: Sympathies won't help me to survive.\nHalsin: Patience. I can't just snap my fingers... but I know where the solution almost certainly lies.\nHalsin: I overheard that the cultists are sending all of their captives to Moonrise Towers.\nHalsin: Innocents go in, True Souls come out. Given that all of these True Souls are infected, it has to be the source of this magic.\nHalsin: If you want to find a cure, you must head there and discover how the tadpoles are being manipulated.\nPlayer: At least I know what to do now. Thank you.\nHalsin: Wait - I could help you find a cure... but I need to settle matters here first.\nHalsin: I've no right to ask more of you... but if you could help me, I'd be free to join your journey to Moonrise.\nHalsin: I cannot allow these butchers to threaten my grove.

One should cherish all of nature's bounty... but goblin guts are quite far down the list.\nNodeContext: Hint of wry humour, Introducing himself after transforming from an owlbear and killing several goblins.\nHalsin: Not only do you speak with a bear, but you free it, too? A true friend of nature - or perhaps a lunatic.\nHalsin: Either way, I owe thanks. I am the druid Halsin.\nPlayer: Glad I could be of help.\nHalsin: I must admit, I didn't expect anyone would come to my aid. Who in their right mind would infiltrate a goblin infested temple. Unless...\nHalsin: ...Hrrm. That look in your eyes - I've seen it before. Are you feeling all right?\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Halsin raises a hand to your head, magically connecting with you (no contact). He gives an alarmed look - he knows what’s inside you\nHalsin: Oak Father preserve you, child... You're infected, aren't you? The mind flayers' spawn.\nHalsin: But... something's different. You're aware of the monster inside you. You don't bow to the Absolute, like the True Souls do...\nHalsin: How is this possible...?\nPlayer: I don't know.\nHalsin: You weren't speaking lightly when you said you needed help. Let me tell you what I know.\nHalsin: I've been studying these parasites for a while now. Ever since I discovered these so-called True Souls are infected with them.\nHalsin: Someone is using very powerful magic to modify these tadpoles. They are using them to exert control over the infected.\nHalsin: I'm sorry to say, I can't undo that magic, which means I can't cure you. But that doesn't mean I can't help.\nHalsin: I didn't find what I came here for - a way to remove the tadpoles - but I found the next best thing. I found out where they come from.\nHalsin: That must be where these enchantments are placed on them, and it's where you'll find your cure.\nPlayer: How did you come to study mind flayer parasites?\nHalsin: A drow forced me to defend myself. Afterwards, I was able to study the parasite that slithered out of the corpse, see what drives these 'True Souls'.\nHalsin: I had no idea anyone beyond their ranks was infected. You have my sincere sympathies.\nPlayer: Sympathies won't help me to survive.\nHalsin: Patience. I can't just snap my fingers... but I know where the solution almost certainly lies.\nHalsin: I overheard that the cultists are sending all of their captives to Moonrise Towers.\nHalsin: Innocents go in, True Souls come out. Given that all of these True Souls are infected, it has to be the source of this magic.\nHalsin: If you want to find a cure, you must head there and discover how the tadpoles are being manipulated.\nPlayer: At least I know what to do now. Thank you.\nHalsin: Wait - I could help you find a cure... but I need to settle matters here first.\nHalsin: I've no right to ask more of you... but if you could help me, I'd be free to join your journey to Moonrise.\nHalsin: I cannot allow these butchers to threaten my grove. The natural order must be protected.\nPlayer: The other druids are dead, by my hand.\nHalsin: What...? How? Why?! Explain yourself at once!\nPlayer: They left me no choice. I had to defend myself.\nHalsin: Then... then it is as you say. They forgot their principles; you had no choice. I will mourn them when I can.\nHalsin: But there are other matters to attend to before that.\nHalsin: Chaos is welcome, in doses; it helps keep balance. But this is too much - this is unnatural.\nHalsin: It's too late to merely kill this horde's leadership - their forces are already marching. If you want me to help, you need to help me first.\nHalsin: You must get ahead of them, muster the defences.\nPlayer: You ask too much of me. I can't help you.",

She quickly goes from seeming like a divine spirit to a normal young woman.\nIsobel: I didn't realise I had an audience.\nFist Marcus: Isobel. This is -\nIsobel: A Sharran.\nNarrator: *Isobel.

If the Moonmaiden didn't strike me dead for blessing you, she must rather approve of this little alliance.\nIsobel: This will block the lesser effects of the shadow curse, allowing you to traverse the darkness outside... should Shar's own protection falter, that is.\nIsobel: Curious. Surely the Nightsinger could have shielded all her followers, and made this place her domain long ago... yet she only acts now, and aids you alone. I wonder why.\nPlayer: The Dark Lady's works aren't for me to question.\nIsobel: Mustn't question the great shadow mother, must we?\nIsobel: I'll stop needling you, though.

You're aware of the monster inside you. You don't bow to the Absolute, like the True Souls do...\nHalsin: How is this possible...?\nPlayer: I escaped from an illithid ship after being infected. Maybe the process was interrupted.\nHalsin: Perhaps... but I wouldn't want to place all my faith in blind luck.\nHalsin: You weren't speaking lightly when you said you needed help. Let me tell you what I know.\nHalsin: I've been studying these parasites for a while now. Ever since I discovered these so-called True Souls are infected with them.\nHalsin: Someone is using very powerful magic to modify these tadpoles. They are using them to exert control over the infected.\nHalsin: I'm sorry to say, I can't undo that magic, which means I can't cure you. But that doesn't mean I can't help.\nHalsin: I didn't find what I came here for - a way to remove the tadpoles - but I found the next best thing. I found out where they come from.\nHalsin: That must be where these enchantments are placed on them, and it's where you'll find your cure.\nPlayer: How did you come to study mind flayer parasites?\nHalsin: A drow forced me to defend myself. Afterwards, I was able to study the parasite that slithered out of the corpse, see what drives these 'True Souls'.\nHalsin: I had no idea anyone beyond their ranks was infected. You have my sincere sympathies.\nPlayer: Sympathies won't help me to survive.\nHalsin: Patience. I can't just snap my fingers... but I know where the solution almost certainly lies.\nHalsin: I overheard that the cultists are sending all of their captives to Moonrise Towers.\nHalsin: Innocents go in, True Souls come out. Given that all of these True Souls are infected, it has to be the source of this magic.\nHalsin: If you want to find a cure, you must head there and discover how the tadpoles are being manipulated.\nPlayer: At least I know what to do now. Thank you.\nHalsin: Wait - I could help you find a cure... but I need to settle matters here first.\nHalsin: I've no right to ask more of you... but if you could help me, I'd be free to join your journey to Moonrise.\nHalsin: I cannot allow these butchers to threaten my grove. The natural order must be protected.\nPlayer: The other druids are dead, by my hand.\nHalsin: What...? How? Why?! Explain yourself at once!\nPlayer: They left me no choice. I had to defend myself.\nHalsin: Then... then it is as you say. They forgot their principles; you had no choice.

You have my sincere sympathies.\nPlayer: This magic you mentioned - it isn't normal for these parasites?\nPlayer: Then everything we did here was hopeless.\nHalsin: Patience. I can't just snap my fingers... but I know where the solution almost certainly lies.\nHalsin: I overheard that the cultists are sending all of their captives to Moonrise Towers.\nHalsin: Innocents go in, True Souls come out. Given that all of these True Souls are infected, it has to be the source of this magic.\nHalsin: If you want to find a cure, you must head there and discover how the tadpoles are being manipulated.\nPlayer: Altered parasites? A cure at Moonrise Towers, maybe? Sounds like guesswork at best.\nHalsin: I'm as certain as I can be. If you have a better alternative, I won't stop you.\nHalsin: I can't stop you, in fact.

First we obtained the crown; then we enslaved the brain. From there, it was but a small step to the most successful religious hoax ever perpetrated.\nPlayer: Ask the Emperor: Is he telling the truth?\nGROUP_Emperors: It seems so.\nPlayer: What was my role in this plan?\nLord Enver Gortash: In Bhaal's name, you set your bloody daggers to cause panic in the streets, killing in the Absolute's name.\nLord Enver Gortash: You would have carried out that part of the plan, had Orin not ruined your hard work.\nLord Enver Gortash: Next, the threat of the Absolute's monstrous armies formed by Myrkul's general, Ketheric Thorm.\nLord Enver Gortash: In such circumstances, people crave strong leaders. Leaders that bring law, order, and protection. Leaders like me, Bane's unyielding hand, author of justice.\nLord Enver Gortash: You are soon to witness the people of Baldur's Gate granting me complete power over them. All out of fear of the Absolute.\nLord Enver Gortash: Next, I - we - will declare curfew and begin infecting the masses. Our subjects will hear the voice of their Absolute god.\nLord Enver Gortash: The faithful will do anything in the name of their god.\nPlayer: Very clever.\nLord Enver Gortash: More importantly, just.\nLord Enver Gortash: Now come, be witness as I make history as the first Archduke of Baldur's Gate.\nPlayer: I have no interest in this sham of a ceremony.\nLord Enver Gortash: This is the first step towards our glory.

A true friend of nature - or perhaps a lunatic.\nHalsin: Either way, I owe thanks. I am the druid Halsin.\nPlayer: I spoke to Nettie - she said you could help me with the parasite in my head.\nHalsin: Parasite in your head...? You mean you have one of them?\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Halsin raises a hand to your head, magically connecting with you (no contact). He gives an alarmed look - he knows what’s inside you\nHalsin: Oak Father preserve you, child... You're infected, aren't you? The mind flayers' spawn.\nHalsin: But... something's different. You're aware of the monster inside you. You don't bow to the Absolute, like the True Souls do...\nHalsin: How is this possible...?\nPlayer: I don't know.\nHalsin: You weren't speaking lightly when you said you needed help. Let me tell you what I know.\nHalsin: I've been studying these parasites for a while now. Ever since I discovered these so-called True Souls are infected with them.\nHalsin: Someone is using very powerful magic to modify these tadpoles. They are using them to exert control over the infected.\nHalsin: I'm sorry to say, I can't undo that magic, which means I can't cure you. But that doesn't mean I can't help.\nHalsin: I didn't find what I came here for - a way to remove the tadpoles - but I found the next best thing. I found out where they come from.\nHalsin: That must be where these enchantments are placed on them, and it's where you'll find your cure.\nPlayer: So all of this was for nothing.\nHalsin: Patience. I can't just snap my fingers... but I know where the solution almost certainly lies.\nHalsin: I overheard that the cultists are sending all of their captives to Moonrise Towers.\nHalsin: Innocents go in, True Souls come out. Given that all of these True Souls are infected, it has to be the source of this magic.\nHalsin: If you want to find a cure, you must head there and discover how the tadpoles are being manipulated.\nPlayer: At least I know what to do now. Thank you.\nHalsin: Wait - I could help you find a cure... but I need to settle matters here first.\nHalsin: I've no right to ask more of you... but if you could help me, I'd be free to join your journey to Moonrise.\nHalsin: I cannot allow these butchers to threaten my grove. The natural order must be protected.\nPlayer: Kagha was swayed by Shadow Druids. She nearly sealed the grove.\nHalsin: Kagha... I should have suspected she'd take things too far. I'll deal with her when I can.\nHalsin: But there are other matters to attend to before that.\nHalsin: Chaos is welcome, in doses; it helps keep balance. But this is too much - this is unnatural.\nHalsin: Help me kill the leaders of this horde, save my grove. Then I will help you.\n\nHalsin: Three deaths could win us peace: the drow Minthara, the hobgoblin Dror Ragzlin, and that perversion of a priestess, Gut.\nHalsin: They are the ones holding these parasites together. Remove them and nature will cure itself.\nPlayer: You are aware you're asking me to kill a drow?\nHalsin: You drow relish turning on your own, if there's something to be gained. Don't pretend otherwise.\nPlayer: There's no pretence in not wanting to play the assassin. You're on your own.",

Where the Styx collects the blood of the fallen.\nMizora: Where your rightful mistress shoulders the burdens of perpetual war.\nMizora: Reach out. Have a taste.\nPlayer: Gorge on the River of Blood.

The molten seas and soil of Phlegethos. Stygia, the frozen ocean.\nMizora: Choose a Hell. Have your fill.\nPlayer: The barren wastes of Dis.\nNarrator: *Suffering. It rises from the foul ichor of the vast plains of Dis. The pain of the damned is your pleasure. Your soul cries for more, more, more.*\n\nThe player extends both arms out toward the flames, palms down. Their eyes close as they connect with Mizora's hellish offerings.\n\nShe watches as the pleasure rides out the sensations.\nMizora: To think how you've starved yourself up to this moment. To think how you chose the sweet over the bitter.\nMizora: One last choice, and starve no longer.\nMizora: Malbolge, the desolation. The forgotten ruins of Maladomini. Cania and its mountains of ice. Or Nessus, the seat of infernal power.\nPlayer: Cania, realm of glaciers.\nNarrator: *Ice. Its embrace is tighter than any you've known. It is cold, but you want colder. You want total zero.*\n\nThe player player rotates their palms upward, and look up, basking in the arcane sensory experience.\nInternalNodeContext: Cannot be aliased due to VFX coloration and narration, anims resued though.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: The player turns and faces Mizora.

You don't bow to the Absolute, like the True Souls do...\nHalsin: How is this possible...?\nPlayer: I don't know.\nHalsin: You weren't speaking lightly when you said you needed help. Let me tell you what I know.\nHalsin: I've been studying these parasites for a while now.

I found out where they come from.\nHalsin: That must be where these enchantments are placed on them, and it's where you'll find your cure.\nPlayer: How did you come to study mind flayer parasites?\nHalsin: A drow forced me to defend myself. Afterwards, I was able to study the parasite that slithered out of the corpse, see what drives these 'True Souls'.\nHalsin: I had no idea anyone beyond their ranks was infected. You have my sincere sympathies.\nPlayer: Sympathies won't help me to survive.\nHalsin: Patience. I can't just snap my fingers... but I know where the solution almost certainly lies.\nHalsin: I overheard that the cultists are sending all of their captives to Moonrise Towers.\nHalsin: Innocents go in, True Souls come out. Given that all of these True Souls are infected, it has to be the source of this magic.\nHalsin: If you want to find a cure, you must head there and discover how the tadpoles are being manipulated.\nPlayer: Altered parasites? A cure at Moonrise Towers, maybe? Sounds like guesswork at best.\nHalsin: I'm as certain as I can be. If you have a better alternative, I won't stop you.\nHalsin: I can't stop you, in fact. Which brings me to my next problem...\nHalsin: I've no right to ask more of you... but if you could help me, I'd be free to join your journey to Moonrise.\nHalsin: I cannot allow these butchers to threaten my grove. The natural order must be protected.\nPlayer: Kagha was swayed by Shadow Druids. She nearly sealed the grove.\nHalsin: Kagha... I should have suspected she'd take things too far. I'll deal with her when I can.\nHalsin: But there are other matters to attend to before that.\nHalsin: Chaos is welcome, in doses; it helps keep balance. But this is too much - this is unnatural.\nHalsin: Help me kill the leaders of this horde, save my grove. Then I will help you.\n\nHalsin: Three deaths could win us peace: the drow Minthara, the hobgoblin Dror Ragzlin, and that perversion of a priestess, Gut.\nHalsin: They are the ones holding these parasites together. Remove them and nature will cure itself.\nPlayer: You ask too much of me. I can't help you.",

The Absolute chose well when She chose you.\nNightwarden Minthara: I will gather a raiding party and move into position.\nNightwarden Minthara: You will open the gates from the inside when the time is right to strike.\nNightwarden Minthara: We will cleanse the place of infidels and burn it to the ground in the Absolute's name.\nNightwarden Minthara: And then we will be the first among Her favourites.\nNarrator: *The masterful painting she depicts of the massacre awakens you hungrily.*\nPlayer: I've done enough.

Her hands are in a prayer position and she's chanting softly as the moonlight dances around her. She exhales, then inhales and breaths in tendrils of shadow, absorbing them. She swallows, then begins hacking coughing. The moonlight dissipates. She quickly goes from seeming like a divine spirit to a normal young woman.\nIsobel: I didn't realise I had an audience.\nFist Marcus: Isobel. This is -\nIsobel: A Sharran.\nNarrator: *Isobel. The same name as Ketheric Thorm's daughter - the one whose sarcophagus you found empty in the family mausoleum.*\nPlayer: Push your Urges down.\nPlayer: Isobel - Isobel Thorm?\n: False\nIsobel: An unfortunate coincidence. I hope never to meet the wicked man who haemorrhaged shadows over this peaceful village. I've heard you might be the person to stop him.\nIsobel: A True Soul with a soul. Imagine.\nIsobel: But if you are who I think you are, I'd be a fool to reject your help. The True Soul with... well, a soul. Imagine.\nPlayer: You seem to have a lot to say about my allegiance. Can we focus on the task at hand?\nIsobel: I suppose that would be wise. We have a common enemy, after all: Ketheric Thorm.\nIsobel: You'll be needing the protection spell, I presume?\nIsobel: Oh - aren't you looking for a protection spell?\nPlayer: I need nothing from a Selûnite.\nIsobel: But any others who travel with you may not agree. Do it for them at least - you will need all the help you can get out there.\nPlayer: Try to understand what's happening.\nNarrator: *Is Lady Shar punishing you? Or perhaps testing you? Is it the tadpole, or a curse? You cannot say.*\nIsobel: Well! If the Moonmaiden didn't strike me dead for blessing you, she must rather approve of this little alliance.\nIsobel: This will block the lesser effects of the shadow curse, allowing you to traverse the darkness outside... should Shar's own protection falter, that is.\nIsobel: Curious. Surely the Nightsinger could have shielded all her followers, and made this place her domain long ago... yet she only acts now, and aids you alone. I wonder why.\nPlayer: I don't know what to make of it myself.\nIsobel: I suppose Shar is nothing if not mysterious.\nIsobel: I'll stop needling you, though. You have more important things to do, after all.\nPlayer: I've already been to Moonrise, but I have more work to do indeed.\nIsobel: I imagine so, if Jaheira hasn't gone tearing off into the night.\nPlayer: You're coming with me, cleric.",

Don't you dare consider it.\nPlayer: What are you going to do with it?\nHavkelaag: Study it, of course. The githyanki have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months.\nHavkelaag: You are no doubt aware that citizens of the Underdark are held in great suspicion by those who live above ground. Many believe us to be 'evil'.\nHavkelaag: The githyanki face similar prejudice, but I believe, if hatched in a less violent, more intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome its evil predispositions.\nHavkelaag: I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: What does this 'intellectually stimulating' upbringing look like?\nHavkelaag: In the literal sense, I will need to induce the egg to hatch via the application of certain currents to the creature inside.\nHavkelaag: Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach:\nHavkelaag: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue.\nHavkelaag: Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: This experiment is exactly the kind of evil you're trying to disprove.\nHavkelaag: The pursuit of knowledge is neither evil nor good.

Kagha - their new First Druid - won't even see me.\nZevlor: You, though... I know it's not your business, but she owes you for saving this place.\nZevlor: Perhaps you could persuade her. For more time to prepare, if nothing else.\nPlayer: I'm sorry. I've got my own problems.\nPlayer: Enough about the ritual. I have my own problems.",

We surrendered, but that wasn't enough for them.\nAlfira: They lined us up like dogs. Asharak was with the kids, telling them it was gonna be all right.\nAlfira: Maybe that's why they picked him. Told him to kneel...\nAlfira: They took his eyes first. Then his tongue.\nPlayer: How did you survive?\nAlfira: Rolan, of all people, saved us.\nAlfira: He said he stayed in the grove because of you, and I'm damn glad of it. Without him... well, none of us would be here.\nPlayer: You're lucky to be alive.\nAlfira: I don't feel lucky. I feel... I feel like I'm at the end of my rope.\nAlfira: How do you do it? How do you keep going?\nPlayer: 'When the night is dark, stars shine brightest.' So keep on shining. It's going to be all right.\nAlfira: 'Heart's Requiem', right? The hero survives a war and rebuilds her life - stronger than ever. A tale worth remembering - especially now.\nAlfira: You've done so much for us already, but I have to ask - the others might still be out there.\nAlfira: If they're not dead, they're in Moonrise. And gods have mercy on anyone in that hellspit.\nPlayer: I imagine the cultists are torturing them right now.",

She sought a githyanki egg.\nHavkelaag: Yes, dear Lady Esther. One of our most reliable contractors, though unfortunately this particular request was too much even for her.\nHavkelaag: I believe she quite lost her senses over the task. She came here insisting I purchase an owlbear egg from her, of all things.\nHavkelaag: I don't suppose you've stumbled across any githyanki eggs during your travels? The Society will compensate you for any we purchase, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nHavkelaag: Would you consider parting with it? The Society's coffers are deep enough to cover any expenses accrued in its retrieval, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: Chk. Don't you dare consider it.\nPlayer: What are you going to do with it?\nHavkelaag: Study it, of course. The githyanki have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months.\nHavkelaag: You are no doubt aware that citizens of the Underdark are held in great suspicion by those who live above ground. Many believe us to be 'evil'.\nHavkelaag: The githyanki face similar prejudice, but I believe, if hatched in a less violent, more intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome its evil predispositions.\nHavkelaag: I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: You assume my people are evil, yet your research is built on sheer superstition.\nHavkelaag: Enough of your kind have wreaked destruction on this plane for me to be confident in my assertion.\nHavkelaag: When I have a suitable sample for my study, I will, however, prove that the effects of their biological inclination are reversible.\nHavkelaag: Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach:\nHavkelaag: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue.\nHavkelaag: Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: You would teach the child virtue, but rear it without patience. Curious.\nHavkelaag: Tell me, then, philosopher - if patience delays the fostering of the other virtues, can it be rightly called virtuous?\nPlayer: Perhaps not. Patience is important, but cannot impede the other virtues.\nHavkelaag: Then we are in accord - the time for action is now.\nHavkelaag: My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: Sounds pointless. Public opinion will hardly be swayed by such a small experiment.\nHavkelaag: Not at first. But if the experiment proves successful, it must be repeated. Only then will we know if the findings are to be trusted.\nHavkelaag: Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg?

Unfortunately, it seems I've mislaid my purse.\nHavkelaag: I don't suppose you'd consider simply donating it to the Society instead?\nPlayer: Fine. Here you go.",

I'm Zevlor.\nZevlor: And if I'm not mistaken, you're the Blade of Frontiers.\nPlayer: What is this place?\nZevlor: A druids' grove, dedicated to the Oak Father, Silvanus.

The druids blame us 'outsiders' for drawing them here. Nobody's welcome anymore.\nZevlor: They've started a ritual to cut the grove off from the world outside.\nZevlor: We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: What brought you here?\nZevlor: We're refugees from Elturel - we took shelter here after gnolls attacked us on the road.\nZevlor: We were bound for Baldur's Gate, and it was too late to turn back.

Kagha - their new First Druid - won't even see me.\nZevlor: You, though... I know it's not your business, but she owes you for saving this place.\nZevlor: Perhaps you could persuade her. For more time to prepare, if nothing else.\nPlayer: I'm sorry. I've got my own problems.\nPlayer: Enough about the ritual. I have my own problems.",

Surely you see it?\nNightwarden Minthara: In killing Ketheric, we fractured the cult's leadership. When we break the other Chosen and claim their Netherstones, we can take control.\nPlayer: A bold gamble. How can you be sure it's possible?\nNightwarden Minthara: I would have thought this entire conspiracy of gods and monsters to be impossible if I had not seen it for myself.\nNightwarden Minthara: We may fail, but we must try.\nNightwarden Minthara: The power of the enslaved elder brain could reshape the world. We could reshape the world.\nPlayer: The future you propose is shaped by violence. I'd prefer to find another way.\nNightwarden Minthara: There is violence in your future regardless. With me, you can at least be sure the violence will lead to glory.\nNightwarden Minthara: You are not stupid. When we reach Baldur's Gate and face the other Chosen, you will see that my way is the right one.\nPlayer: Maybe I'll change your mind.\nNightwarden Minthara: The elder brain is the only thing that has ever managed to change my mind. You're welcome to try.\nNightwarden Minthara: We are bound, then, to travel together, even if we do not yet agree on our ultimate purpose.\nNightwarden Minthara: There is yet one thing about you that troubles me, though. Something I need you to explain.\nNightwarden Minthara: When we killed the tieflings, at the grove, I was not in control of my actions. You do not have that excuse. So I ask you - why? Why kill them?\nPlayer: To watch them suffer - I need no other reason than that.",

Give me one reason why I shouldn't have my creations kill you right now, thief.\nPlayer: Touch me, and I'll strike you down with all of nature's fang and fury. Go ahead - try me.\nPlayer: You're hiding from shadows - literally. Don't make threats you can't back up.\n: True\nBalthazar: ...Fine. I'll forgive your transgressions this time - there are much grander things at stake.\nNodeContext: A pause before 'fine' - weighing up the player's fate.\nBalthazar: The Nightsong is my finest creation - if I never exceed myself, I will still die happy. Not that I ever intend to do something as gauche as truly dying, of course.\nBalthazar: Now, given your prying nature, I have work for you, as a scout.\nBalthazar: The Nightsong lends the General his strength, his invulnerability. It must be recovered, before his enemies attempt to exploit it.\nPlayer: Sounds like you've good reason to be proud of the Nightsong - tell me more.\nBalthazar: And spoil the surprise? I think not. But let's just say that the Nightsong was a unique specimen even before I began my work...\nBalthazar: Words - even my words - are woefully insufficient. When you see for yourself, you will understand.\nPlayer: What do you need me to do?\nBalthazar: I do not need you, or your help. But you are here in spite of that, so I may as well make use of you.\nBalthazar: The relic is close, but the way is barred and Shar's dead are... uncooperative. Clear the path for me - by blade, cunning, or whatever it takes.\nBalthazar: I will remain here until you have succeeded, or fallen.\nShadowheart: I'd trust this gasbag about as far as I can throw him - which isn't far.

Pure love. Total power.\nNightwarden Minthara: Orin was by my side. She told me that god had chosen me to be a True Soul. Blessed and adored.\nNightwarden Minthara: Now I know that those memories are lies.\nNightwarden Minthara: There was no god. Orin held me down in a cocoon of flesh, while a mind flayer forced a parasite into my brain. And she laughed at my fear.\nNightwarden Minthara: I will find her, I will murder her. And I will smile.\nPlayer: Is vengeance the limit of your ambitions?\nNightwarden Minthara: There is no limit to my ambitions. I will enjoy killing Orin, but unlike her, I do not kill for pleasure alone. I kill to gain advantage.\nNightwarden Minthara: And we have the chance to seize the greatest advantage of all. Surely you see it?\nNightwarden Minthara: In killing Ketheric, we fractured the cult's leadership. When we break the other Chosen and claim their Netherstones, we can take control.\nPlayer: Stealing an entire cult is a new one, even for me.\nNightwarden Minthara: In the long history of these Realms, few people have attempted anything so bold.\nNightwarden Minthara: We may fail, but we must try.\nNightwarden Minthara: The power of the enslaved elder brain could reshape the world. We could reshape the world.\nPlayer: The future you propose is shaped by violence. I'd prefer to find another way.\nNightwarden Minthara: There is violence in your future regardless. With me, you can at least be sure the violence will lead to glory.\nNightwarden Minthara: You are not stupid. When we reach Baldur's Gate and face the other Chosen, you will see that my way is the right one.\nPlayer: If you go to Baldur's Gate, you're going alone.\nNightwarden Minthara: Without you - without the Prism - I cannot risk going to the city. The Absolute would take my mind again.\nPlayer: You can stay with me if you swear to follow my lead.\nNightwarden Minthara: Fine. All I ask of you is that you keep an open mind.\nNightwarden Minthara: We are bound, then, to travel together, even if we do not yet agree on our ultimate purpose.\nNightwarden Minthara: There is yet one thing about you that troubles me, though. Something I need you to explain.\nNightwarden Minthara: When we killed the tieflings, at the grove, I was not in control of my actions. You do not have that excuse. So I ask you - why? Why kill them?\nPlayer: To watch them suffer - I need no other reason than that.",

Pure murder. No excesses.

Return to visit him, and tell the blood-drenched tale of your victory.\nSarevok Anchev: Before you may return to our Father's fold, I must first ensure that you remain as pure and worthy of his blessing as you once were.\nSarevok Anchev: So I ask -  why have you brought no offering, child of Bhaal?

The Society will compensate you for any we purchase, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nHavkelaag: Would you consider parting with it? The Society's coffers are deep enough to cover any expenses accrued in its retrieval, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: Chk. Don't you dare consider it.\nPlayer: What are you going to do with it?\nHavkelaag: Study it, of course. Your kind have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months.\nHavkelaag: Most on this plane believe you to be innately cruel, violent beings. Evil, if you will.\nHavkelaag: As citizens of the Underdark, we face similar stigmas. Totally unfounded, of course - our natures are as unfixed as any who walk the surface.\nHavkelaag: I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: You assume my people are evil, yet your research is built on sheer superstition.\nHavkelaag: Enough of your kind have wreaked destruction on this plane for me to be confident in my assertion.\nHavkelaag: When I have a suitable sample for my study, I will, however, prove that the effects of their biological inclination are reversible.\nHavkelaag: Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach:\nHavkelaag: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue.\nHavkelaag: Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: This experiment is exactly the kind of evil you're trying to disprove.\nHavkelaag: The pursuit of knowledge is neither evil nor good. Only in the application of such knowledge should one take on any moral imperative.\nHavkelaag: My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: And what if your experiment fails?\nHavkelaag: If the child remains evil after the experiment is concluded, it will be destroyed. Such is the fate of all used specimens.\nHavkelaag: Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg? ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: A gith hatchling is not a lab rat! This shka'keth should be bled dry for the mere suggestion.\nPlayer: Sell the egg.\nHavkelaag: Ah. Unfortunately, it seems I've mislaid my purse.\nHavkelaag: I don't suppose you'd consider simply donating it to the Society instead?\nPlayer: Fine. Here you go.",

Not that I ever intend to do something as gauche as truly dying, of course.\nBalthazar: Now, given your prying nature, I have work for you, as a scout.\nBalthazar: The Nightsong lends the General his strength, his invulnerability.

([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nHavkelaag: Would you consider parting with it? The Society's coffers are deep enough to cover any expenses accrued in its retrieval, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: Chk. Don't you dare consider it.\nPlayer: What are you going to do with it?\nHavkelaag: Study it, of course. Your kind have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months.\nHavkelaag: Most on this plane believe you to be innately cruel, violent beings. Evil, if you will.\nHavkelaag: As citizens of the Underdark, we face similar stigmas. Totally unfounded, of course - our natures are as unfixed as any who walk the surface.\nHavkelaag: I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: You're letting your personal biases affect your method. Why assume they're evil?\nHavkelaag: I assume nothing. Innate githyanki cruelty is an established fact - no doubt you witnessed it yourself in the retrieval of the egg itself.\nHavkelaag: When I have a suitable sample for my study, I will, however, prove that the effects of their biological inclination are reversible.\nHavkelaag: Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach:\nHavkelaag: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue.\nHavkelaag: Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: Why follow the dogma of a draconic god?\nHavkelaag: In my years of study, they're the closest I've found to moral perfection. Only under such rigorous 'goodness' will the subject stand a chance of being cured.\nHavkelaag: My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: No benefit could justify you inflicting such cruelty.\nHavkelaag: Rigorous experimental methods demand we do not indulge our own emotional responses in the application of discomfort to our subjects.\nHavkelaag: Only by the full, uninhibited application of psionic stimuli will we have a true measure of whether the child's innate evil has been cured.\nHavkelaag: Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg? ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: A gith hatchling is not a lab rat! This shka'keth should be bled dry for the mere suggestion.\nPlayer: Sell the egg.",

Give me one reason why I shouldn't have my creations kill you right now, thief.\nPlayer: I had Z'rell's permission - that good enough for you?\nBalthazar: Z'rell exceeds her authority. But fine, I'll overlook your transgressions this time - there are much grander things at stake.\nBalthazar: The Nightsong is my finest creation - if I never exceed myself, I will still die happy. Not that I ever intend to do something as gauche as truly dying, of course.\nBalthazar: Now, given your prying nature, I have work for you, as a scout.\nBalthazar: The Nightsong lends the General his strength, his invulnerability. It must be recovered, before his enemies attempt to exploit it.\nPlayer: Sounds like you've good reason to be proud of the Nightsong - tell me more.\nBalthazar: And spoil the surprise? I think not.

When you see for yourself, you will understand.\nPlayer: What do you need me to do?\nBalthazar: I do not need you, or your help. But you are here in spite of that, so I may as well make use of you.\nBalthazar: The relic is close, but the way is barred and Shar's dead are... uncooperative. Clear the path for me - by blade, cunning, or whatever it takes.\nBalthazar: I will remain here until you have succeeded, or fallen.\nShadowheart: I'd trust this gasbag about as far as I can throw him - which isn't far. But perhaps better to play along, for now.\nPlayer: For jobs like this it's good form to provide your operatives some extra resources.\n: True\nBalthazar: Fine.

They all were. I tried to make them better, but they were not strong enough. They lacked resolve.\nPlayer: So you killed them?\nPtaris: It is not my fault they died. I was only upholding father's code. Even he was not strong enough to follow it.\nPtaris: He was not righteous. He was not innocent. His thoughts were impure.\nPtaris: Such evil can only be cured one way. With pain. With torment. And if that does not work - with death.\nPtaris: Tell me - are you a good person?\nPlayer: Depends on how you define 'good'.\nPtaris: There is only one way. The Ptarian code. Do you follow it?\nPtaris: The Ptarian Code must be obeyed. This is the only way to be sure. Do you follow it?\nPlayer: I live by my own code, though not the one you speak of.\nPtaris: Then your code is flawed. Your actions cannot be defended.\nPtaris: I know what you did to me. I see the memory of it, right there in your head.\nPtaris: You stole me from my people. Gave me to that woman. Unhatched, defenceless. You let me be brought here so father could hurt me.\nLae'zel: A githyanki raised in isolation. His blood boils like Vlaakith's, but he knows nothing of the Protocols.\nPtaris: You are bad.

You smart enough for lanceboard? It's my first time playing.\n: False\nNarrator: *The keen gleam in Mol's eyes reveals the lie. She knows the game well, and she wants to win.*\nGale: I see that glint in your eyes. You've a strategy in mind. The same one as me, I'd wager.\nPlayer: Gale's right. Put pressure on him. Attack the pieces in front of his Cyric.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Mol nods, moving her piece forward and snagging one of Raphael's pawns.\nRaphael: My, the Theskan Double Counter-Gambit. Vicious. Exactly what I would have done.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Mol and Raphael exchange pieces, ending the game when she knocks his king over.\nMol: How's that for Calimshan rules?\nRaphael: Brava! Lovely work. I see I was right to make you the offer I did.\nRaphael: You will consider it, won't you?\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Mol nods, then folds the pieces into the landboard to put them away, disappearing out of view. When Raphael is centered on screen again, he is standing and smiling at the player.\nRaphael: What a lovely specimen she is. A blushing apple, begging to be plucked.\nKarlach: Please let me smack this creep.\nRaphael: The Theskan move suggestion was inspired. I had no idea you played.\nPlayer: Beating devils brings out the best in me.\nRaphael: So it seems.\nRaphael: But don't you worry about Mol - it goes without saying she still has the unconditional freedom to choose the only option she has left.\nRaphael: Besides, I do enjoy being in this neighbourhood again. It has such a rich history of abject tragedy.\nRaphael: And tragedy, my friend, well there's my bread and bloody butter.\nPlayer: Just stay away from Mol, you hear?",

Give me one reason why I shouldn't have my creations kill you right now, thief.\nPlayer: Because I'll rip your tongue out, shove it down your throat, then stomp on your 'creations' until they are dirt beneath my feet.\nPlayer: You're hiding from shadows - literally. Don't make threats you can't back up.\n: True\nBalthazar: ...Fine. I'll forgive your transgressions this time - there are much grander things at stake.\nNodeContext: A pause before 'fine' - weighing up the player's fate.\nBalthazar: The Nightsong is my finest creation - if I never exceed myself, I will still die happy. Not that I ever intend to do something as gauche as truly dying, of course.\nBalthazar: Now, given your prying nature, I have work for you, as a scout.\nBalthazar: The Nightsong lends the General his strength, his invulnerability. It must be recovered, before his enemies attempt to exploit it.\nPlayer: Sounds like you've good reason to be proud of the Nightsong - tell me more.\nBalthazar: And spoil the surprise? I think not. But let's just say that the Nightsong was a unique specimen even before I began my work...\nBalthazar: Words - even my words - are woefully insufficient.

Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy.\nMalus Thorm: Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision.

We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace.\nMalus Thorm: Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver.\nMalus Thorm: Come. Step forward. You are no sister, but that matters none. Every student is welcome.\nPlayer: I don't wish to study, only to lift the curse on this land.\nMalus Thorm: A curse?

What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being?\nMalus Thorm: If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: But you: look how the succour of Shar eludes you. See how painfully present you remain...\nMalus Thorm: We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: The sisters aren't ready.

For are we not all in need of a cure?\nMalus Thorm: The scalpel does not discriminate. Let each and every one of you partake in its soothing journey.\nMalus Thorm: Absence, sisters. Acquaint yourselves.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) Screaming and slashing, the sisters brutally murder each other.\nMalus Thorm: It is a proud moment when one sees one's teachings so lovingly taken to heart.\nMalus Thorm: You are to be commended for their graduation - rewarded with the promised cure.\nMalus Thorm: Come, I will acquaint you with the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nPlayer: You do me an honour, but I am not worthy.

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon’s voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar.\nMalus Thorm: See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy.\nMalus Thorm: Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace.\nMalus Thorm: Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver.\nMalus Thorm: Come. Step forward. You are no sister, but that matters none. Every student is welcome.\nPlayer: In my experience, torture is usually more pain and less proselytising.\nMalus Thorm: Behold, sisters, the very face of ignorance - one who mistakes tenderness for torture.\nMalus Thorm: Go on. Acquaint the face of ignorance with the true object of our studies.\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly.\nMalus Thorm: It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nGale: Gods, what living nightmare is this?\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being?\nMalus Thorm: If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: But you: look how the succour of Shar eludes even you, one who walks faithfully in her shadow. See how painfully present you remain...\nMalus Thorm: We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: The goddess has greater plans for me than to submit to your scalpels.\n: True\nMalus Thorm: Another absence is your fate? But if you are not here to be cured, how will my sisters learn?\nMalus Thorm: Their incisions are, as yet, still streaked with imprecision - that much I must concede.\nMalus Thorm: How to steady their hands, I wonder.\nPlayer: Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\n: True\nMalus Thorm: Yes... For are we not all in need of a cure?\nMalus Thorm: The scalpel does not discriminate. Let each and every one of you partake in its soothing journey.\nMalus Thorm: Absence, sisters. Acquaint yourselves.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) Screaming and slashing, the sisters brutally murder each other.\nMalus Thorm: It is a proud moment when one sees one's teachings so lovingly taken to heart.\nMalus Thorm: You are to be commended for their graduation - rewarded with the promised cure.\nMalus Thorm: Come, I will acquaint you with the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nPlayer: I sought purpose in the natural world - I see now that Shar is the only path. Show me how - I beg of you.\nPlayer: I would rather acquaint myself - if you show me how.\n: True\nMalus Thorm: Your diligence is exemplary. Very well: your own scalpel you will be.",

You know what's at stake here, I take it?\nBalthazar: But you're here now, and I may be able to put those limbs to work. You know what's at stake here, I take it?\nPlayer: Nere mentioned that you were seeking access to the Temple. Looks like you found it.\nBalthazar: Perhaps you'd be more useful dead than alive if you don't even know what I'm seeking here.\nBalthazar: But you're here now, and I may be able to put those limbs to work. You know what's at stake here, I take it?\nPlayer: Z'rell said Ketheric wants you to find a relic. That's all I know.\nPlayer: As you mention serving Ketheric, he sent you to find a relic, no?\nBalthazar: General Thorm to you. But yes, recovering the relic is the crux of it. He commands, and I, his humble servant, fulfil that command.\nBalthazar: While you, an infinitely more humble servant, fulfil my command. I will put you to work - as a scout.\nNarrator: *This necromancer has Ketheric's trust. Helping him might just be the best way to gain access to Moonrise Towers.*\nNarrator: *This necromancer has Ketheric's trust. Helping him could be just what you need to gain access to the man himself.*\nPlayer: I'm not the type to make a deal without the details. What exactly am I looking for?\nPlayer: I need more to go on. Why is this relic so important? What does it do?\n: False\nBalthazar: Telling you will not make the task any less perilous. Just obey, and use your ignorance as a shield. You should be adept at that already.\nBalthazar: The Nightsong lends the General his strength, his invulnerability. It must be recovered, before his enemies attempt to exploit it.\nPlayer: You need my help?\nBalthazar: I do not need you, or your help. But you are here in spite of that, so I may as well make use of you.\nBalthazar: The relic is close, but the way is barred and Shar's dead are... uncooperative. Clear the path for me - by blade, cunning, or whatever it takes.\nBalthazar: I will remain here until you have succeeded, or fallen.\nShadowheart: I'd trust this gasbag about as far as I can throw him - which isn't far. But perhaps better to play along, for now.\nPlayer: For jobs like this it's good form to provide your operatives some extra resources.\n: True\nBalthazar: Fine. I will assign Flesh to aid you on your way. Ring this bell...\nBalthazar: ...Hmm. Misplaced, it seems. You will be capable enough without it.\nPlayer: This sounds like your problem, not mine.\nPlayer: Keep it - this is your problem, not mine.\nBalthazar: This is not a problem - it is an opportunity. And it is not a choice either - you will obey.\nPlayer: Attack.",

You are no sister, but that matters none. Every student is welcome.\nPlayer: I am a scholar, this is true - just not in the study of torture.\nMalus Thorm: Behold, sisters, the very face of ignorance - one who mistakes tenderness for torture.\nMalus Thorm: Go on.

What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being?\nMalus Thorm: If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: But you: look how the succour of Shar eludes you. See how painfully present you remain...\nMalus Thorm: We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: Their blades are uneven.

We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace.\nMalus Thorm: Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver.\nMalus Thorm: Come. Step forward. You are no sister, but that matters none. Every student is welcome.\nPlayer: I am no student, I seek knowledge of the curse. It is a blight on this land.\nMalus Thorm: A curse? Nay, a cure that leads to the very pinnacle of being:\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence.

Entertaining, if not efficient.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being?\nMalus Thorm: If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: But you: look how the succour of Shar eludes even you, one who walks faithfully in her shadow. See how painfully present you remain...\nMalus Thorm: We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: The goddess has greater plans for me than to submit to your scalpels.\n: True\nMalus Thorm: Another absence is your fate? But if you are not here to be cured, how will my sisters learn?\nMalus Thorm: Their incisions are, as yet, still streaked with imprecision - that much I must concede.\nMalus Thorm: How to steady their hands, I wonder.\nPlayer: Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\n: True\nMalus Thorm: Yes... For are we not all in need of a cure?\nMalus Thorm: The scalpel does not discriminate. Let each and every one of you partake in its soothing journey.\nMalus Thorm: Absence, sisters. Acquaint yourselves.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) Screaming and slashing, the sisters brutally murder each other.\nMalus Thorm: It is a proud moment when one sees one's teachings so lovingly taken to heart.\nMalus Thorm: You are to be commended for their graduation - rewarded with the promised cure.\nMalus Thorm: Come, I will acquaint you with the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nPlayer: I am but a fumbling squire before a master swordsman. Please, demonstrate so that I might learn.\nPlayer: I would rather acquaint myself - if you show me how.\n: True\nMalus Thorm: Your diligence is exemplary. Very well: your own scalpel you will be.",

A true friend of nature - or perhaps a lunatic.\nHalsin: Either way, I owe thanks. I am the druid Halsin.\nPlayer: Glad I could be of help.\nHalsin: I must admit, I didn't expect anyone would come to my aid. Who in their right mind would infiltrate a goblin infested temple. Unless...\nHalsin: ...Hrrm. That look in your eyes - I've seen it before. Are you feeling all right?\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Halsin raises a hand to your head, magically connecting with you (no contact). He gives an alarmed look - he knows what’s inside you\nHalsin: Oak Father preserve you, child... You're infected, aren't you? The mind flayers' spawn.\nHalsin: But... something's different. You're aware of the monster inside you. You don't bow to the Absolute, like the True Souls do...\nHalsin: How is this possible...?\nPlayer: I think this artefact has something to do with it.\nHalsin: Hmmm... that looks very alien. As alien as the mind flayers. They do not belong on this world.\nHalsin: You weren't speaking lightly when you said you needed help. Let me tell you what I know.\nHalsin: I've been studying these parasites for a while now. Ever since I discovered these so-called True Souls are infected with them.\nHalsin: Someone is using very powerful magic to modify these tadpoles. They are using them to exert control over the infected.\nHalsin: I'm sorry to say, I can't undo that magic, which means I can't cure you. But that doesn't mean I can't help.\nHalsin: I didn't find what I came here for - a way to remove the tadpoles - but I found the next best thing. I found out where they come from.\nHalsin: That must be where these enchantments are placed on them, and it's where you'll find your cure.\nPlayer: Tell me what you've learned about the tadpoles' origins.\nHalsin: I overheard that the cultists are sending all of their captives to Moonrise Towers.\nHalsin: Innocents go in, True Souls come out. Given that all of these True Souls are infected, it has to be the source of this magic.\nHalsin: If you want to find a cure, you must head there and discover how the tadpoles are being manipulated.\nPlayer: At least I know what to do now. Thank you.\nHalsin: Wait - I could help you find a cure... but I need to settle matters here first.\nHalsin: I've no right to ask more of you... but if you could help me, I'd be free to join your journey to Moonrise.\nHalsin: I cannot allow these butchers to threaten my grove. The natural order must be protected.\nPlayer: Kagha was swayed by Shadow Druids. She nearly sealed the grove.\nHalsin: Kagha... I should have suspected she'd take things too far. I'll deal with her when I can.\nHalsin: But there are other matters to attend to before that.\nHalsin: Chaos is welcome, in doses; it helps keep balance. But this is too much - this is unnatural.\nHalsin: Help me kill the leaders of this horde, save my grove. Then I will help you.\n\nHalsin: Three deaths could win us peace: the drow Minthara, the hobgoblin Dror Ragzlin, and that perversion of a priestess, Gut.\nHalsin: They are the ones holding these parasites together. Remove them and nature will cure itself.\nPlayer: I'll deal with this. You get to safety.\nHalsin: I told you, nowhere is safe. Not while this rot festers. Once it is cut out - once the grove is secure - then I shall leave.\nPlayer: Follow me, then. Your bear form may prove useful.\nHalsin: Be warned - my presence could make things more difficult... I can only restrain my bear form so much. I won't be able to help but attack goblins.\nHalsin: If I join you, we'll likely have to slaughter this entire place. You may want to use discretion when approaching the goblin leaders.\nPlayer: Stay here.",

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon’s voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar.\nMalus Thorm: See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy.\nMalus Thorm: Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace.\nMalus Thorm: Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver.\nMalus Thorm: Come. Step forward. You are no sister, but that matters none. Every student is welcome.\nPlayer: I am a scholar, this is true - just not in the study of torture.\nMalus Thorm: Behold, sisters, the very face of ignorance - one who mistakes tenderness for torture.\nMalus Thorm: Go on. Acquaint the face of ignorance with the true object of our studies.\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly.\nMalus Thorm: It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nLae'zel: Only a beast of a man toys with his victim. Entertaining, if not efficient.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being?\nMalus Thorm: If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: But you: look how the succour of Shar eludes even you, one who walks faithfully in her shadow. See how painfully present you remain...\nMalus Thorm: We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: The sisters aren't ready. They'll make me sick instead of curing me.\n: True\nMalus Thorm: Their incisions are, as yet, still streaked with imprecision - that much I must concede.\nMalus Thorm: How to steady their hands, I wonder.\nPlayer: Practice - that's how I got good with a blade. They should spar each other.\nPlayer: Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\n: True\nMalus Thorm: Yes... For are we not all in need of a cure?",

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon’s voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar.\nMalus Thorm: See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy.\nMalus Thorm: Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace.\nMalus Thorm: Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver.\nMalus Thorm: Come. Step forward. You are no sister, but that matters none. Every student is welcome.\nPlayer: Just kill them already - all this torture is pointless.\nMalus Thorm: Behold, sisters, the very face of ignorance - one who mistakes tenderness for torture.\nMalus Thorm: Go on. Acquaint the face of ignorance with the true object of our studies.\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly.\nMalus Thorm: It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nLae'zel: Only a beast of a man toys with his victim. Entertaining, if not efficient.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being?\nMalus Thorm: If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: But you: look how the succour of Shar eludes even you, one who walks faithfully in her shadow. See how painfully present you remain...\nMalus Thorm: We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: Your subject is tainted. Shar's succour must only be granted to the willing.\nMalus Thorm: Hmmm. 'Only the willing may know the Lady's embrace.' You know her teachings well.\nMalus Thorm: And yet, these sisters must exercise their gifts, for the art of absence lies in its execution.\nMalus Thorm: How to proceed, I wonder.\nPlayer: The sisters require a willing volunteer, a master of the art.\n: True\nMalus Thorm: I see now. By example I must edify and quell the light that blinds us.",

The answer is Mizora. It's always been Mizora.\nWyll: So you'd think. But the right answer is much simpler than that:\nWyll: Time.\nWyll: Time is so gods-damned greedy. It can never give, only take. My eternal soul is at its mercy.\nWyll: It builds mountains and deserts, only to tear them asunder. It fells armies, it conquers kings, queens - even gods.\nWyll: We blink, and we're gone.

The wyrm is fallen.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: A terrible fate for Ansur, my son. Yet my hopes for the city's future have never been higher.\nWyll: I don't understand.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: You and your allies slayed the undead terror that was once the great Ansur. You are stronger than even the great wyrm.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: You will be the one to part the storms and lead the people through. You, not Ansur, are the saviour we need.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: First, you will fell the Absolute. Then, we will rebuild Baldur's Gate, we will take back our city - together.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: I will name you Baldur's Gate's newest Grand Duke of the Council. You will be hailed Heart of the Gate.\nWyll: Grand Duke? I look the part of a fiend.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: I will tell the citizens and the patriars of your good works.

It never was.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: You turned your back on me, on your city, to chase the she-devil and her power. She stinks up this place even now.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: It is exactly what I think.\nPlayer: Wyll's devoted his life to protecting the Coast.

I did for you.\nPlayer: It's the truth, Ravengard. Wyll has always been a faithful defender of Baldur's Gate.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: My son, you sold your soul to save Baldur's Gate - and I cast you out for it.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: You gave yourself to the Hells' eternal fires so I might walk free.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: By the gods, can you ever forgive me?\nWyll: There's nothing to forgive. You wanted to protect the city. I only ever wanted the same.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: You are a better man than most, and a better son than I deserve. I'll yet make amends, but -\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: - my duty is first and foremost to the city and its people. There's something I must ask of you.\nPlayer: Go on.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Before I was captured, I was on a mission.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Returning from Elturel, I discovered the plans of the Absolutists. I immediately realised the city couldn't defend itself against such an army.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: I didn't despair because the city has a secret guardian, a wyrm that sleeps beneath. He can be called upon in times of great need.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: This is such a time. You've been trained in the ways of the great champions and proven to be one of them. The wyrm will answer your call. You must seek him out.\nPlayer: A wyrm? Are you saying there's a dragon living under the city?\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: A bronze dragon, yes. He sleeps beneath us even now, awaiting a hero to rouse him.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: The wyrm goes by many names. Ansur. The Waiting Storm. The Heart of the Gate.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: He promised Balduran he'd protect the city if ever its existence was threatened. But just the once.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Since then, the city has faced countless threats, but we always overcame. There was never a need to call on the wyrm - until now.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: The Absolute is the greatest threat Baldur's Gate ever faced. The wyrm must be awakened - and the task falls to you.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: There is a tome - 'The Legend of Ansur'. An ancient epic, ill-remembered, dismissed as a mere tale.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: I once held a copy, but it was stolen. Find it, let it set the path before you.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Let it set the path before you.\nPlayer: Wyll? What do you make of this?",

Aradin's a blowhard, but that's no cause for me to join him.\nZevlor: Thank you for your help out there. I'm Zevlor.\nZevlor: And if I'm not mistaken, you're the Blade of Frontiers.\nPlayer: What is this place?\nZevlor: A druids' grove, dedicated to the Oak Father, Silvanus. You'll find its keepers just as thorny, I fear.\nZevlor: Whatever your business, I'd see to it quickly - the druids are forcing everyone out.\nZevlor: This attack will only strengthen their resolve.\nPlayer: I have no quarrel with druids.\nZevlor: There have been several attacks by different monsters. The druids blame us 'outsiders' for drawing them here. Nobody's welcome anymore.\nZevlor: They've started a ritual to cut the grove off from the world outside.\nZevlor: We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: What brought you here?\nZevlor: We're refugees from Elturel - we took shelter here after gnolls attacked us on the road.\nZevlor: We were bound for Baldur's Gate, and it was too late to turn back. Elturel had no place for tieflings after the Descent.\nNarrator: *You remember it. Elturel and all its citizens were dragged into Avernus - then back out again.*\nPlayer: Found sanctuary here, did you?\nZevlor: So I hoped. But we've lost so many already - and more will die if we're forced out again.\nZevlor: We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: What brought you here?\nZevlor: We're refugees from Elturel - we took shelter here after gnolls attacked us on the road.\nZevlor: We were bound for Baldur's Gate, and it was too late to turn back. Elturel had no place for tieflings after the Descent.\nKarlach: Gods, these are those tiefs? Their whole city was dragged into Avernus for a while. Zariel was delighted. When they made it back out, I'd hoped they got their happy ending.\nNarrator: *'The Descent' - an infernal conspiracy that had seen the entire city of Elturel briefly dragged to the Hells.*\nPlayer: If your people survived that, they'll survive anything.\nZevlor: So I hoped. But we've lost so many already - and more will die if we're forced out again.\nZevlor: We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: This ritual - is there no way to convince the druids to stop it?\nZevlor: I've tried. Kagha - their new First Druid - won't even see me.\nZevlor: You, though... I know it's not your business, but she owes you for saving this place.\nZevlor: Perhaps you could persuade her. For more time to prepare, if nothing else.\nPlayer: I'll see what I can do.\nPlayer: I'll find her. And I'll speak to Kagha while I'm there.",

If the Moonmaiden didn't strike me dead for blessing you, she must rather approve of this little alliance.\nIsobel: This will block the lesser effects of the shadow curse, allowing you to traverse the darkness outside... should Shar's own protection falter, that is.\nIsobel: Curious. Surely the Nightsinger could have shielded all her followers, and made this place her domain long ago... yet she only acts now, and aids you alone.

But the right answer is much simpler than that:\nWyll: Time.\nWyll: Time is so gods-damned greedy. It can never give, only take. My eternal soul is at its mercy.\nWyll: It builds mountains and deserts, only to tear them asunder. It fells armies, it conquers kings, queens - even gods.\nWyll: We blink, and we're gone.

Will you be mine - today, and tomorrow, and reaching into eternity?\nPlayer: Yes, yes, yes!\nWyll: Gods. You've made me the happiest soul in all the Realms.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: The player takes the acorn from Wyll's hands.

I did for you.\nPlayer: It's time you two made up. We've got a city to save.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: All too right.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: My son, you sold your soul to save Baldur's Gate - and I cast you out for it.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: You gave yourself to the Hells' eternal fires so I might walk free.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: By the gods, can you ever forgive me?\nWyll: There's nothing to forgive. You wanted to protect the city. I only ever wanted the same.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: You are a better man than most, and a better son than I deserve. I'll yet make amends, but -\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: - my duty is first and foremost to the city and its people. There's something I must ask of you.\nPlayer: Go on.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Before I was captured, I was on a mission.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Returning from Elturel, I discovered the plans of the Absolutists. I immediately realised the city couldn't defend itself against such an army.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: I didn't despair because the city has a secret guardian, a wyrm that sleeps beneath. He can be called upon in times of great need.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: This is such a time. You've been trained in the ways of the great champions and proven to be one of them. The wyrm will answer your call. You must seek him out.\nPlayer: A wyrm? Are you saying there's a dragon living under the city?\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: A bronze dragon, yes. He sleeps beneath us even now, awaiting a hero to rouse him.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: The wyrm goes by many names. Ansur. The Waiting Storm. The Heart of the Gate.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: He promised Balduran he'd protect the city if ever its existence was threatened. But just the once.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Since then, the city has faced countless threats, but we always overcame. There was never a need to call on the wyrm - until now.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: The Absolute is the greatest threat Baldur's Gate ever faced. The wyrm must be awakened - and the task falls to you.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: There is a tome - 'The Legend of Ansur'. An ancient epic, ill-remembered, dismissed as a mere tale.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: I once held a copy, but it was stolen. Find it, let it set the path before you.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Let it set the path before you.\nPlayer: Wyll? What do you make of this?",

The druids blame us 'outsiders' for drawing them here.

Elturel had no place for tieflings after the Descent.\n: True\nPlayer: You made it back from Avernus. Surely you can survive anything?\nZevlor: So I hoped. But we've lost so many already - and more will die if we're forced out again.\nZevlor: We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: This ritual - is there no way to convince the druids to stop it?\nZevlor: I've tried. Kagha - their new First Druid - won't even see me.\nZevlor: You, though... I know it's not your business, but she owes you for saving this place.\nZevlor: Perhaps you could persuade her. For more time to prepare, if nothing else.\nPlayer: I have my own temporal concerns. I need a healer.\nPlayer: I'll find her. And I'll speak to Kagha while I'm there.",

I'm Zevlor.\nZevlor: And if I'm not mistaken, you're the Blade of Frontiers.\nPlayer: What is this place?\nZevlor: A druids' grove, dedicated to the Oak Father, Silvanus. You'll find its keepers just as thorny, I fear.\nZevlor: Whatever your business, I'd see to it quickly - the druids are forcing everyone out.\nZevlor: This attack will only strengthen their resolve.\nPlayer: Why are they forcing you out?\nZevlor: There have been several attacks by different monsters. The druids blame us 'outsiders' for drawing them here. Nobody's welcome anymore.\nZevlor: They've started a ritual to cut the grove off from the world outside.\nZevlor: We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: What brought you here?\nZevlor: We're refugees from Elturel - we took shelter here after gnolls attacked us on the road.\nZevlor: We were bound for Baldur's Gate, and it was too late to turn back. Elturel had no place for tieflings after the Descent.\nNarrator: *You remember it. Elturel and all its citizens were dragged into Avernus - then back out again.*\nPlayer: I was there, you know.

But we've lost so many already - and more will die if we're forced out again.\nZevlor: We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: This ritual - is there no way to convince the druids to stop it?\nZevlor: I've tried. Kagha - their new First Druid - won't even see me.\nZevlor: You, though... I know it's not your business, but she owes you for saving this place.\nZevlor: Perhaps you could persuade her. For more time to prepare, if nothing else.\nPlayer: I have my own temporal concerns. I need a healer.\nPlayer: I'll find her. And I'll speak to Kagha while I'm there.",

The moon elves first plucking the strings of the Weave.\nWyll: Standing here, I feel like I can see into forever.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: The camera moves from the two of you and outwards. A vista of stunning and quiet beauty.\nPlayer: I'm not sure I can see into forever. But it's still a nice view.\nWyll: My favourite in all of the Coast. All of Faerûn, even.

He takes an acorn and holds it in the palm of his hands, but keeps them close to his body.\nWyll: My mother always said the Wilden Oak's acorns held just a touch of wishing magic.\nWyll: If that be so, then may my greatest wish come true tonight:\nWyll: I love you. Will you be mine - today, and tomorrow, and reaching into eternity?\nPlayer: I can't give you forever, Wyll. But I can give you tonight.\n: True\nWyll: But - I can't resist you.

Wyll has always been a faithful defender of Baldur's Gate.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: My son, you sold your soul to save Baldur's Gate - and I cast you out for it.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: You gave yourself to the Hells' eternal fires so I might walk free.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: By the gods, can you ever forgive me?\nWyll: There's nothing to forgive. You wanted to protect the city. I only ever wanted the same.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: You are a better man than most, and a better son than I deserve. I'll yet make amends, but -\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: - my duty is first and foremost to the city and its people. There's something I must ask of you.\nPlayer: Go on.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Before I was captured, I was on a mission.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Returning from Elturel, I discovered the plans of the Absolutists. I immediately realised the city couldn't defend itself against such an army.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: I didn't despair because the city has a secret guardian, a wyrm that sleeps beneath. He can be called upon in times of great need.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: This is such a time. You've been trained in the ways of the great champions and proven to be one of them. The wyrm will answer your call. You must seek him out.\nPlayer: Waking a dragon doesn't sound like a good idea.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: This is no ordinary dragon.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: The wyrm goes by many names. Ansur.

The exhausted Grand Duke is a flurry of emotion - gratitude and relief, anger and deep pain.*\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: My own son, still the she-devil's toy. Is this my fate - to rise from death into a hell of my own boy's making?\nWyll: It isn't what you think. It never was.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: You turned your back on me, on your city, to chase the she-devil and her power. She stinks up this place even now.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: It is exactly what I think.\nPlayer: Wyll pulled you from death's grip, and this is how you thank him?\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: You want my gratitude? Fine - take your fill.

He sees the agony in Wyll's face as an impossible choice is set before him.*\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: No. My son -\nNarrator: *The past becomes present, and Wyll's thoughts are laid bare. Ravengard sees Wyll partnering with Mizora to defeat Tiamat's cultists before they could lay siege to Baldur's Gate.*\nNarrator: *And he sees everything beyond. The nautiloid journey, the perilous path to Moonrise, the Astral Prism, and the Emperor within.*\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Wyll.\nWyll: Everything I did, I did for Baldur's Gate. I did for you.\nPlayer: Heh. I bet you feel like a real bastard right about now.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: I do. And I should.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: My son, you sold your soul to save Baldur's Gate - and I cast you out for it.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: You gave yourself to the Hells' eternal fires so I might walk free.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: By the gods, can you ever forgive me?\nWyll: There's nothing to forgive. You wanted to protect the city. I only ever wanted the same.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: You are a better man than most, and a better son than I deserve. I'll yet make amends, but -\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: - my duty is first and foremost to the city and its people. There's something I must ask of you.\nPlayer: Go on.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Before I was captured, I was on a mission.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Returning from Elturel, I discovered the plans of the Absolutists. I immediately realised the city couldn't defend itself against such an army.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: I didn't despair because the city has a secret guardian, a wyrm that sleeps beneath. He can be called upon in times of great need.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: This is such a time. You've been trained in the ways of the great champions and proven to be one of them. The wyrm will answer your call. You must seek him out.\nPlayer: What lessons do you mean?\nWyll: Courage. Insight. Strategy. Justice. I remember them well. You made me recite them every morning.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: So you do. And I thought you'd abandoned them, more fool me.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: The wyrm goes by many names. Ansur. The Waiting Storm. The Heart of the Gate.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: He promised Balduran he'd protect the city if ever its existence was threatened. But just the once.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Since then, the city has faced countless threats, but we always overcame. There was never a need to call on the wyrm - until now.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: The Absolute is the greatest threat Baldur's Gate ever faced. The wyrm must be awakened - and the task falls to you.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: There is a tome - 'The Legend of Ansur'. An ancient epic, ill-remembered, dismissed as a mere tale.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: I once held a copy, but it was stolen. Find it, let it set the path before you.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Let it set the path before you.\nPlayer: Wyll? What do you make of this?",

Kagha - their new First Druid - won't even see me.\nZevlor: You, though... I know it's not your business, but she owes you for saving this place.\nZevlor: Perhaps you could persuade her. For more time to prepare, if nothing else.\nPlayer: I'll see what I can do.\nPlayer: I'll find her. And I'll speak to Kagha while I'm there.",
