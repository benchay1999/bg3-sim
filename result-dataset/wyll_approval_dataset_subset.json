Aggressive action will not be tolerated in the presence of the patriars of this proud city.\nPlayer: Point taken. I'll keep things peaceful.\nGROUP_SteelWatchers: The Steel Watch appreciate your cooperation, citizen.\nNodeContext: Gets new command after starting to engage. Gortash sends a remote command to let the player through.\nLord Enver Gortash: Dearest patriars, but a moment. I must greet a most honoured guest.\nNodeContext: Magninamously and a bir formal, but still in the style of a politician where you can't tell if he's being sarcastic\nLord Enver Gortash: Crawling back from their bloody disgrace - it's my favourite assassin! Gods, you're a sight for sore eyes. Orin told me she made a fool of you, but I should've known you wouldn't go down that easy.\nPlayer: You know me?\nLord Enver Gortash: Then she didn't lie - the past is lost to you. Let me clear up some mysteries, then. We share so much history. You and I initiated this plot. We discussed in depth the failures of our predecessors and how to avoid them. We understood that if we were to unite, no one could stand in the way of the Dead Three. So unite we did. First we obtained the crown; then we enslaved the brain. From there, it was but a small step to the most successful religious hoax ever perpetrated.\nPlayer: What was my role in this plan?\nLord Enver Gortash: In Bhaal's name, you set your bloody daggers to cause panic in the streets, killing in the Absolute's name. You would have carried out that part of the plan, had Orin not ruined your hard work. Next, the threat of the Absolute's monstrous armies formed by Myrkul's general, Ketheric Thorm. In such circumstances, people crave strong leaders. Leaders that bring law, order, and protection. Leaders like me, Bane's unyielding hand, author of justice. You are soon to witness the people of Baldur's Gate granting me complete power over them. All out of fear of the Absolute. Next, I - we - will declare curfew and begin infecting the masses. Our subjects will hear the voice of their Absolute god. The faithful will do anything in the name of their god.\nPlayer: I've heard enough. Am I free to go?\nLord Enver Gortash: Soon. First, come and be witness as I make history as the first Archduke of Baldur's Gate. Now come, be witness as I make history as the first Archduke of Baldur's Gate.\nPlayer: All right.\nLord Enver Gortash: Then we proceed. The patriars await. Distinguished dukes, patriars. Dearest Ravengard - I will heed your call. A new chapter begins.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Gortash approaches Ravengard. Ravengard nods and steps forward. He holds a sword aloft - the sword of Balduran, perhaps. Gortash kneels, back to player. Everyone takes position for the Archduke ceremony.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Enver Gortash. Swearest thou, by Balduran's blade, to defend the citizens of Baldur's Gate from enemies within and without?\nLord Enver Gortash: I swear.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Swearest thou true faith and fealty to the same, by word, deed, and decree, so that none may suffer?\nLord Enver Gortash: I swear.\nNodeContext: Gortadsh is still kneeling looking down.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Gathered guests, grant ye consent?\nPlayer: Prepare to object.\nGale: Let's take a breath - the odds are stacked against us if we try to pick a fight now.\nPlayer: Stop this. Gortash and Ravengard are with the Absolute!\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: A traitor's words - they mean to fracture this Council!\nLord Enver Gortash: Patriars - let it be known. The War of the Absolute has begun.",

But I've only now come to see who my true enemy's been.\nPlayer: The poignant tedium of your story?\nWyll: I'd like to think not. The answer is much simpler than that: Time. Time is so gods-damned greedy. It can never give, only take. My eternal soul is at its mercy. It builds mountains and deserts, only to tear them asunder. It fells armies, it conquers kings, queens - even gods. We blink, and we're gone. And our hopes, our memories, our heart-bonds are gone with us. Lucky for us, I've found a way to stop time - If just for a moment. Come, let me show you.\nPlayer: All right. But this better be worth it.\nWyll: It is. I promise.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: The player takes Wyll's right hand with their left. Wyll smiles and the scene fades out.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: The scene fades back in. Wyll and the player are near the Chionthar, and walk towards a towering and impressive tree. Acorns are scattered underneath it. It is a beautiful night; the moon and stars shine bright.\nWyll: The Wilden Oak. Legend has it it's stood since the Age of Dawn. I used to come here and climb it when father's eye was turned elsewhere - daydream of the stories it might tell, if I listened close enough. The dragon lords sparking the skies above it. The moon elves first plucking the strings of the Weave. Standing here, I feel like I can see into forever.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: The camera moves from the two of you and outwards. A vista of stunning and quiet beauty.\nPlayer: A beautiful story. I'm glad you told it to me.\nWyll: I was hoping you'd think so. I've been thinking a lot about forever. Moreso, I've been thinking everything that comes before - And who I want at my side as it passes.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Wyll kneels to the ground. He takes an acorn and holds it in the palm of his hands, but keeps them close to his body.\nWyll: My mother always said the Wilden Oak's acorns held just a touch of wishing magic. If that be so, then may my greatest wish come true tonight: I love you. Will you be mine - today, and tomorrow, and reaching into eternity?\nPlayer: Gods, no. Have you looked at yourself? You're hideous.",

I must greet a most honoured guest.\nNodeContext: Magninamously and a bir formal, but still in the style of a politician where you can't tell if he's being sarcastic\nLord Enver Gortash: Crawling back from their bloody disgrace - it's my favourite assassin! Gods, you're a sight for sore eyes. Orin told me she made a fool of you, but I should've known you wouldn't go down that easy.\nPlayer: I have no clue what you're talking about - my memories are blighted.\nLord Enver Gortash: Then she didn't lie - the past is lost to you. Let me clear up some mysteries, then. We share so much history. You and I initiated this plot. We discussed in depth the failures of our predecessors and how to avoid them. We understood that if we were to unite, no one could stand in the way of the Dead Three. So unite we did. First we obtained the crown; then we enslaved the brain. From there, it was but a small step to the most successful religious hoax ever perpetrated.\nPlayer: What was my role in this plan?\nLord Enver Gortash: In Bhaal's name, you set your bloody daggers to cause panic in the streets, killing in the Absolute's name. You would have carried out that part of the plan, had Orin not ruined your hard work. Next, the threat of the Absolute's monstrous armies formed by Myrkul's general, Ketheric Thorm. In such circumstances, people crave strong leaders. Leaders that bring law, order, and protection. Leaders like me, Bane's unyielding hand, author of justice. You are soon to witness the people of Baldur's Gate granting me complete power over them. All out of fear of the Absolute. Next, I - we - will declare curfew and begin infecting the masses. Our subjects will hear the voice of their Absolute god. The faithful will do anything in the name of their god.\nPlayer: You make me sick.\nLord Enver Gortash: Yes, yes, I'm sure I do. Now come, be witness as I make history as the first Archduke of Baldur's Gate.\nPlayer: Fine. Let's get it over with.\nLord Enver Gortash: You will follow me. And you will show due respect. Distinguished dukes, patriars. Dearest Ravengard - I will heed your call. A new chapter begins.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Gortash approaches Ravengard. Ravengard nods and steps forward. He holds a sword aloft - the sword of Balduran, perhaps. Gortash kneels, back to player. Everyone takes position for the Archduke ceremony.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Enver Gortash. Swearest thou, by Balduran's blade, to defend the citizens of Baldur's Gate from enemies within and without?\nLord Enver Gortash: I swear.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Swearest thou true faith and fealty to the same, by word, deed, and decree, so that none may suffer?\nLord Enver Gortash: I swear.\nNodeContext: Gortadsh is still kneeling looking down.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Gathered guests, grant ye consent?\nPlayer: There is no more evil bastard in all of Baldur's Gate than this prick! Do not swear him in as your ruler.\nLord Enver Gortash: Pay no mind to this madwoman. She's a jealous old hanger-on who'd ruin me for the crime of my success in protecting our fair city.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: A traitor's words - they mean to fracture this Council!\nLord Enver Gortash: Watchers - to arms.

Her hands are in a prayer position and she's chanting softly as the moonlight dances around her. She exhales, then inhales and breaths in tendrils of shadow, absorbing them. She swallows, then begins hacking coughing. The moonlight dissipates. She quickly goes from seeming like a divine spirit to a normal young woman.\nIsobel: I didn't realise I had an audience.\nFist Marcus: Isobel. This is -\nIsobel: A Sharran.\nNarrator: *Isobel. The same name as Ketheric Thorm's daughter - the one whose sarcophagus you found empty in the family mausoleum.*\nPlayer: Push your Urges down. I thought I smelled a Selûnite.\nIsobel: At your service. Frankly, I'm surprised you're willing to help us. Your kind aren't known for their decency - particularly when a Sharran curse is our greatest obstacle. But if you are who I think you are, I'd be a fool to reject your help. The True Soul with... well, a soul. Imagine.\nPlayer: I may have the parasite of a True Soul, but not the mind of one.\nIsobel: And that's what makes you essential. You'll be needing the protection spell, I presume? Oh - aren't you looking for a protection spell?\nPlayer: Nod. Better to humour her than make an enemy of all in this place. Lady Shar will understand.\nIsobel: Refreshingly pragmatic of you. I sense Shar has offered some amount of protection to you already, but... well, no harm in extra precaution - even from a Selûnite.\nPlayer: Ngh... it hurts...\nIsobel: Well! If the Moonmaiden didn't strike me dead for blessing you, she must rather approve of this little alliance. This will block the lesser effects of the shadow curse, allowing you to traverse the darkness outside... should Shar's own protection falter, that is. Curious. Surely the Nightsinger could have shielded all her followers, and made this place her domain long ago... yet she only acts now, and aids you alone. I wonder why.\nPlayer: That's none of your concern.\nIsobel: I suppose you're right. I'll stop needling you, though. You have more important things to do, after all.\nPlayer: You're coming with me, cleric.",

    "conversation": "Halsin: Pardon the viscera. One should cherish all of nature's bounty... but goblin guts are quite far down the list.\nNodeContext: Hint of wry humour, Introducing himself after transforming from an owlbear and killing several goblins.\nHalsin: Not only do you speak with a bear, but you free it, too? A true friend of nature - or perhaps a lunatic. Either way, I owe thanks. I am the druid Halsin.\nPlayer: I spoke to Nettie - she said you could help me with the parasite in my head.\nHalsin: Parasite in your head...? You mean you have one of them?\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Halsin raises a hand to your head, magically connecting with you (no contact). He gives an alarmed look - he knows what’s inside you\nHalsin: Oak Father preserve you, child... You're infected, aren't you? The mind flayers' spawn. But... something's different. You're aware of the monster inside you. You don't bow to the Absolute, like the True Souls do... How is this possible...?\nPlayer: I think this artefact has something to do with it.\nHalsin: Hmmm... that looks very alien. As alien as the mind flayers. They do not belong on this world. You weren't speaking lightly when you said you needed help. Let me tell you what I know. I've been studying these parasites for a while now. Ever since I discovered these so-called True Souls are infected with them. Someone is using very powerful magic to modify these tadpoles. They are using them to exert control over the infected. I'm sorry to say, I can't undo that magic, which means I can't cure you. But that doesn't mean I can't help. I didn't find what I came here for - a way to remove the tadpoles - but I found the next best thing. I found out where they come from. That must be where these enchantments are placed on them, and it's where you'll find your cure.\nPlayer: Tell me what you've learned about the tadpoles' origins.\nHalsin: I overheard that the cultists are sending all of their captives to Moonrise Towers. Innocents go in, True Souls come out. Given that all of these True Souls are infected, it has to be the source of this magic. If you want to find a cure, you must head there and discover how the tadpoles are being manipulated.\nPlayer: Altered parasites? A cure at Moonrise Towers, maybe? Sounds like guesswork at best.\nHalsin: I'm as certain as I can be. If you have a better alternative, I won't stop you. I can't stop you, in fact. Which brings me to my next problem... I've no right to ask more of you... but if you could help me, I'd be free to join your journey to Moonrise. I cannot allow these butchers to threaten my grove. The natural order must be protected.\nPlayer: All right. How do I help?\nHalsin: My thanks. If you prevail, I'll owe you the debt of a lifetime. Rare is the beast that survives decapitation. Help me eliminate the drow Minthara, the hobgoblin Dror Ragzlin, and that perversion of a priestess, Gut. They are the ones holding these parasites together. Remove them and nature will cure itself.\nPlayer: You are aware you're asking me to kill a drow?\nHalsin: You drow relish turning on your own, if there's something to be gained. Don't pretend otherwise.\nPlayer: Not all drow are as you say.\nHalsin: Unfair of me, perhaps, but I've had few encounters with drow to make me think otherwise. Perhaps you can enlighten me.\nPlayer: The grove isn't my problem. I have to concentrate on saving myself.",

One should cherish all of nature's bounty... but goblin guts are quite far down the list.\nNodeContext: Hint of wry humour, Introducing himself after transforming from an owlbear and killing several goblins.\nHalsin: Not only do you speak with a bear, but you free it, too? A true friend of nature - or perhaps a lunatic. Either way, I owe thanks. I am the druid Halsin.\nPlayer: I spoke to Nettie - she said you could help me with the parasite in my head.\nHalsin: Parasite in your head...? You mean you have one of them?\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Halsin raises a hand to your head, magically connecting with you (no contact). He gives an alarmed look - he knows what’s inside you\nHalsin: Oak Father preserve you, child... You're infected, aren't you? The mind flayers' spawn. But... something's different. You're aware of the monster inside you. You don't bow to the Absolute, like the True Souls do... How is this possible...?\nPlayer: I escaped from an illithid ship after being infected. Maybe the process was interrupted.\nHalsin: Perhaps... but I wouldn't want to place all my faith in blind luck. You weren't speaking lightly when you said you needed help. Let me tell you what I know. I've been studying these parasites for a while now. Ever since I discovered these so-called True Souls are infected with them. Someone is using very powerful magic to modify these tadpoles. They are using them to exert control over the infected. I'm sorry to say, I can't undo that magic, which means I can't cure you. But that doesn't mean I can't help. I didn't find what I came here for - a way to remove the tadpoles - but I found the next best thing. I found out where they come from. That must be where these enchantments are placed on them, and it's where you'll find your cure.\nPlayer: How did you come to study mind flayer parasites?\nHalsin: A drow forced me to defend myself. Afterwards, I was able to study the parasite that slithered out of the corpse, see what drives these 'True Souls'. I had no idea anyone beyond their ranks was infected. You have my sincere sympathies.\nPlayer: Sympathies won't help me to survive.\nHalsin: Patience. I can't just snap my fingers... but I know where the solution almost certainly lies. I overheard that the cultists are sending all of their captives to Moonrise Towers. Innocents go in, True Souls come out. Given that all of these True Souls are infected, it has to be the source of this magic. If you want to find a cure, you must head there and discover how the tadpoles are being manipulated.\nPlayer: Altered parasites? A cure at Moonrise Towers, maybe? Sounds like guesswork at best.\nHalsin: I'm as certain as I can be. If you have a better alternative, I won't stop you. I can't stop you, in fact. Which brings me to my next problem... I've no right to ask more of you... but if you could help me, I'd be free to join your journey to Moonrise. I cannot allow these butchers to threaten my grove. The natural order must be protected.\nPlayer: Look around you - there's no order anymore. Only chaos.\nHalsin: Chaos is welcome, in doses; it helps keep balance. But this is too much - this is unnatural. Help me kill the leaders of this horde, save my grove. Then I will help you.\n Three deaths could win us peace: the drow Minthara, the hobgoblin Dror Ragzlin, and that perversion of a priestess, Gut. They are the ones holding these parasites together. Remove them and nature will cure itself.\nPlayer: You are aware you're asking me to kill a drow?\nHalsin: You drow relish turning on your own, if there's something to be gained. Don't pretend otherwise.\nPlayer: Not all drow are as you say.\nHalsin: Unfair of me, perhaps, but I've had few encounters with drow to make me think otherwise. Perhaps you can enlighten me.\nPlayer: You ask too much of me. I can't help you.",

We blink, and we're gone. And our hopes, our memories, our heart-bonds are gone with us. It even comes for your people in the astral sea. Time may hunt slowly - but it still hunts.

Gortash sends a remote command to let the player through.\nLord Enver Gortash: Dearest patriars, but a moment. I must greet a most honoured guest.\nNodeContext: Magninamously and a bir formal, but still in the style of a politician where you can't tell if he's being sarcastic\nLord Enver Gortash: Crawling back from their bloody disgrace - it's my favourite assassin! Gods, you're a sight for sore eyes. Orin told me she made a fool of you, but I should've known you wouldn't go down that easy.\nPlayer: You know me?\nLord Enver Gortash: Then she didn't lie - the past is lost to you. Let me clear up some mysteries, then. We share so much history. You and I initiated this plot. We discussed in depth the failures of our predecessors and how to avoid them. We understood that if we were to unite, no one could stand in the way of the Dead Three. So unite we did. First we obtained the crown; then we enslaved the brain. From there, it was but a small step to the most successful religious hoax ever perpetrated.\nPlayer: What does the cult of the Absolute have to do with this?\nLord Enver Gortash: It was all going so well - until you vanished. Orin informed us that henceforth she would speak for the temple of Bhaal, and act on their behalf. But she made a mess of things. Unlike you, she cannot control herself.\nKarlach: Hang on. What the fuck is going on here?\nPlayer: I don't remember a thing, but the plan sounds brilliant!\nLord Enver Gortash: We are brilliant. When Ketheric fell, I feared the worst. That our plans would fail like so many before. Because of discord among ourselves. Now you've returned, we can achieve all of our dreams still. You brought Thorm's Netherstone. You know, it takes all three to control the brain. Without Thorm's, it's become vexingly wilful. The quakes are a clear warning. If nobody steps in soon, it'll free itself from the authority of the crown. I expect it'll start with turning the Sword Coast's infected - you among them. That Prism of yours won't last indefinitely. Next, the Grand Design. The mind flayer empire reborn. If we're lucky, we'll become slaves. If we're unlucky, well - Not the most thrilling of prospects. But it's a fate that can be avoided if you and I come to an understanding. You may have brought my Steel Watch to its knees - but that's how I know you'd make a most formidable ally. Together we can still restore authority over the brain.\nGROUP_Emperors: Of course. Gortash always did have an eye for opportunity...\nReflecting on the fact that Gortash is now proposing an alliance with the player. Hates Gortash though, so this is with an edge of resentment.\nPlayer: I am ending this here, consequences be damned.\nLord Enver Gortash: Tut. So much potential, gone to waste. Patriars - let it be known. The Absolute's assassins walk among us!\nNodeContext: \"Tut\" read aloud like a word (as opposed to a dental click).",

I can't just snap my fingers... but I know where the solution almost certainly lies. I overheard that the cultists are sending all of their captives to Moonrise Towers.

The natural order must be protected.\nPlayer: All right. How do I help?\nHalsin: My thanks. If you prevail, I'll owe you the debt of a lifetime. Rare is the beast that survives decapitation. Help me eliminate the drow Minthara, the hobgoblin Dror Ragzlin, and that perversion of a priestess, Gut. They are the ones holding these parasites together. Remove them and nature will cure itself.\nPlayer: You are aware you're asking me to kill a drow?\nHalsin: You drow relish turning on your own, if there's something to be gained. Don't pretend otherwise.\nPlayer: Not all drow are as you say.\nHalsin: Unfair of me, perhaps, but I've had few encounters with drow to make me think otherwise.

Sounds like guesswork at best.\nHalsin: I'm as certain as I can be. If you have a better alternative, I won't stop you. I can't stop you, in fact. Which brings me to my next problem... I've no right to ask more of you... but if you could help me, I'd be free to join your journey to Moonrise. I cannot allow these butchers to threaten my grove. The natural order must be protected.\nPlayer: Look around you - there's no order anymore. Only chaos.\nHalsin: Chaos is welcome, in doses; it helps keep balance. But this is too much - this is unnatural. Help me kill the leaders of this horde, save my grove. Then I will help you.\n Three deaths could win us peace: the drow Minthara, the hobgoblin Dror Ragzlin, and that perversion of a priestess, Gut. They are the ones holding these parasites together. Remove them and nature will cure itself.\nPlayer: You are aware you're asking me to kill a drow?\nHalsin: You drow relish turning on your own, if there's something to be gained. Don't pretend otherwise.\nPlayer: There's no pretence in not wanting to play the assassin. You're on your own.",

Perfect. If the inhabitants do not realise you are the knife at their throats, we can use that against them. Go to their refuge and make your way inside. As a friend.\nPlayer: I don't have the most trustworthy face.\nNightwarden Minthara: They're half-devil refugees... Nobody wants them. A drowning creature will cling to a blade if nothing else is offered. Be that blade. I will gather a raiding party and move into position. You will open the gates from the inside when the time is right to strike. We will cleanse the place of infidels and burn it to the ground in the Absolute's name.

How is this possible...?\nPlayer: I think this artefact has something to do with it.\nHalsin: Hmmm... that looks very alien. As alien as the mind flayers. They do not belong on this world. You weren't speaking lightly when you said you needed help. Let me tell you what I know. I've been studying these parasites for a while now. Ever since I discovered these so-called True Souls are infected with them. Someone is using very powerful magic to modify these tadpoles. They are using them to exert control over the infected. I'm sorry to say, I can't undo that magic, which means I can't cure you. But that doesn't mean I can't help. I didn't find what I came here for - a way to remove the tadpoles - but I found the next best thing. I found out where they come from. That must be where these enchantments are placed on them, and it's where you'll find your cure.\nPlayer: You learned all this from your studies?\nHalsin: Indeed. After we dealt with the drow that ambushed us, Nettie and I were able to inspect the corpse - and the creature that slithered out of it. I had no idea anyone beyond their ranks was infected. You have my sincere sympathies.\nPlayer: What should I do?\nHalsin: I overheard that the cultists are sending all of their captives to Moonrise Towers. Innocents go in, True Souls come out. Given that all of these True Souls are infected, it has to be the source of this magic. If you want to find a cure, you must head there and discover how the tadpoles are being manipulated.\nPlayer: Altered parasites? A cure at Moonrise Towers, maybe?

I had to defend myself.\nHalsin: Then... then it is as you say. They forgot their principles; you had no choice. I will mourn them when I can. But there are other matters to attend to before that. Chaos is welcome, in doses; it helps keep balance. But this is too much - this is unnatural. It's too late to merely kill this horde's leadership - their forces are already marching. If you want me to help, you need to help me first. You must get ahead of them, muster the defences.\nPlayer: You ask too much of me. I can't help you.",

We discussed in depth the failures of our predecessors and how to avoid them. We understood that if we were to unite, no one could stand in the way of the Dead Three. So unite we did.

In such circumstances, people crave strong leaders. Leaders that bring law, order, and protection. Leaders like me, Bane's unyielding hand, author of justice. You are soon to witness the people of Baldur's Gate granting me complete power over them. All out of fear of the Absolute. Next, I - we - will declare curfew and begin infecting the masses.

A man with the horrid face of a devil, awaiting his future in Hells' blistered army. But I've only now come to see who my true enemy's been.\nPlayer: The archdevil Zariel?\nWyll: So you'd think. But the right answer is much simpler than that: Time. Time is so gods-damned greedy. It can never give, only take. It builds mountains and deserts, only to tear them asunder. It fells armies, it conquers kings, queens - even gods. We blink, and we're gone. And our hopes, our memories, our heart-bonds are gone with us. It even comes for your people in the astral sea. Time may hunt slowly - but it still hunts. Lucky for us, I've found a way to stop it - If just for a moment. Come, let me show you.\nPlayer: We've got big problems to solve, Wyll. Maybe later.\nWyll: A toll of the bell - it's all I ask. Our problems can wait that long.\nPlayer: I couldn't have said it better. Let's go.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: The player takes Wyll's right hand with their left. Wyll smiles and the scene fades out.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: The scene fades back in. Wyll and the player are near the Chionthar, and walk towards a towering and impressive tree. Acorns are scattered underneath it. It is a beautiful night; the moon and stars shine bright.\nWyll: The Wilden Oak. Legend has it it's stood since the Age of Dawn. I used to come here and climb it when father's eye was turned elsewhere - daydream of the stories it might tell, if I listened close enough. The dragon lords sparking the skies above it. The moon elves first plucking the strings of the Weave. Standing here, I feel like I can see into forever.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: The camera moves from the two of you and outwards. A vista of stunning and quiet beauty.\nPlayer: Enjoy the view. Enjoy Wyll's quiet company.\nWyll: I've been thinking a lot about forever. Moreso, I've been thinking everything that comes before - And who I want at my side as it passes.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Wyll kneels to the ground. He takes an acorn and holds it in the palm of his hands, but keeps them close to his body.\nWyll: My mother always said the Wilden Oak's acorns held just a touch of wishing magic. If that be so, then may my greatest wish come true tonight: I love you. Will you be mine - today, and tomorrow, and reaching into eternity?\nPlayer: Gods, no. Have you looked at yourself?

Orin informed us that henceforth she would speak for the temple of Bhaal, and act on their behalf. But she made a mess of things. Unlike you, she cannot control herself.\nKarlach: Hang on. What the fuck is going on here?\nPlayer: How dare Orin take my place. I'll make her pay.\nLord Enver Gortash: Good, good. I can see you are still your old self. When Ketheric fell, I feared the worst. That our plans would fail like so many before. Because of discord among ourselves. Now you've returned, we can achieve all of our dreams still. You brought Thorm's Netherstone. You know, it takes all three to control the brain. Without Thorm's, it's become vexingly wilful. The quakes are a clear warning. If nobody steps in soon, it'll free itself from the authority of the crown. I expect it'll start with turning the Sword Coast's infected - you among them. That Prism of yours won't last indefinitely. Next, the Grand Design. The mind flayer empire reborn. If we're lucky, we'll become slaves. If we're unlucky, well - Not the most thrilling of prospects. But it's a fate that can be avoided if you and I come to an understanding. You may have brought my Steel Watch to its knees - but that's how I know you'd make a most formidable ally. Together we can still restore authority over the brain.\nGROUP_Emperors: Of course.

Better to humour her than make an enemy of all in this place. Lady Shar will understand.\nIsobel: Refreshingly pragmatic of you.

Maybe the process was interrupted.\nHalsin: Perhaps... but I wouldn't want to place all my faith in blind luck. You weren't speaking lightly when you said you needed help. Let me tell you what I know. I've been studying these parasites for a while now. Ever since I discovered these so-called True Souls are infected with them. Someone is using very powerful magic to modify these tadpoles. They are using them to exert control over the infected. I'm sorry to say, I can't undo that magic, which means I can't cure you. But that doesn't mean I can't help. I didn't find what I came here for - a way to remove the tadpoles - but I found the next best thing. I found out where they come from. That must be where these enchantments are placed on them, and it's where you'll find your cure.\nPlayer: How did you come to study mind flayer parasites?\nHalsin: A drow forced me to defend myself. Afterwards, I was able to study the parasite that slithered out of the corpse, see what drives these 'True Souls'. I had no idea anyone beyond their ranks was infected. You have my sincere sympathies.\nPlayer: This magic you mentioned - it isn't normal for these parasites? Then everything we did here was hopeless.\nHalsin: Patience. I can't just snap my fingers... but I know where the solution almost certainly lies. I overheard that the cultists are sending all of their captives to Moonrise Towers. Innocents go in, True Souls come out. Given that all of these True Souls are infected, it has to be the source of this magic. If you want to find a cure, you must head there and discover how the tadpoles are being manipulated.\nPlayer: Altered parasites? A cure at Moonrise Towers, maybe? Sounds like guesswork at best.\nHalsin: I'm as certain as I can be. If you have a better alternative, I won't stop you. I can't stop you, in fact. Which brings me to my next problem... I've no right to ask more of you... but if you could help me, I'd be free to join your journey to Moonrise. I cannot allow these butchers to threaten my grove. The natural order must be protected.\nPlayer: Look around you - there's no order anymore. Only chaos.\nHalsin: Chaos is welcome, in doses; it helps keep balance. But this is too much - this is unnatural. It's too late to merely kill this horde's leadership - their forces are already marching. If you want me to help, you need to help me first. You must get ahead of them, muster the defences.\nPlayer: You ask too much of me. I can't help you.",

She swallows, then begins hacking coughing. The moonlight dissipates. She quickly goes from seeming like a divine spirit to a normal young woman.\nIsobel: I didn't realise I had an audience.\nFist Marcus: Isobel. This is -\nIsobel: A Sharran.\nNarrator: *Isobel. The same name as Ketheric Thorm's daughter - the one whose sarcophagus you found empty in the family mausoleum.*\nPlayer: Push your Urges down. Isobel - Isobel Thorm?\nNarrator: *Her breath catches; you notice a barely-perceptible shudder run through her body.*\nIsobel: An unfortunate coincidence. I hope never to meet the wicked man who haemorrhaged shadows over this peaceful village. I've heard you might be the person to stop him. A True Soul with a soul. Imagine. But if you are who I think you are, I'd be a fool to reject your help. The True Soul with... well, a soul. Imagine.\nPlayer: You seem to have a lot to say about my allegiance. Can we focus on the task at hand?\nIsobel: I suppose that would be wise. We have a common enemy, after all: Ketheric Thorm. You'll be needing the protection spell, I presume? Oh - aren't you looking for a protection spell?\nPlayer: I need nothing from a Selûnite.\nIsobel: But any others who travel with you may not agree. Do it for them at least - you will need all the help you can get out there.\nPlayer: It was nothing. Put it out of your mind.\nNarrator: *But was it truly nothing? The pain gripped you tight, robbing you of all composure for a moment...*\nIsobel: Well! If the Moonmaiden didn't strike me dead for blessing you, she must rather approve of this little alliance. This will block the lesser effects of the shadow curse, allowing you to traverse the darkness outside... should Shar's own protection falter, that is. Curious. Surely the Nightsinger could have shielded all her followers, and made this place her domain long ago... yet she only acts now, and aids you alone. I wonder why.\nPlayer: I don't know what to make of it myself.\nIsobel: I suppose Shar is nothing if not mysterious. I'll stop needling you, though. You have more important things to do, after all.\nPlayer: I've already been to Moonrise, but I have more work to do indeed.\nIsobel: I imagine so, if Jaheira hasn't gone tearing off into the night.\nPlayer: You're coming with me, cleric.",

It does not want to fall into the Absolute's clutches.* *Her mind focuses - the cultists cannot discover that the weapon they seek is within their grasp.* *The drow's mind closes around yours, her bloodlust like needles in your skull.*\nPlayer: The druids' magic protects the grove, but she may be able to break through.\nNightwarden Minthara: My patience wears thin, True Soul. The hunt must begin. Show me the grove. Be my eyes.\nNarrator: *Images of the battle at the gate shimmer into view, along with the adventurers pleading to be let inside.* *Tiefling faces flicker into view as she attempts to learn the grove's location.*\nPlayer: Allow her to read your thoughts.\nNarrator: *She sees the entrance to the grove as the adventurers retreat inside, joining the tieflings...* *...and then smiles serenely as blood and shadow spread like stains across your memory, erasing all that live there.*\nNightwarden Minthara: The cowards found refuge among the desperate. Perfect. If the inhabitants do not realise you are the knife at their throats, we can use that against them. Go to their refuge and make your way inside. As a friend.\nPlayer: I prefer to face my enemies rather than stabbing them in the back.\nNightwarden Minthara: How noble. I prefer to win. I will gather a raiding party and move into position. You will open the gates from the inside when the time is right to strike. We will cleanse the place of infidels and burn it to the ground in the Absolute's name. And then we will be the first among Her favourites.\nNarrator: *The masterful painting she depicts of the massacre awakens you hungrily.*\nPlayer: Reject these dreams of a bloodbath.\nNightwarden Minthara: The Absolute brought you here for a reason - to throw open those gates so we can crush our enemies.\nPlayer: You're right. I'll see you at the grove.",

A man with the horrid face of a devil, awaiting his future in Hells' blistered army. But I've only now come to see who my true enemy's been.\nPlayer: The archdevil Zariel?\nWyll: So you'd think. But the right answer is much simpler than that: Time. Time is so gods-damned greedy. It can never give, only take. My eternal soul is at its mercy. It builds mountains and deserts, only to tear them asunder. It fells armies, it conquers kings, queens - even gods. We blink, and we're gone. And our hopes, our memories, our heart-bonds are gone with us. It even comes for your people in the astral sea. Time may hunt slowly - but it still hunts. Lucky for us, I've found a way to stop it - If just for a moment. Come, let me show you.\nPlayer: Go on - I'll follow.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: The scene fades back in. Wyll and the player are near the Chionthar, and walk towards a towering and impressive tree. Acorns are scattered underneath it. It is a beautiful night; the moon and stars shine bright. NOTE: Karlach CANNOT take Wyll's hand, they shouldn't be touching.See N41\nWyll: The Wilden Oak. Legend has it it's stood since the Age of Dawn. I used to come here and climb it when father's eye was turned elsewhere - daydream of the stories it might tell, if I listened close enough. The dragon lords sparking the skies above it. The moon elves first plucking the strings of the Weave. Standing here, I feel like I can see into forever.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: The camera moves from the two of you and outwards. A vista of stunning and quiet beauty.\nPlayer: Seriously? You dragged me out here to look at a tree?\nWyll: I did. But also to see something else: Me. I've been thinking a lot about forever. Moreso, I've been thinking everything that comes before - And who I want at my side as it passes.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Wyll kneels to the ground. He takes an acorn and holds it in the palm of his hands, but keeps them close to his body.\nWyll: My mother always said the Wilden Oak's acorns held just a touch of wishing magic. If that be so, then may my greatest wish come true tonight: I love you. Will you be mine - today, and tomorrow, and reaching into eternity?\nPlayer: Gods, no. Have you looked at yourself?

Oh - aren't you looking for a protection spell?\nPlayer: I am already protected. My Lady shields me from the curse.\nIsobel: For now, perhaps. But Shar can be fickle, and her love can prove fleeting. Do not turn your back on an advantage you may need... even a Selûnite one. If nothing else, it can aid any companions who travel with you - somehow I doubt Shar's largesse was extended to them.\nPlayer: Ngh... it hurts...\nIsobel: Well! If the Moonmaiden didn't strike me dead for blessing you, she must rather approve of this little alliance. This will block the lesser effects of the shadow curse, allowing you to traverse the darkness outside... should Shar's own protection falter, that is. Curious. Surely the Nightsinger could have shielded all her followers, and made this place her domain long ago... yet she only acts now, and aids you alone. I wonder why.\nPlayer: I don't know what to make of it myself.\nIsobel: I suppose Shar is nothing if not mysterious. I'll stop needling you, though. You have more important things to do, after all.\nPlayer: I've already been to Moonrise, but I have more work to do indeed.\nIsobel: I imagine so, if Jaheira hasn't gone tearing off into the night.\nPlayer: You're coming with me, cleric.",

Is it the tadpole, or a curse? You cannot say.*\nIsobel: Well! If the Moonmaiden didn't strike me dead for blessing you, she must rather approve of this little alliance. This will block the lesser effects of the shadow curse, allowing you to traverse the darkness outside... should Shar's own protection falter, that is. Curious. Surely the Nightsinger could have shielded all her followers, and made this place her domain long ago... yet she only acts now, and aids you alone. I wonder why.\nPlayer: The Dark Lady's works aren't for me to question.\nIsobel: Mustn't question the great shadow mother, must we? I'll stop needling you, though. You have more important things to do, after all.\nPlayer: You're coming with me, cleric.",

Maybe the process was interrupted.\nHalsin: Perhaps... but I wouldn't want to place all my faith in blind luck. You weren't speaking lightly when you said you needed help. Let me tell you what I know. I've been studying these parasites for a while now. Ever since I discovered these so-called True Souls are infected with them.

But that doesn't mean I can't help. I didn't find what I came here for - a way to remove the tadpoles - but I found the next best thing. I found out where they come from. That must be where these enchantments are placed on them, and it's where you'll find your cure.\nPlayer: How did you come to study mind flayer parasites?\nHalsin: A drow forced me to defend myself. Afterwards, I was able to study the parasite that slithered out of the corpse, see what drives these 'True Souls'. I had no idea anyone beyond their ranks was infected. You have my sincere sympathies.\nPlayer: This magic you mentioned - it isn't normal for these parasites? Then everything we did here was hopeless.\nHalsin: Patience. I can't just snap my fingers... but I know where the solution almost certainly lies. I overheard that the cultists are sending all of their captives to Moonrise Towers. Innocents go in, True Souls come out. Given that all of these True Souls are infected, it has to be the source of this magic. If you want to find a cure, you must head there and discover how the tadpoles are being manipulated.\nPlayer: Altered parasites? A cure at Moonrise Towers, maybe? Sounds like guesswork at best.\nHalsin: I'm as certain as I can be. If you have a better alternative, I won't stop you. I can't stop you, in fact. Which brings me to my next problem... I've no right to ask more of you... but if you could help me, I'd be free to join your journey to Moonrise. I cannot allow these butchers to threaten my grove. The natural order must be protected.\nPlayer: All right. How do I help?\nHalsin: My thanks. If you prevail, I'll owe you the debt of a lifetime. Rare is the beast that survives decapitation.

But the right answer is much simpler than that: Time. Time is so gods-damned greedy. It can never give, only take. It builds mountains and deserts, only to tear them asunder. It fells armies, it conquers kings, queens - even gods. We blink, and we're gone. And our hopes, our memories, our heart-bonds are gone with us. It even comes for your people in the astral sea.

The moon elves first plucking the strings of the Weave. Standing here, I feel like I can see into forever.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: The camera moves from the two of you and outwards. A vista of stunning and quiet beauty.\nPlayer: Seriously? You dragged me out here to look at a tree?\nWyll: I did. But also to see something else: Me. I've been thinking a lot about forever. Moreso, I've been thinking everything that comes before - And who I want at my side as it passes.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Wyll kneels to the ground. He takes an acorn and holds it in the palm of his hands, but keeps them close to his body.\nWyll: My mother always said the Wilden Oak's acorns held just a touch of wishing magic.

She swallows, then begins hacking coughing. The moonlight dissipates. She quickly goes from seeming like a divine spirit to a normal young woman.\nIsobel: I didn't realise I had an audience.\nFist Marcus: Isobel. This is -\nIsobel: A Sharran.\nNarrator: *Isobel. The same name as Ketheric Thorm's daughter - the one whose sarcophagus you found empty in the family mausoleum.*\nPlayer: Push your Urges down. You can tell my allegiance from a look?\nIsobel: It's an aura. Or a lack of one, really. Frankly, I'm surprised you're willing to help us.

The True Soul with... well, a soul. Imagine.\nPlayer: You seem to have a lot to say about my allegiance. Can we focus on the task at hand?\nIsobel: I suppose that would be wise. We have a common enemy, after all: Ketheric Thorm. You'll be needing the protection spell, I presume? Oh - aren't you looking for a protection spell?\nPlayer: I am already protected. My Lady shields me from the curse.\nIsobel: For now, perhaps. But Shar can be fickle, and her love can prove fleeting. Do not turn your back on an advantage you may need... even a Selûnite one. If nothing else, it can aid any companions who travel with you - somehow I doubt Shar's largesse was extended to them.\nPlayer: Try to understand what's happening.\nNarrator: *Is Lady Shar punishing you? Or perhaps testing you? Is it the tadpole, or a curse? You cannot say.*\nIsobel: Well! If the Moonmaiden didn't strike me dead for blessing you, she must rather approve of this little alliance. This will block the lesser effects of the shadow curse, allowing you to traverse the darkness outside... should Shar's own protection falter, that is. Curious. Surely the Nightsinger could have shielded all her followers, and made this place her domain long ago... yet she only acts now, and aids you alone. I wonder why.\nPlayer: The Dark Lady's works aren't for me to question.\nIsobel: Mustn't question the great shadow mother, must we? I'll stop needling you, though. You have more important things to do, after all.\nPlayer: I've already been to Moonrise, but I have more work to do indeed.\nIsobel: I imagine so, if Jaheira hasn't gone tearing off into the night.\nPlayer: You're coming with me, cleric.",

But I think the right answer is much simpler than that: Time. Time is so gods-damned greedy. It can never give, only take. It builds mountains and deserts, only to tear them asunder. It fells armies, it conquers kings, queens - even gods. We blink, and we're gone. And our hopes, our memories, our heart-bonds are gone with us. Lucky for us, I've found a way to stop time - If just for a moment. Come, let me show you.\nPlayer: All right. But this better be worth it.\nWyll: It is.

It is a beautiful night; the moon and stars shine bright.\nWyll: The Wilden Oak. Legend has it it's stood since the Age of Dawn. I used to come here and climb it when father's eye was turned elsewhere - daydream of the stories it might tell, if I listened close enough. The dragon lords sparking the skies above it. The moon elves first plucking the strings of the Weave. Standing here, I feel like I can see into forever.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: The camera moves from the two of you and outwards. A vista of stunning and quiet beauty.\nPlayer: Seriously? You dragged me out here to look at a tree?\nWyll: I did. But also to see something else: Me. I've been thinking a lot about forever. Moreso, I've been thinking everything that comes before - And who I want at my side as it passes.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Wyll kneels to the ground. He takes an acorn and holds it in the palm of his hands, but keeps them close to his body.\nWyll: My mother always said the Wilden Oak's acorns held just a touch of wishing magic. If that be so, then may my greatest wish come true tonight: I love you. Will you be mine - today, and tomorrow, and reaching into eternity?\nPlayer: Gods, no. Have you looked at yourself?

Your kind aren't known for their decency - particularly when a Sharran curse is our greatest obstacle. But if you are who I think you are, I'd be a fool to reject your help. The True Soul with... well, a soul. Imagine.\nPlayer: I'm glad you've remembered who needs whose help here.\nIsobel: Oh - aren't you looking for a protection spell?\nPlayer: I need nothing from a Selûnite.\nIsobel: But any others who travel with you may not agree. Do it for them at least - you will need all the help you can get out there.\nPlayer: It was nothing. Put it out of your mind.\nNarrator: *But was it truly nothing? The pain gripped you tight, robbing you of all composure for a moment...*\nIsobel: Well! If the Moonmaiden didn't strike me dead for blessing you, she must rather approve of this little alliance. This will block the lesser effects of the shadow curse, allowing you to traverse the darkness outside... should Shar's own protection falter, that is. Curious. Surely the Nightsinger could have shielded all her followers, and made this place her domain long ago... yet she only acts now, and aids you alone. I wonder why.\nPlayer: The Dark Lady's works aren't for me to question.\nIsobel: Mustn't question the great shadow mother, must we? I'll stop needling you, though. You have more important things to do, after all.\nPlayer: I've already been to Moonrise, but I have more work to do indeed.\nIsobel: I imagine so, if Jaheira hasn't gone tearing off into the night.\nPlayer: You're coming with me, cleric.",

Let me show you.\nPlayer: Sigh and brace yourself.\nMizora: What's the matter. Don't you trust me?\nNarrator: *An inferno engulfs you. Your lust blazes hot.*\nMizora: Do you feel it? Avernus. Where Hells' legions march, screaming their rage. Where the Styx collects the blood of the fallen. Where your rightful mistress shoulders the burdens of perpetual war. Reach out. Have a taste.\nPlayer: Give it to me.\nNarrator: *The flavour is exquisite as spiced wine, terrible as rotting offal. It does not quench your lust - it only stokes it.*\n\nThe player makes a fist, the flame extinguishes, but in doing so a new flood of sensation rushes into their core. Their back and neck arch slightly as they breath deep.\nMizora: Don't worry, pet. I won't leave 'til you're fully satisfied. Dis, the blackened elysium. Minauros, the rotting bog. The molten seas and soil of Phlegethos. Stygia, the frozen ocean. Choose a Hell. Have your fill.\nPlayer: The barren wastes of Dis.\nNarrator: *Suffering. It rises from the foul ichor of the vast plains of Dis. The pain of the damned is your pleasure. Your soul cries for more, more, more.*\n\nThe player extends both arms out toward the flames, palms down. Their eyes close as they connect with Mizora's hellish offerings.\n\nShe watches as the pleasure rides out the sensations.\nMizora: To think how you've starved yourself up to this moment. To think how you chose the sweet over the bitter. One last choice, and starve no longer. Malbolge, the desolation. The forgotten ruins of Maladomini. Cania and its mountains of ice. Or Nessus, the seat of infernal power.\nPlayer: Cania, realm of glaciers.\nNarrator: *Ice. Its embrace is tighter than any you've known. It is cold, but you want colder. You want total zero.*\n\nThe player player rotates their palms upward, and look up, basking in the arcane sensory experience.\nInternalNodeContext: Cannot be aliased due to VFX coloration and narration, anims resued though.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: The player turns and faces Mizora.

He and I have history.\nJaheira: You were the one who rescued those the Absolute had imprisoned. You were courageous to brave the depths of Ketheric's stronghold. I suppose you know about Ketheric, then. His invincibility. That we'll never cleanse this place until he's made to bleed. We met him on the road here - commanding an army of the Absolute, intent on destroying Baldur's Gate. I put an arrow through his eye myself, only to watch him pluck it out like a splinter. He healed right in front of me, and chased us into the shadows. Things looked hopeless, but experience has taught me that no matter how bleak things look, there's always hope. You are that hope.\nPlayer: What do you have in mind?\nJaheira: Protected by your artefact, you can infiltrate his forces at Moonrise Towers, posing as a True Soul.

Not an entirely unpromising specimen, for one naturally-born.\nNodeContext: Begrudging and largely hostile, but with a hint of appreciation for the player's skill in actually making it this far.\nBalthazar: Not just any True Soul would have succeeded in following my path through this place. You should be pleased. I take it the breaking of my skeletons was an accident - the living are so clumsy, after all.\nPlayer: I'm pleased to be of service, Balthazar.\nBalthazar: Perhaps you can prove to me that you're more useful alive than dead. You know what's at stake here, I take it? But you're here now, and I may be able to put those limbs to work. You know what's at stake here, I take it?\nPlayer: Judging by how you're cowering in here, your survival?\nBalthazar: I do not cower - I plan. I command. I create. General Thorm trusts me. He knows I will deliver. He knows I will stand by him long after all others wilt and fall. You, Z'rell, all the rest... you have only one body with which to serve. I have as many as I care to make.\nPlayer: Yet you seem no closer to retrieving the Nightsong? I read your notes - very interesting.\nBalthazar: Interesting, and private. Give me one reason why I shouldn't have my creations kill you right now, thief.\nPlayer: Do it - unleash your creations. But they will not protect you from me - or my righteous fury. You're hiding from shadows - literally. Don't make threats you can't back up.\nBalthazar: ...Fine. I'll forgive your transgressions this time - there are much grander things at stake.\nNodeContext: A pause before 'fine' - weighing up the player's fate.\nBalthazar: The Nightsong is my finest creation - if I never exceed myself, I will still die happy. Not that I ever intend to do something as gauche as truly dying, of course. Now, given your prying nature, I have work for you, as a scout. The Nightsong lends the General his strength, his invulnerability. It must be recovered, before his enemies attempt to exploit it.\nPlayer: You need my help?\nBalthazar: I do not need you, or your help. But you are here in spite of that, so I may as well make use of you. The Nightsong is close, but the way is barred and Shar's dead are... uncooperative. Clear the path for me - by blade, cunning, or whatever it takes. I will remain here until you have succeeded, or fallen.\nShadowheart: I'd trust this gasbag about as far as I can throw him - which isn't far. But perhaps better to play along, for now.\nPlayer: You have resources to spare - give me something to aid my search.\nBalthazar: Fine. I will assign Flesh to aid you on your way. Ring this bell... ...and he will come. My brother is no intellectual powerhouse, but he is strong, loyal and punctual. Should a fight turn against you, remember the bell.\nPlayer: Actually, I have your mother.\nBalthazar: What the...? Give me back my mother, this instant!\nPlayer: Return Balthazar's mother.\nBalthazar: Good. And keep your hands to yourself in future.\nNodeContext: Cooling down (player has returned the jar containing his dead mother)\nBalthazar: My brother is no intellectual powerhouse, but he is strong, loyal and punctual. Should a fight turn against you, remember the bell.\nPlayer: Keep it - this is your problem, not mine.\nBalthazar: This is not a problem - it is an opportunity. And it is not a choice either - you will obey.\nPlayer: Fine. I'll see what I can do. I'll see what I can do.",

Aradin's a blowhard, but that's no cause for me to join him. Thank you for your help out there. I'm Zevlor. And if I'm not mistaken, you're the Blade of Frontiers.\nPlayer: What is this place?\nZevlor: A druids' grove, dedicated to the Oak Father, Silvanus. You'll find its keepers just as thorny, I fear. Whatever your business, I'd see to it quickly - the druids are forcing everyone out. This attack will only strengthen their resolve.\nPlayer: Why are they forcing you out?\nZevlor: There have been several attacks by different monsters. The druids blame us 'outsiders' for drawing them here. Nobody's welcome anymore. They've started a ritual to cut the grove off from the world outside. We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: What brought you here?\nZevlor: We're refugees from Elturel - we took shelter here after gnolls attacked us on the road. We were bound for Baldur's Gate, and it was too late to turn back. Elturel had no place for tieflings after the Descent.\nPlayer: Is there a place for tieflings anywhere?\nZevlor: Hah - a fair point. We can only hope the citizens of Baldur's Gate are more open-minded. But we can't get there with those beasts blocking our path. We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: This ritual - is there no way to convince the druids to stop it?\nZevlor: I've tried. Kagha - their new First Druid - won't even see me. You, though... I know it's not your business, but she owes you for saving this place. Perhaps you could persuade her. For more time to prepare, if nothing else.\nPlayer: I have my own temporal concerns. I need a healer. Enough about the ritual. I have my own problems.",

I take it the breaking of my skeletons was an accident - the living are so clumsy, after all.\nPlayer: I'm pleased to be of service, Balthazar.\nBalthazar: Perhaps you can prove to me that you're more useful alive than dead. You know what's at stake here, I take it? But you're here now, and I may be able to put those limbs to work. You know what's at stake here, I take it?\nPlayer: Judging by how you're cowering in here, your survival?\nBalthazar: I do not cower - I plan. I command. I create. General Thorm trusts me. He knows I will deliver. He knows I will stand by him long after all others wilt and fall. You and all the rest have only one body with which to serve. I have as many as I care to make. You, Z'rell, all the rest... you have only one body with which to serve. I have as many as I care to make.\nPlayer: Yet you seem no closer to retrieving the Nightsong? I read your notes - very interesting.\nBalthazar: Interesting, and private. Give me one reason why I shouldn't have my creations kill you right now, thief.\nPlayer: You are a ship without a sail, necromancer. You need allies - you need me. It's simple - you need me. Don't pretend otherwise.\nBalthazar: ...Fine. Your usefulness may outweigh your insolence - for now. There are much grander things at stake.\nNodeContext: A pause before 'fine' - weighing up the player's fate.\nBalthazar: The Nightsong is my finest creation - if I never exceed myself, I will still die happy. Not that I ever intend to do something as gauche as truly dying, of course. Now, given your prying nature, I have work for you, as a scout. The Nightsong lends the General his strength, his invulnerability. It must be recovered, before his enemies attempt to exploit it.\nPlayer: Sounds like you've good reason to be proud of the Nightsong - tell me more.\nBalthazar: And spoil the surprise? I think not. But let's just say that the Nightsong was a unique specimen even before I began my work... Words - even my words - are woefully insufficient. When you see for yourself, you will understand.\nPlayer: What do you need me to do?\nBalthazar: I do not need you, or your help. But you are here in spite of that, so I may as well make use of you. The Nightsong is close, but the way is barred and Shar's dead are... uncooperative. Clear the path for me - by blade, cunning, or whatever it takes. I will remain here until you have succeeded, or fallen.\nShadowheart: I'd trust this gasbag about as far as I can throw him - which isn't far. But perhaps better to play along, for now.\nPlayer: This sounds like your problem, not mine. Keep it - this is your problem, not mine.\nBalthazar: This is not a problem - it is an opportunity. And it is not a choice either - you will obey.\nPlayer: Fine. I'll see what I can do. I'll see what I can do.",

We surrendered, but that wasn't enough for them. They lined us up like dogs. Asharak was with the kids, telling them it was gonna be all right. Maybe that's why they picked him. Told him to kneel... They took his eyes first. Then his tongue.\nPlayer: I'm so sorry.\nAlfira: It just... it just never stops. Rolan, of all people, saved us. He said he stayed in the grove because of you, and I'm damn glad of it. Without him... well, none of us would be here.\nPlayer: What did the cultists do to the others?\nAlfira: I don't know. It just... happened so quickly. How do you do it? How do you keep going?\nPlayer: Just take it one step at a time.\nAlfira: You make it sound so easy - but I'll try. You've done so much for us already, but I have to ask - the others might still be out there. If they're not dead, they're in Moonrise. And gods have mercy on anyone in that hellspit.\nPlayer: I imagine the cultists are torturing them right now.",

And you're...?\nPlayer: I'm [GEN_PlayerName_c11eee1e-7815-6143-7233-f2427799fa53].\nZevlor: Well met. Though I should warn you - visitors are no longer welcome in this grove. Whatever your business here, I'd see to it quickly - the druids are forcing everyone out. This latest attack will only strengthen their resolve.\nPlayer: Why are they forcing you out?\nZevlor: There have been several attacks by different monsters. The druids blame us 'outsiders' for drawing them here. Nobody's welcome anymore. They've started a ritual to cut the grove off from the world outside. We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: What brought you here?\nZevlor: We're refugees from Elturel - we took shelter here after goblins and gnolls attacked us on the road. We were bound for Baldur's Gate, and it was too late to turn back. Elturel had no place for tieflings after the Descent.\nNarrator: *You remember it. Elturel and all its citizens were dragged into Avernus - then back out again.*\nPlayer: Let me guess: Your old neighbours called you 'devilkin' and acted like they never knew you.\nZevlor: How easily such a nasty word slips through the mouth of someone you thought you knew. We thought we'd found sanctuary here, but the druids have determined to turn us out. We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: What brought you here?\nZevlor: We're refugees from Elturel - we took shelter here after goblins and gnolls attacked us on the road. We were bound for Baldur's Gate, and it was too late to turn back. Elturel had no place for tieflings after the Descent.\nPlayer: You made it back from Avernus. Surely you can survive anything?\nZevlor: So I hoped. But we've lost so many already - and more will die if we're forced out again. We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: What brought you here?\nZevlor: We're refugees from Elturel - we took shelter here after goblins and gnolls attacked us on the road. We were bound for Baldur's Gate, and it was too late to turn back. Elturel had no place for tieflings after the Descent.\nPlayer: That's sad - but it doesn't mean the druids owe you sanctuary.\nZevlor: It seems you're of a mind with our hosts here. But their ritual will force you out, too. We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: Leave.",

I take it the breaking of my skeletons was an accident - the living are so clumsy, after all.\nPlayer: I'm pleased to be of service, Balthazar.\nBalthazar: Perhaps you can prove to me that you're more useful alive than dead. You know what's at stake here, I take it? But you're here now, and I may be able to put those limbs to work. You know what's at stake here, I take it?\nPlayer: Enlighten me. Fine, consider your merits acknowledged. Care to enlighten me as to what's going on?\nBalthazar: There is a relic here. One which General Thorm desires. No - needs. I will retrieve it for him... ...and you will help me. Ignorant you may be, you've shown some prowess in scouting and combat by making it this far. While you, an infinitely more humble servant, fulfil my command. I will put you to work - as a scout.\nNarrator: *This necromancer has Ketheric's trust. Helping him could be just what you need to gain access to the man himself.*\nPlayer: A scout is little good if they don't know what to look for. What does this relic do? I need more to go on. Why is this relic so important? What does it do?\nBalthazar: Telling you will not make the task any less perilous. Just obey, and use your ignorance as a shield. You should be adept at that already. The Nightsong lends the General his strength, his invulnerability. It must be recovered, before his enemies attempt to exploit it.\nPlayer: Sounds like you've good reason to be proud of the Nightsong - tell me more.\nBalthazar: And spoil the surprise? I think not. But let's just say that the Nightsong was a unique specimen even before I began my work... Words - even my words - are woefully insufficient. When you see for yourself, you will understand.\nPlayer: What do you need me to do?\nBalthazar: I do not need you, or your help. But you are here in spite of that, so I may as well make use of you. The relic is close, but the way is barred and Shar's dead are... uncooperative. Clear the path for me - by blade, cunning, or whatever it takes. I will remain here until you have succeeded, or fallen.\nShadowheart: I'd trust this gasbag about as far as I can throw him - which isn't far. But perhaps better to play along, for now.\nPlayer: You have resources to spare - give me something to aid my search.\nBalthazar: Fine. I will assign Flesh to aid you on your way. Ring this bell... ...and he will come. My brother is no intellectual powerhouse, but he is strong, loyal and punctual. Should a fight turn against you, remember the bell.\nPlayer: Keep it - this is your problem, not mine.\nBalthazar: This is not a problem - it is an opportunity. And it is not a choice either - you will obey.\nPlayer: Fine. I'll see what I can do. I'll see what I can do.",

Your words seem to have piqued her curiosity.*\nGROUP_Act3_LOW_HouseOfHope_Hope: Who am I? It's my favourite question. I scream it into the dark while I sleep, and whisper it to my memories when I wake. I'm the thing that kills you, and the only reason you're alive. Made by a promise, undone by the truth. A handshake, a hug, the first beat of a newborn's heart. I am Hope. What little is left of her. A GUTTERING CANDLE IN A UNIVERSE OF NIGHT\nKarlach: Raphael's driven her mad. Poor soul.\nGROUP_Act3_LOW_HouseOfHope_Hope: I'm not much of a friend to anyone anymore. But I could use a friend myself. Do you want a friend to guide you through this madhouse? Shhhtttt, I hear the jailor, it hears me. It'll call Raphael. Make every question count. Make some of them count twice.\nLae'zel: You must ask of the Orphic Hammer. Without it, the Prince of the Comet - and the githyanki people - remain forever chained.\n: NodeContext: urgent hushing and frantically getting out all of her words as quickly as possible.

I'll hold him down while you trim his arteries. EXCEPT HE'S NOT HOME I'M INDISPOSED AND YOU'RE IN HELL Don't waste any more words, or we'll both be sorry. The House is home to many things. Most of them really want to kill you. I strongly suggest you try not to let that happen. Find your contract instead - save your soul!\nNarrator: *You hear a sound like the rattle of a chain, and an agonising scream in your head as Hope flickers from view momentarily.*\nGROUP_Act3_LOW_HouseOfHope_Hope: Shhhhttttt... Quiet... There it goes... Everyone here is mad - even you, especially me - and that makes them dangerous. But it also makes them stupid. I'll make you seem as ruined as the rest of the people here. A simple glamour to make you a terrible wretch.\nNodeContext: very enthusiastic, casting a spell to disguise the player\nGROUP_Act3_LOW_HouseOfHope_Hope: Now whisper your questions, little wretch.

Quiet as a mouse.\nPlayer: Where is Raphael?\nGROUP_Act3_LOW_HouseOfHope_Hope: BEHIND YOU Skipping across the planes, spinning plates, making deals with dukes and devils. He's a busy man. A business-man. But not a man at all, of course. He'll be home soon, though, and you better find the Hammer before he arrives. Remember. Quiet as a mouse.\nPlayer: Where will I find my contract?\nGROUP_Act3_LOW_HouseOfHope_Hope: THE SAME PLACE YOU'LL FIND YOUR SORRY LITTLE SOUL WHEN RAPHAEL RIPS IT OUT The paper cage for your soul. Such a tiny thing, but it's one of his favourites. In the Archive. Down the corridor, past the debtors. OH! The debtors. They won't like you. But I like you. I know I do, I think I do, I hope I do.

We were bound for Baldur's Gate, and it was too late to turn back. Elturel had no place for tieflings after the Descent.\nNarrator: *You remember it. Elturel and all its citizens were dragged into Avernus - then back out again.*\nPlayer: Let me guess: Your old neighbours called you 'devilkin' and acted like they never knew you.\nZevlor: How easily such a nasty word slips through the mouth of someone you thought you knew. We thought we'd found sanctuary here, but the druids have determined to turn us out. We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: What brought you here?\nZevlor: We're refugees from Elturel - we took shelter here after goblins and gnolls attacked us on the road. We were bound for Baldur's Gate, and it was too late to turn back. Elturel had no place for tieflings after the Descent.\nNarrator: *'The Descent' - an infernal conspiracy that had seen the entire city of Elturel briefly dragged to the Hells.*\nPlayer: Maybe your people should have stayed in Hell.\nZevlor: It seems you're of a mind with our hosts here. But their ritual will force you out, too. We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: This ritual - is there no way to convince the druids to stop it?\nZevlor: I've tried. Kagha - their new First Druid - won't see me. You, though... I know it's not your business, but she owes you for saving this place. Perhaps you could persuade her. For more time to prepare, if nothing else.\nPlayer: I have my own temporal concerns. I need a healer. Enough about the ritual. I have my own problems. I'm sorry. I've got my own problems.",

Vlaakith offers something resembling a smile, and gestures for the player to rise. The player rises.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Vlaakith looms in to face the player at their eye level.\nVlaakith: You bear that which is ours. But are you friend, or are you thief?\nPlayer: Friend - I came to bring it back to you.\nAstarion: You're what? That is the only thing keeping us from a gruesome, tentacled-filled future.\nVlaakith: An unexpected servant. Your will is strong. Your kind is not known for trusting strangers. Quite rightly. Yet here you are. Extend your fealty one step further, and you will be rewarded beyond your mortal reckoning. The Astral Prism - it is corrupted.\nCh'r'ai W'wargaz: I shall cleanse it for you, my queen. Tell me how.\nInternalNodeContext: He's not altogether sure why this task is falling to the player and not to him, but also doesn't want to challenge his queen's motivations.\nVlaakith: SILENCE, W'wargaz. There is someone inside. Their mind is warped, broken - a blight. They are an agent of the Grand Design. Sent to sabotage the Astral Prism - our last defence against the return of the Illithid Empire. As long as they live, the Prism is compromised. Find the one inside and kill them. Be aware - they are not alone, and they will appeal to your trust. They are not to be believed. You must accept. Refuse, and know my fury.\nPlayer: So the dream visitor is inside the artefact... I can't kill them. They protect me from the Absolute.\nVlaakith: You are being LIED TO. I WILL BE OBEYED!\nNodeContext: she loses herself a bit in rage here,\nPlayer: Fine. I will go in and kill them.",

You should be pleased. I take it the breaking of my skeletons was an accident - the living are so clumsy, after all.\nPlayer: I'm pleased to be of service, Balthazar.\nBalthazar: Perhaps you can prove to me that you're more useful alive than dead. You know what's at stake here, I take it? But you're here now, and I may be able to put those limbs to work. You know what's at stake here, I take it?\nPlayer: Judging by how you're cowering in here, your survival?\nBalthazar: I do not cower - I plan. I command. I create. General Thorm trusts me. He knows I will deliver. He knows I will stand by him long after all others wilt and fall. You, Z'rell, all the rest... you have only one body with which to serve. I have as many as I care to make.\nPlayer: Fine, consider your merits acknowledged. Care to enlighten me as to what's going on?\nBalthazar: There is a relic here. One which General Thorm desires. No - needs. I will retrieve it for him... ...and you will help me. Ignorant you may be, you've shown some prowess in scouting and combat by making it this far. While you, an infinitely more humble servant, fulfil my command. I will put you to work - as a scout.\nNarrator: *This necromancer has Ketheric's trust. Helping him might just be the best way to gain access to Moonrise Towers.* *This necromancer has Ketheric's trust. Helping him could be just what you need to gain access to the man himself.*\nPlayer: A scout is little good if they don't know what to look for. What does this relic do? I need more to go on. Why is this relic so important? What does it do?\nBalthazar: Telling you will not make the task any less perilous. Just obey, and use your ignorance as a shield. You should be adept at that already. The Nightsong lends the General his strength, his invulnerability. It must be recovered, before his enemies attempt to exploit it.\nPlayer: You need my help?\nBalthazar: I do not need you, or your help. But you are here in spite of that, so I may as well make use of you. The relic is close, but the way is barred and Shar's dead are... uncooperative. Clear the path for me - by blade, cunning, or whatever it takes. I will remain here until you have succeeded, or fallen.\nShadowheart: I'd trust this gasbag about as far as I can throw him - which isn't far. But perhaps better to play along, for now.\nPlayer: For jobs like this it's good form to provide your operatives some extra resources.\nBalthazar: Fine. I will assign Flesh to aid you on your way. Ring this bell... ...Hmm. Misplaced, it seems. You will be capable enough without it.\nPlayer: I'll see what I can do.",

Tell me, what can the Society do for you?\nPlayer: I carry an unhatched githyanki egg. Would you be interested in studying it?\nHavkelaag: A githyanki egg? What a fortuitous turn of events. I've been attempting to get my hands on one for some time now. Would you consider parting with it? The Society's coffers are deep enough to cover any expenses accrued in its retrieval, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: Chk. Don't you dare consider it.\nPlayer: What are you going to do with it?\nHavkelaag: Study it, of course. Your kind have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months. Most on this plane believe you to be innately cruel, violent beings. Evil, if you will. As citizens of the Underdark, we face similar stigmas. Totally unfounded, of course - our natures are as unfixed as any who walk the surface. I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: What does this 'intellectually stimulating' upbringing look like?\nHavkelaag: In the literal sense, I will need to induce the egg to hatch via the application of certain currents to the creature inside. Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue. Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: Why follow the dogma of a draconic god?\nHavkelaag: In my years of study, they're the closest I've found to moral perfection. Only under such rigorous 'goodness' will the subject stand a chance of being cured. My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: Your findings are irrelevant, as are the opinions of all on this kaincha plane.\nHavkelaag: Ah. A display of the well-known githyanki arrogance. I am not sure my experiment can cure that particular affliction, but give me time and I will find a way. Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg? ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: A gith hatchling is not a lab rat! This shka'keth should be bled dry for the mere suggestion.\nPlayer: Sell the egg.\nHavkelaag: Ah. Unfortunately, it seems I've mislaid my purse. I don't suppose you'd consider simply donating it to the Society instead?\nPlayer: Fine. Here you go.",

I take it the breaking of my skeletons was an accident - the living are so clumsy, after all.\nPlayer: I'm pleased to be of service, Balthazar.\nBalthazar: Perhaps you can prove to me that you're more useful alive than dead. You know what's at stake here, I take it? But you're here now, and I may be able to put those limbs to work. You know what's at stake here, I take it?\nPlayer: Judging by how you're cowering in here, your survival?\nBalthazar: I do not cower - I plan. I command. I create. General Thorm trusts me. He knows I will deliver. He knows I will stand by him long after all others wilt and fall. You, Z'rell, all the rest... you have only one body with which to serve. I have as many as I care to make.\nPlayer: Yet you seem no closer to retrieving the Nightsong? I read your notes - very interesting.\nBalthazar: Interesting, and private. Give me one reason why I shouldn't have my creations kill you right now, thief.\nPlayer: Sir, I am a jack-of-all-trades and a master of many. Our meeting was not by chance - you need me. It's simple - you need me. Don't pretend otherwise.\nBalthazar: ...Fine. Your usefulness may outweigh your insolence - for now. There are much grander things at stake.\nNodeContext: A pause before 'fine' - weighing up the player's fate.\nBalthazar: The Nightsong is my finest creation - if I never exceed myself, I will still die happy. Not that I ever intend to do something as gauche as truly dying, of course. Now, given your prying nature, I have work for you, as a scout. The Nightsong lends the General his strength, his invulnerability. It must be recovered, before his enemies attempt to exploit it.\nPlayer: Sounds like you've good reason to be proud of the Nightsong - tell me more.\nBalthazar: And spoil the surprise? I think not. But let's just say that the Nightsong was a unique specimen even before I began my work... Words - even my words - are woefully insufficient. When you see for yourself, you will understand.\nPlayer: What do you need me to do?\nBalthazar: I do not need you, or your help. But you are here in spite of that, so I may as well make use of you. The Nightsong is close, but the way is barred and Shar's dead are... uncooperative. Clear the path for me - by blade, cunning, or whatever it takes. I will remain here until you have succeeded, or fallen.\nShadowheart: I'd trust this gasbag about as far as I can throw him - which isn't far. But perhaps better to play along, for now.\nPlayer: You have resources to spare - give me something to aid my search.\nBalthazar: Fine. I will assign Flesh to aid you on your way. Ring this bell... ...Hmm. Misplaced, it seems. You will be capable enough without it.\nPlayer: This sounds like your problem, not mine. Keep it - this is your problem, not mine.\nBalthazar: This is not a problem - it is an opportunity. And it is not a choice either - you will obey.\nPlayer: Fine. I'll see what I can do. I'll see what I can do.",

He said he stayed in the grove because of you, and I'm damn glad of it. Without him... well, none of us would be here.\nPlayer: Rolan? The apprentice wizard?\nAlfira: Yes. He shielded me and the kids while his brother and sister rushed the cultists. Cal and Lia were dragged away, along with the others. Rolan isn't... taking it so well. None of us, to be honest. How do you do it? How do you keep going?\nPlayer: To linger in the past is to condemn our future. Focus on the here and now.\nAlfira: You make it sound so easy - but I'll try. You've done so much for us already, but I have to ask - the others might still be out there. If they're not dead, they're in Moonrise. And gods have mercy on anyone in that hellspit.\nPlayer: I imagine the cultists are torturing them right now.",

We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: What brought you here?\nZevlor: We're refugees from Elturel - we took shelter here after goblins and gnolls attacked us on the road. We were bound for Baldur's Gate, and it was too late to turn back. Elturel had no place for tieflings after the Descent.\nPlayer: Is there a place for tieflings anywhere?\nZevlor: Hah - a fair point. We can only hope the citizens of Baldur's Gate are more open-minded. But we can't get there with those beasts blocking our path. We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: This ritual - is there no way to convince the druids to stop it?\nZevlor: I've tried. Kagha - their new First Druid - won't see me. You, though... I know it's not your business, but she owes you for saving this place. Perhaps you could persuade her. For more time to prepare, if nothing else.\nPlayer: I'm sorry. I've got my own problems.",

She'll have the stuff to blow that tunnel wide open and get Beldron and the rest out.\nAstarion: Well, some explosives would certainly help us free Thulla's friends.

It is clear, now, that he was not working alone.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Leaves throne, standing from here on\nNightwarden Minthara: During my time in the cult, I came to know one of his co-conspirators all too well - Bhaal's blood-letter, Orin. I know one of them all too well - Bhaal's blood-letter, Orin. To think I thought her to be speaking for the Absolute. I worshipped that woman.\nPlayer: So it's personal? Good - let's take her down.\nNightwarden Minthara: You make it sound so simple. She is the Chosen of Bhaal, Lord of Murder, and one of the cult's founders. Indeed, she is the one who indoctrinated me with the Absolute's lies.\nPlayer: What do you remember of your indoctrination?\nNightwarden Minthara: When I first visited Moonrise, I stood before the Absolute in awe. It was more of an idea than an entity. Pure love. Total power. Orin was by my side. She told me that god had chosen me to be a True Soul. Blessed and adored. Now I know that those memories are lies. There was no god. Orin held me down in a cocoon of flesh, while a mind flayer forced a parasite into my brain. And she laughed at my fear. I will find her, I will murder her. And I will smile.\nPlayer: We'll be heroes - the saviours of Baldur's Gate.\nNightwarden Minthara: Let them think that. There is a short path from saviour to ruler - a short and bloody path. I know it well, and we will walk it together. But Baldur's Gate is a mere bauble. We have the chance to seize something much greater. Surely you see it? In killing Ketheric, we fractured the cult's leadership. When we break the other Chosen and claim their Netherstones, we can take control.\nPlayer: Stealing an entire cult is a new one, even for me.\nNightwarden Minthara: In the long history of these Realms, few people have attempted anything so bold. We may fail, but we must try. The power of the enslaved elder brain could reshape the world. We could reshape the world.\nPlayer: I fear we could lose everything if we try to take control.\nNightwarden Minthara: Nothing worthwhile ever came without loss. But together we have the strength to decide who loses. And to make sure it is not us. You are not stupid. When we reach Baldur's Gate and face the other Chosen, you will see that my way is the right one.\nPlayer: You may be right. I'll keep an open mind.\nNightwarden Minthara: That is all I ask. And remember, I know when your mind is closed. We are bound, then, to travel together, even if we do not yet agree on our ultimate purpose. There is yet one thing about you that troubles me, though. Something I need you to explain. When we killed the tieflings, at the grove, I was not in control of my actions. You do not have that excuse. So I ask you - why? Why kill them?\nPlayer: To watch them suffer - I need no other reason than that.",

It must be recovered, before his enemies attempt to exploit it.\nPlayer: You need my help?\nBalthazar: I do not need you, or your help. But you are here in spite of that, so I may as well make use of you. The Nightsong is close, but the way is barred and Shar's dead are... uncooperative.

Tell me, what can the Society do for you?\nPlayer: I met an expeditioner claiming to work for you. She sought a githyanki egg.\nHavkelaag: Yes, dear Lady Esther. One of our most reliable contractors, though unfortunately this particular request was too much even for her. I believe she quite lost her senses over the task. She came here insisting I purchase an owlbear egg from her, of all things. I don't suppose you've stumbled across any githyanki eggs during your travels? The Society will compensate you for any we purchase, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54]) Would you consider parting with it? The Society's coffers are deep enough to cover any expenses accrued in its retrieval, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: Chk. Don't you dare consider it.\nPlayer: What are you going to do with it?\nHavkelaag: Study it, of course. Your kind have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months. Most on this plane believe you to be innately cruel, violent beings. Evil, if you will. As citizens of the Underdark, we face similar stigmas. Totally unfounded, of course - our natures are as unfixed as any who walk the surface. I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: So the child inside will be experimented on?\nHavkelaag: Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue. Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: What's the Ptarian code?\nHavkelaag: A series of moral imperatives bestowed by the great dragon-deity Bahamut. In my years of study, they're the closest I've found to moral perfection. Only under such rigorous 'goodness' will the subject stand a chance of being cured. My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: Sounds pointless. Public opinion will hardly be swayed by such a small experiment.\nHavkelaag: Not at first. But if the experiment proves successful, it must be repeated. Only then will we know if the findings are to be trusted. Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg? ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: A gith hatchling is not a lab rat! This shka'keth should be bled dry for the mere suggestion.\nPlayer: Sell the egg.\nHavkelaag: Ah. Unfortunately, it seems I've mislaid my purse. I don't suppose you'd consider simply donating it to the Society instead?\nPlayer: Fine. Here you go.",

    "conversation": "Havkelaag: Ah, a surface dweller. You find yourself in the cradle of all knowledge relating to the Underdark: the Society of Brilliance. Tell me, what can the Society do for you?\nPlayer: I met an expeditioner claiming to work for you. She sought a githyanki egg.\nHavkelaag: Yes, dear Lady Esther. One of our most reliable contractors, though unfortunately this particular request was too much even for her. I believe she quite lost her senses over the task. She came here insisting I purchase an owlbear egg from her, of all things. I don't suppose you've stumbled across any githyanki eggs during your travels? The Society will compensate you for any we purchase, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54]) Would you consider parting with it? The Society's coffers are deep enough to cover any expenses accrued in its retrieval, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: Chk. Don't you dare consider it.\nPlayer: What are you going to do with it?\nHavkelaag: Study it, of course. The githyanki have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months. You are no doubt aware that citizens of the Underdark are held in great suspicion by those who live above ground. Many believe us to be 'evil'. The githyanki face similar prejudice, but I believe, if hatched in a less violent, more intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome its evil predispositions. I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: You assume my people are evil, yet your research is built on sheer superstition.\nHavkelaag: Enough of your kind have wreaked destruction on this plane for me to be confident in my assertion. When I have a suitable sample for my study, I will, however, prove that the effects of their biological inclination are reversible. Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue. Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: You would teach the child virtue, but rear it without patience. Curious.\nHavkelaag: Tell me, then, philosopher - if patience delays the fostering of the other virtues, can it be rightly called virtuous?\nPlayer: By your words, any virtue delaying patience would itself be unvirtuous.\nHavkelaag: And therein lies your fault: you would have us argue in circles until the egg hatches naturally. Time we do not have. My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: Sounds pointless. Public opinion will hardly be swayed by such a small experiment.\nHavkelaag: Not at first. But if the experiment proves successful, it must be repeated. Only then will we know if the findings are to be trusted. Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg? ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: A gith hatchling is not a lab rat! This shka'keth should be bled dry for the mere suggestion.\nPlayer: Sell the egg.",

Thank you for your help out there. I'm Zevlor. And if I'm not mistaken, you're the Blade of Frontiers.\nPlayer: Please - it's just Wyll.\nZevlor: Well met, by whatever name. Though I'm afraid that's all the welcome we can give you. Whatever your business, I'd see to it quickly - the druids are forcing everyone out. This attack will only strengthen their resolve.\nPlayer: Those goblins - have there been many attacks like that?\nZevlor: There have been several attacks by different monsters. The druids blame us 'outsiders' for drawing them here. Nobody's welcome anymore. They've started a ritual to cut the grove off from the world outside. We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: What brought you here?\nZevlor: We're refugees from Elturel - we took shelter here after gnolls attacked us on the road. We were bound for Baldur's Gate, and it was too late to turn back. Elturel had no place for tieflings after the Descent.\nNarrator: *You remember it. Elturel and all its citizens were dragged into Avernus - then back out again.*\nPlayer: Let me guess: Your old neighbours called you 'devilkin' and acted like they never knew you.\nZevlor: How easily such a nasty word slips through the mouth of someone you thought you knew. We thought we'd found sanctuary here, but the druids have determined to turn us out. We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: What brought you here?\nZevlor: We're refugees from Elturel - we took shelter here after gnolls attacked us on the road. We were bound for Baldur's Gate, and it was too late to turn back. Elturel had no place for tieflings after the Descent.\nNarrator: *You remember it. Elturel and all its citizens were dragged into Avernus - then back out again.*\nPlayer: Found sanctuary here, did you?\nZevlor: So I hoped. But we've lost so many already - and more will die if we're forced out again. We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: This ritual - is there no way to convince the druids to stop it?\nZevlor: I've tried. Kagha - their new First Druid - won't even see me. You, though... I know it's not your business, but she owes you for saving this place. Perhaps you could persuade her. For more time to prepare, if nothing else.\nPlayer: I have my own temporal concerns. I need a healer. Enough about the ritual. I have my own problems.",

I shall walk that path with you.\nPlayer: I hoped you would - we make a good team. And I'll never tire of killing their previous occupants. We make a good team.\nNightwarden Minthara: My blood ran hot when we broke Ketheric's bones together. But we have greater challenges ahead of us. It is clear, now, that he was not working alone.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Leaves throne, standing from here on\nNightwarden Minthara: During my time in the cult, I came to know one of his co-conspirators all too well - Bhaal's blood-letter, Orin. I know one of them all too well - Bhaal's blood-letter, Orin. To think I thought her to be speaking for the Absolute. I worshipped that woman.\nPlayer: An old flame?\nNightwarden Minthara: Jealous? You needn't be -  when Orin is in my hands, her agony will nourish me. She is the iblith who indoctrinated me with the Absolute's lies. Indeed, she is the one who indoctrinated me with the Absolute's lies.\nPlayer: What can you tell me about Orin?\nNightwarden Minthara: She is fierce, vicious, and cruel. In those respects, we are alike - but she is dangerously unpredictable. If there is a way to turn this design toward slaughter rather than control, she will take it. She is the one who brought me to Moonrise, and into the presence of her so-called god - the Absolute. Now I know that those memories are lies. There was no god. Orin held me down in a cocoon of flesh, while a mind flayer forced a parasite into my brain. And she laughed at my fear. I will find her, I will murder her. And I will smile.\nPlayer: We'll be heroes - the saviours of Baldur's Gate.\nNightwarden Minthara: Let them think that. There is a short path from saviour to ruler - a short and bloody path. I know it well, and we will walk it together. But Baldur's Gate is a mere bauble. We have the chance to seize something much greater. Surely you see it? In killing Ketheric, we fractured the cult's leadership. When we break the other Chosen and claim their Netherstones, we can take control.\nPlayer: Stealing an entire cult is a new one, even for me.\nNightwarden Minthara: In the long history of these Realms, few people have attempted anything so bold. We may fail, but we must try. The power of the enslaved elder brain could reshape the world. We could reshape the world.\nPlayer: The future you propose is shaped by violence. I'd prefer to find another way.\nNightwarden Minthara: There is violence in your future regardless. With me, you can at least be sure the violence will lead to glory. You are not stupid. When we reach Baldur's Gate and face the other Chosen, you will see that my way is the right one.\nPlayer: Maybe I'll change your mind.\nNightwarden Minthara: The elder brain is the only thing that has ever managed to change my mind. You're welcome to try. We are bound, then, to travel together, even if we do not yet agree on our ultimate purpose. There is yet one thing about you that troubles me, though. Something I need you to explain. When we killed the tieflings, at the grove, I was not in control of my actions. You do not have that excuse. So I ask you - why? Why kill them?\nPlayer: To watch them suffer - I need no other reason than that.",

Tell me, what can the Society do for you?\nPlayer: I carry an unhatched githyanki egg. Would you be interested in studying it?\nHavkelaag: A githyanki egg? What a fortuitous turn of events. I've been attempting to get my hands on one for some time now. Would you consider parting with it? The Society's coffers are deep enough to cover any expenses accrued in its retrieval, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: Chk. Don't you dare consider it.\nPlayer: What are you going to do with it?\nHavkelaag: Study it, of course. The githyanki have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months. You yourself have no doubt experienced the prejudice of those who assume that, as beings of the Underdark, we are inherently evil. The githyanki face similar prejudice, but I believe, if hatched in a less violent, more intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome its evil predispositions. I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: You're letting your personal biases affect your method. Why assume they're evil?\nHavkelaag: I assume nothing. Innate githyanki cruelty is an established fact - no doubt you witnessed it yourself in the retrieval of the egg itself. When I have a suitable sample for my study, I will, however, prove that the effects of their biological inclination are reversible. Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue. Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: What's the Ptarian code?\nHavkelaag: A series of moral imperatives bestowed by the great dragon-deity Bahamut. In my years of study, they're the closest I've found to moral perfection. Only under such rigorous 'goodness' will the subject stand a chance of being cured. My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: Your findings are irrelevant, as are the opinions of all on this kaincha plane.\nHavkelaag: Ah. A display of the well-known githyanki arrogance. I am not sure my experiment can cure that particular affliction, but give me time and I will find a way. Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg? ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: A gith hatchling is not a lab rat!

The githyanki have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months. You yourself have no doubt experienced the prejudice of those who assume that, as beings of the Underdark, we are inherently evil. The githyanki face similar prejudice, but I believe, if hatched in a less violent, more intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome its evil predispositions. I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: You're letting your personal biases affect your method. Why assume they're evil?\nHavkelaag: I assume nothing. Innate githyanki cruelty is an established fact - no doubt you witnessed it yourself in the retrieval of the egg itself. When I have a suitable sample for my study, I will, however, prove that the effects of their biological inclination are reversible. Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue. Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: So you, too, follow the teachings of Bahamut. Why him?\nHavkelaag: In my years of study, they're the closest I've found to moral perfection. Only under such rigorous 'goodness' will the subject stand a chance of being cured. My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: And what if your experiment fails?\nHavkelaag: If the child remains evil after the experiment is concluded, it will be destroyed.

I take it the breaking of my skeletons was an accident - the living are so clumsy, after all.\nPlayer: I'm pleased to be of service, Balthazar.\nBalthazar: Perhaps you can prove to me that you're more useful alive than dead. You know what's at stake here, I take it? But you're here now, and I may be able to put those limbs to work. You know what's at stake here, I take it?\nPlayer: Nere mentioned that you were seeking access to the Temple. Looks like you found it.\nBalthazar: Perhaps you'd be more useful dead than alive if you don't even know what I'm seeking here. But you're here now, and I may be able to put those limbs to work. You know what's at stake here, I take it?\nPlayer: Judging by how you're cowering in here, your survival?\nBalthazar: I do not cower - I plan. I command. I create. General Thorm trusts me. He knows I will deliver. He knows I will stand by him long after all others wilt and fall. You and all the rest have only one body with which to serve. I have as many as I care to make. You, Z'rell, all the rest... you have only one body with which to serve. I have as many as I care to make.\nPlayer: As you mention serving Ketheric, he sent you to find a relic, no?\nBalthazar: General Thorm to you. But yes, recovering the relic is the crux of it. He commands, and I, his humble servant, fulfil that command. While you, an infinitely more humble servant, fulfil my command. I will put you to work - as a scout.\nNarrator: *This necromancer has Ketheric's trust. Helping him could be just what you need to gain access to the man himself.*\nPlayer: What are the properties of this relic, magical or otherwise? So I can be of better assistance, of course. I need more to go on. Why is this relic so important? What does it do?\nBalthazar: Fine, if it'll spare me your bleating. The relic lends the General his strength, his invulnerability. It must be recovered, before his enemies attempt to exploit it. The Nightsong lends the General his strength, his invulnerability. It must be recovered, before his enemies attempt to exploit it.\nPlayer: You need my help?\nBalthazar: I do not need you, or your help. But you are here in spite of that, so I may as well make use of you. The Nightsong is close, but the way is barred and Shar's dead are... uncooperative. Clear the path for me - by blade, cunning, or whatever it takes. I will remain here until you have succeeded, or fallen.\nShadowheart: I'd trust this gasbag about as far as I can throw him - which isn't far. But perhaps better to play along, for now.\nPlayer: I'll see what I can do.",

Father - Ulder Ravengard - had just been named a Grand Duke, and was called away to Elturel to help settle a dispute. Yes - my father is a Grand Duke of Baldur's Gate, and I am his only son. That's when the Cult of the Dragon made its move.\nNarrator: *The Cult of the Dragon - a fractured religion. Some believers hold that undead dragons will inherit the world.* *Others worship your goddess, the dragon Tiamat, and intend to summon her to Faerûn.* *Others worship the dragon goddess Tiamat and intend to summon her to Faerûn.*\nPlayer: What's the Cult of the Dragon? I've never heard of them.\nWyll: A religion devoted to conjuring the most evil of goddesses, the dragon Tiamat. A tenday after father left, I heard a whisper as I slept. 'Dusthawk Hill. The Queen of Chaos awakens. Go alone.' I grabbed a rapier and set out. There wasn't a cloud in the sky, yet not a single star was shining. There they were, gathered at the foot of the Hill.\nNarrator: *Your head tingles. Wyll wants to show you what happened.*\nPlayer: Allow Wyll to share his memory with you.\nNarrator: *In the looming shadow of the mount, five groups of five figures each encircle a lofty totem.* *Atop each totem, a dragon's head is carved, and a massive orb held in its mouth. The cultists chant, first softly, then crying to the starless sky.* *There is a crack of thunder, a gust of wind - and a dragon's white head appears in the storm.* *As the maelstrom howls, Mizora's lips press to your ear. 'She will destroy Baldur's Gate. Grant me your soul - and I will give you the power to save it', she whispers.*\nWyll: She read the terms while two devils stood witness. And I said yes. One soul for one city.\nPlayer: Sacrificing your soul to save the city was a brave thing to do.",

See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy. Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace. Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver. Come. Step forward. You are no sister, but that matters none. Every student is welcome.\nPlayer: Just kill them already - all this torture is pointless.\nMalus Thorm: Behold, sisters, the very face of ignorance - one who mistakes tenderness for torture. Go on.

What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being? If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: But you: look how the succour of Shar eludes even you, one who walks faithfully in her shadow. See how painfully present you remain... We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: The sisters aren't ready. They'll make me sick instead of curing me.\nMalus Thorm: Their incisions are, as yet, still streaked with imprecision - that much I must concede. How to steady their hands, I wonder.\nPlayer: I have read your treatise. Initiate the final lesson, or die by my hand.\nMalus Thorm: The final lesson. Yes.

Of course. Tricks on top of tricks on top of tricks. But I've got only six months before I'm made a free man, thanks be to the Triad. No, scratch that. Thanks be to you.\nPlayer: Mizora said you can talk about your pact and exile. It's time I know the whole truth.\nWyll: Yes. But first, a question. If your home were under siege, what would you sacrifice to save it?\nPlayer: I'd give my life if it meant keeping the residents safe.\nWyll: As would I - and more. I was seventeen. Father - Ulder Ravengard - had just been named a Grand Duke, and was called away to Elturel to help settle a dispute. Yes - my father is a Grand Duke of Baldur's Gate, and I am his only son. That's when the Cult of the Dragon made its move.\nNarrator: *The Cult of the Dragon - a fractured religion. Some believers hold that undead dragons will inherit the world.* *Others worship the dragon goddess Tiamat and intend to summon her to Faerûn.*\nPlayer: What's the Cult of the Dragon? I've never heard of them.\nWyll: A religion devoted to conjuring the most evil of goddesses, the dragon Tiamat. A tenday after father left, I heard a whisper as I slept. 'Dusthawk Hill. The Queen of Chaos awakens. Go alone.' I grabbed a rapier and set out. There wasn't a cloud in the sky, yet not a single star was shining. There they were, gathered at the foot of the Hill.\nNarrator: *Your head tingles.

One soul for one city.\nPlayer: Is that how you lost your eye - in the battle with the Cult of the Dragon?\nWyll: It is. The one scar I ever bore of it. Mizora replaced it with a sending stone. She uses it to track my location and speak from a distance. I could flee to the Spine of the World or the depths of the Lowerdark, and still never shake her. She read the terms while two devils stood witness. And I said yes. One soul for one city.\nPlayer: Sacrificing your soul to save the city was a brave thing to do.",

I suspect he's involved with this.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: Bhaal? That's exactly what I - wait. How do you know about that?\nPlayer: Don't panic, but I'm sort of... his spawn.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: Oh! Oh my. By Ilmater's rack, that's... that's...\nPlayer: Unfortunate?\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: It's fascinating! I should arrest you at once, but - well, the Bhaalspawn crisis, it's the most interesting criminal plight in Baldurian history. If what you claim is true, you wouldn't be helping me here unless you were trying to end Bhaal's hold over you. Just like the wayward Bhaalspawn who saved the Gate before... You are here to help me, and not to sacrifice me, aren't you?\nPlayer: I'm working against Bhaal - I found the murderer's target list.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: Gods - that's it! Proof that I was right. Gods... This is it. The proof that I was right! I've been working on an assignment, see - a research project of sorts. I knew my conclusions were sound, but this... I never expected this. I'll tell you what I know. A century ago, there was a man - Sarevok Anchev. He was a child of the god of murder, Bhaal. He ruled the Iron Throne - a dark tower hiding a darker secret. It was the front for a deadly arms-dealing network. There, Sarevok amassed an army and sought to become a god. Under his stewardship, the Bhaal Temple was revived, and with it, the Bhaal cult itself. Fortunately, the Temple was destroyed, and to cleanse the city of Sarevok's memory, the Iron Throne was torn from its foundations and cast into the Chionthar. For most, that was the end of it. But cults like that don't disappear overnight. This list you brought me confirms I'm right. The Bhaal cult is back, and someone is out there, continuing Sarevok's work.\nPlayer: Not only is the cult back, it's spreading fast. I ran into some Bhaalists in the park.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: No doubt you found a trail of bodies in their wake? The brutality of the killings is on a par with Sarevok's own. But there's something more here, something new... There's a reverence to these murders, a certain flair. It's as if they were done in worship. The precision of the cuts, the depth, the execution - the best butchers in Faerûn couldn't make a cut like that. Trust me, I've asked them. I've done everything I can within the remit of my job. Any more, and they'll fire me. But you - you're not bound by such constraints. Help me out, here. Help the city out. Follow the trail of these murders. Prove the truth. Use your lineage to get places the Fist can't. I'll bet if you follow the trail of these murders, you'll be able to unearth the truth of this resurgence.\nPlayer: What about the other victims on the list, the ones who are still alive?\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: There are patriars on the murder target list. I'm oathbound to secure them first, so I'll be heading to the Upper City next. While I'm there, the other potential victims will be at risk. Could you warn them?\nPlayer: The Flaming Fist should be protecting everyone - not just Upper City folk.",

If your home were under siege, what would you sacrifice to save it?\nPlayer: I'd give my life if it meant keeping the residents safe.\nWyll: As would I - and more. I was seventeen. Father - Ulder Ravengard - had just been named a Grand Duke, and was called away to Elturel to help settle a dispute. Yes - my father is a Grand Duke of Baldur's Gate, and I am his only son. That's when the Cult of the Dragon made its move.\nNarrator: *Others worship the dragon goddess Tiamat and intend to summon her to Faerûn.*\nPlayer: The Cult of the Dragon had infiltrated Baldur's Gate? To what end?\nWyll: To conjure the Dragon Queen and lay waste to Baldur's Gate. A tenday after father left, I heard a whisper as I slept. 'Dusthawk Hill. The Queen of Chaos awakens. Go alone.' I grabbed a rapier and set out. There wasn't a cloud in the sky, yet not a single star was shining. There they were, gathered at the foot of the Hill.\nNarrator: *Your head tingles. Wyll wants to show you what happened.*\nPlayer: Allow Wyll to share his memory with you.\nNarrator: *In the looming shadow of the mount, five groups of five figures each encircle a lofty totem.* *Atop each totem, a dragon's head is carved, and a massive orb held in its mouth. The cultists chant, first softly, then crying to the starless sky.* *There is a crack of thunder, a gust of wind - and a dragon's white head appears in the storm.* *As the maelstrom howls, Mizora's lips press to your ear. 'She will destroy Baldur's Gate. Grant me your soul - and I will give you the power to save it', she whispers.*\nWyll: She read the terms while two devils stood witness. And I said yes.

There's a reverence to these murders, a certain flair. It's as if they were done in worship. The precision of the cuts, the depth, the execution - the best butchers in Faerûn couldn't make a cut like that. Trust me, I've asked them. I've done everything I can within the remit of my job.

You know what's at stake here, I take it?\nPlayer: Z'rell spoke of a relic - something called the Nightsong in your notes. They were very interesting. Yet you seem no closer to retrieving the Nightsong? I read your notes - very interesting.\nBalthazar: Interesting, and private. Give me one reason why I shouldn't have my creations kill you right now, thief.\nPlayer: Sir, I am a jack-of-all-trades and a master of many. Our meeting was not by chance - you need me.

The Nightsong lends the General his strength, his invulnerability. It must be recovered, before his enemies attempt to exploit it.\nPlayer: Sounds like you've good reason to be proud of the Nightsong - tell me more.\nBalthazar: And spoil the surprise? I think not. But let's just say that the Nightsong was a unique specimen even before I began my work... Words - even my words - are woefully insufficient. When you see for yourself, you will understand.\nPlayer: What do you need me to do?\nBalthazar: I do not need you, or your help. But you are here in spite of that, so I may as well make use of you. The Nightsong is close, but the way is barred and Shar's dead are... uncooperative. Clear the path for me - by blade, cunning, or whatever it takes. I will remain here until you have succeeded, or fallen.\nShadowheart: I'd trust this gasbag about as far as I can throw him - which isn't far. But perhaps better to play along, for now.\nPlayer: You have resources to spare - give me something to aid my search.\nBalthazar: Fine. I will assign Flesh to aid you on your way. Ring this bell... ...Hmm. Misplaced, it seems. You will be capable enough without it.\nPlayer: This sounds like your problem, not mine. Keep it - this is your problem, not mine.\nBalthazar: This is not a problem - it is an opportunity. And it is not a choice either - you will obey.\nPlayer: Attack.",

I take it the breaking of my skeletons was an accident - the living are so clumsy, after all.\nPlayer: I'm pleased to be of service, Balthazar.\nBalthazar: Perhaps you can prove to me that you're more useful alive than dead. You know what's at stake here, I take it? But you're here now, and I may be able to put those limbs to work. You know what's at stake here, I take it?\nPlayer: Enlighten me. Fine, consider your merits acknowledged. Care to enlighten me as to what's going on?\nBalthazar: There is a relic here. One which General Thorm desires. No - needs. I will retrieve it for him... ...and you will help me. Ignorant you may be, you've shown some prowess in scouting and combat by making it this far. While you, an infinitely more humble servant, fulfil my command. I will put you to work - as a scout.\nNarrator: *This necromancer has Ketheric's trust. Helping him could be just what you need to gain access to the man himself.*\nPlayer: Jobs like this always go smoother when I know exactly what I'm looking for. I need more to go on. Why is this relic so important? What does it do?\nBalthazar: Telling you will not make the task any less perilous. Just obey, and use your ignorance as a shield. You should be adept at that already. The Nightsong lends the General his strength, his invulnerability. It must be recovered, before his enemies attempt to exploit it.\nPlayer: You need my help?\nBalthazar: I do not need you, or your help. But you are here in spite of that, so I may as well make use of you. The relic is close, but the way is barred and Shar's dead are... uncooperative. Clear the path for me - by blade, cunning, or whatever it takes. I will remain here until you have succeeded, or fallen.\nShadowheart: I'd trust this gasbag about as far as I can throw him - which isn't far. But perhaps better to play along, for now.\nPlayer: You have resources to spare - give me something to aid my search.\nBalthazar: Fine. I will assign Flesh to aid you on your way. Ring this bell... ...and he will come. My brother is no intellectual powerhouse, but he is strong, loyal and punctual. Should a fight turn against you, remember the bell.\nPlayer: Actually, I have your mother.\nBalthazar: What the...? Give me back my mother, this instant!\nPlayer: Return Balthazar's mother.\nBalthazar: Good. And keep your hands to yourself in future.\nNodeContext: Cooling down (player has returned the jar containing his dead mother)\nBalthazar: My brother is no intellectual powerhouse, but he is strong, loyal and punctual. Should a fight turn against you, remember the bell.\nPlayer: Keep it - this is your problem, not mine.\nBalthazar: This is not a problem - it is an opportunity.

You are here to help me, and not to sacrifice me, aren't you?\nPlayer: You're very excited about Bhaal for someone who's supposed to be protecting the city.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: It's my job to be. Though I confess it has been very interesting. You see, these murders have been cropping up all over the city. I've been following their trail for a while now, and tracing it back to its roots. The ritualistic brutality of them... it's extraordinary. And it could only be the work of a Bhaalist. But you've been investigating too, if I'm not mistaken? You're trying to stop your own kind?

Say nothing of your intentions.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: I'm glad you're on the right side of this, Bhaalspawn. You could be invaluable, if you can get on the inside. Hells, you might be the only one who can stop this. What else do you know?\nPlayer: I'm planning to infiltrate the cult, but I don't know where to start.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: Most of what I know is based on reading into Sarevok's history. I'm sure it's nothing next to your personal experience, but I'll share what I have. A century ago, Bhaal bred dozens just like you. One of whom was Sarevok Anchev. For most, that was the end of it. But cults like that don't disappear overnight. That list you spoke of confirms I'm right. The Bhaal cult is back, and someone is out there, continuing Sarevok's work.\nPlayer: What makes you think it's not Sarevok himself?\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: I've not ruled out the possibility that it is Sarevok himself. The brutality of the killings is certainly reminiscent of his work. But there's something more here, something new... There's a reverence to these murders, a certain flair. It's as if they were done in worship. The precision of the cuts, the depth, the execution - the best butchers in Faerûn couldn't make a cut like that. Trust me, I've asked them. I've done everything I can within the remit of my job. Any more, and they'll fire me. But you - you're not bound by such constraints. Help me out, here. Help the city out. I'll bet if you follow the trail of these murders, you'll be able to unearth the truth of this resurgence.\nPlayer: I'm trying to hide from my Father's wrath. I fear what will happen if I delve too deeply.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: Then I hope you can at least protect yourself, and pray this plot fails. But before you run and hide, there are a few more lives you could easily save. There are patriars on the murder target list.

I should arrest you at once, but - well, the Bhaalspawn crisis, it's the most interesting criminal plight in Baldurian history.

You are here to help me, and not to sacrifice me, aren't you?\nPlayer: I am working against Bhaal - I got a hold of the list of murder targets.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: I'm glad you're on the right side of this, Bhaalspawn. You could be invaluable, if you can get on the inside. Hells, you might be the only one who can stop this. What else do you know?\nPlayer: I'm planning to infiltrate the cult, but I don't know where to start.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: Most of what I know is based on reading into Sarevok's history. I'm sure it's nothing next to your personal experience, but I'll share what I have. A century ago, Bhaal bred dozens just like you. One of whom was Sarevok Anchev. The Bhaal cult is back, and someone is out there, continuing Sarevok's work.\nPlayer: You're not wrong about the cult. I found some Bhaalists in the sewers.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: No doubt you found a trail of bodies in their wake? The brutality of the killings is on a par with Sarevok's own. But there's something more here, something new... There's a reverence to these murders, a certain flair. It's as if they were done in worship. The precision of the cuts, the depth, the execution - the best butchers in Faerûn couldn't make a cut like that. Trust me, I've asked them. I've done everything I can within the remit of my job. Any more, and they'll fire me. But you - you're not bound by such constraints. Help me out, here. Help the city out. Follow the trail of these murders. Prove the truth. Use your lineage to get places the Fist can't. I'll bet if you follow the trail of these murders, you'll be able to unearth the truth of this resurgence.\nPlayer: What about the other victims on the list, the ones who are still alive?\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: There are patriars on the murder target list. I'm oathbound to secure them first, so I'll be heading to the Upper City next. While I'm there, the other potential victims will be at risk.

Tricks on top of tricks on top of tricks. Godsdamnit, I'll never be rid of her. The more I want to shake her leash, the tighter she pulls it.\nPlayer: Mizora said you can talk about your pact and exile. It's time I know the whole truth.\nWyll: Yes. But first, a question. If your home were under siege, what would you sacrifice to save it?\nPlayer: I wouldn't give up my soul, if that's what you're getting at.\nWyll: It is. And I did. I was seventeen. Father - Ulder Ravengard - had just been named a Grand Duke, and was called away to Elturel to help settle a dispute. Yes - my father is a Grand Duke of Baldur's Gate, and I am his only son. That's when the Cult of the Dragon made its move.\nNarrator: *The Cult of the Dragon - a fractured religion. Some believers hold that undead dragons will inherit the world.* *Others worship the dragon goddess Tiamat and intend to summon her to Faerûn.*\nPlayer: Nod and let Wyll continue his story.\nWyll: A tenday after father left, I heard a whisper as I slept. 'Dusthawk Hill. The Queen of Chaos awakens. Go alone.' I grabbed a rapier and set out. There wasn't a cloud in the sky, yet not a single star was shining. There they were, gathered at the foot of the Hill.\nNarrator: *Your head tingles. Wyll wants to show you what happened.*\nPlayer: Allow Wyll to share his memory with you.\nNarrator: *In the looming shadow of the mount, five groups of five figures each encircle a lofty totem.* *Atop each totem, a dragon's head is carved, and a massive orb held in its mouth. The cultists chant, first softly, then crying to the starless sky.* *There is a crack of thunder, a gust of wind - and a dragon's white head appears in the storm.* *As the maelstrom howls, Mizora's lips press to your ear. 'She will destroy Baldur's Gate. Grant me your soul - and I will give you the power to save it', she whispers.*\nWyll: She read the terms while two devils stood witness. And I said yes. One soul for one city.\nPlayer: Is that how you lost your eye - in the battle with the Cult of the Dragon?\nWyll: It is. The one scar I ever bore of it. You were right, of course - the new eye is a sending stone, courtesy of Mizora. She uses it to track my location and call from a distance. I could flee to the Spine of the World or the depths of the Lowerdark, and still never shake her. She read the terms while two devils stood witness. And I said yes. One soul for one city.\nPlayer: Sacrificing your soul to save the city was a brave thing to do.",

Proof that I was right. Gods... This is it. The proof that I was right! I've been working on an assignment, see - a research project of sorts. I knew my conclusions were sound, but this... I never expected this. I'll tell you what I know. A century ago, there was a man - Sarevok Anchev. He was a child of the god of murder, Bhaal. He ruled the Iron Throne - a dark tower hiding a darker secret. It was the front for a deadly arms-dealing network. There, Sarevok amassed an army and sought to become a god. Under his stewardship, the Bhaal Temple was revived, and with it, the Bhaal cult itself. Fortunately, the Temple was destroyed, and to cleanse the city of Sarevok's memory, the Iron Throne was torn from its foundations and cast into the Chionthar. For most, that was the end of it. But cults like that don't disappear overnight. This list you brought me confirms I'm right. The Bhaal cult is back, and someone is out there, continuing Sarevok's work.\nPlayer: I think it may be another Bhaalspawn...\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: Gods save us all if you're right, but I'd believe it. Whoever it is, they are intimately familiar with Sarevok's work. The brutality of the killings is on a par with Sarevok's own. But there's something more here, something new... There's a reverence to these murders, a certain flair. It's as if they were done in worship. The precision of the cuts, the depth, the execution - the best butchers in Faerûn couldn't make a cut like that. Trust me, I've asked them. I tried to explain all this to my superiors, but they wouldn't have any of it. They told me to drop it. Told me the city doesn't need another conspiracy theorist and to get back to doing my job before they find someone else to do it for me. But you - you're not bound by such constraints. Help me out, here. Help the city out. Follow the trail of these murders. Prove the truth. Use your lineage to get places the Fist can't. I'll bet if you follow the trail of these murders, you'll be able to unearth the truth of this resurgence.\nPlayer: I'm trying to hide from my Father's wrath. I fear what will happen if I delve too deeply.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: Then I hope you can at least protect yourself, and pray this plot fails. But before you run and hide, there are a few more lives you could easily save. There are patriars on the murder target list. I'm oathbound to secure them first, so I'll be heading to the Upper City next. While I'm there, the other potential victims will be at risk. Could you warn them?\nPlayer: The Flaming Fist should be protecting everyone - not just Upper City folk.",

I'm surprised you dare show your face after Mystra cast you on the scrap heap. Well don't stand on ceremony - out with it.\nPlayer: I seek a certain rare tome - concerning Karsus.\nLorroakan: You're quite in luck, then - see Tolna downstairs.

Then you'll have no trouble fulfilling the contract to bring the Nightsong here.\nPlayer: Why do you want her so badly?\nLorroakan: I'm growing tired of this repartee, my friend. Let us cut to the chase. Beautiful, isn't it? Worth more than your life, too. I bought it from a Calishite warlock with very little of his soul left to him. It can bind a celestial to the wearer's service with a snap of the fingers. And this? This can keep her in place. Forever.\nPlayer: I'll tell her to come here - just to give her the satisfaction of ripping you to shreds. I'll tell her to come here - just to give her the satisfaction of ripping you to shreds.",

Tricks on top of tricks on top of tricks. But I've got only six months before I'm made a free man, thanks be to the Triad. No, scratch that. Thanks be to you.\nPlayer: Mizora said you can talk about your pact and exile. It's time I know the whole truth.\nWyll: Yes. But first, a question. If your home were under siege, what would you sacrifice to save it?\nPlayer: The place could burn to cinder for all I care.\nWyll: I could never be so disloyal to Baldur's Gate. I was seventeen. Father - Ulder Ravengard - had just been named a Grand Duke, and was called away to Elturel to help settle a dispute. Yes - my father is a Grand Duke of Baldur's Gate, and I am his only son. That's when the Cult of the Dragon made its move.\nNarrator: *The Cult of the Dragon - a fractured religion. Some believers hold that undead dragons will inherit the world.* *Others worship the dragon goddess Tiamat and intend to summon her to Faerûn.*\nPlayer: What's the Cult of the Dragon? I've never heard of them.\nWyll: A religion devoted to conjuring the most evil of goddesses, the dragon Tiamat. A tenday after father left, I heard a whisper as I slept. 'Dusthawk Hill. The Queen of Chaos awakens. Go alone.' I grabbed a rapier and set out. There wasn't a cloud in the sky, yet not a single star was shining. There they were, gathered at the foot of the Hill.\nNarrator: *Your head tingles. Wyll wants to show you what happened.*\nPlayer: Allow Wyll to share his memory with you.\nNarrator: *In the looming shadow of the mount, five groups of five figures each encircle a lofty totem.* *Atop each totem, a dragon's head is carved, and a massive orb held in its mouth. The cultists chant, first softly, then crying to the starless sky.* *There is a crack of thunder, a gust of wind - and a dragon's white head appears in the storm, the first of Tiamat's five heads.* *As the maelstrom howls, Mizora's lips press to your ear. 'She will destroy Baldur's Gate. Grant me your soul - and I will give you the power to save it', she whispers.*\nWyll: She read the terms while two devils stood witness. And I said yes. One soul for one city.\nPlayer: It was brave, what you did for the city.\nWyll: She read the terms while two devils stood witness. And I said yes. One soul for one city.\nPlayer: And what about your father the Grand Duke?\nWyll: He returned to an unsuspecting city and a wayward son with a smirking devil at his side. I tried to tell him the truth, but my mouth couldn't form the words. I led him to the battlefield, but Mizora had swept it clean. I showed him my stone eye - but he only turned away. After, he said only one word: 'Go.' So I did. She read the terms while two devils stood witness. And I said yes. One soul for one city.\nPlayer: It was brave, what you did for the city.",

I never expected this. I'll tell you what I know. A century ago, there was a man - Sarevok Anchev. He was a child of the god of murder, Bhaal. He ruled the Iron Throne - a dark tower hiding a darker secret. It was the front for a deadly arms-dealing network. There, Sarevok amassed an army and sought to become a god. Under his stewardship, the Bhaal Temple was revived, and with it, the Bhaal cult itself. Fortunately, the Temple was destroyed, and to cleanse the city of Sarevok's memory, the Iron Throne was torn from its foundations and cast into the Chionthar. For most, that was the end of it.

    "conversation": "Havkelaag: Ah, a surface dweller. You find yourself in the cradle of all knowledge relating to the Underdark: the Society of Brilliance. Tell me, what can the Society do for you?\nPlayer: I met an expeditioner claiming to work for you. She sought a githyanki egg.\nHavkelaag: Yes, dear Lady Esther. One of our most reliable contractors, though unfortunately this particular request was too much even for her. I believe she quite lost her senses over the task. She came here insisting I purchase an owlbear egg from her, of all things. I don't suppose you've stumbled across any githyanki eggs during your travels? The Society will compensate you for any we purchase, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54]) Would you consider parting with it? The Society's coffers are deep enough to cover any expenses accrued in its retrieval, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: Chk. Don't you dare consider it.\nPlayer: What are you going to do with it?\nHavkelaag: Study it, of course. The githyanki have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months. You yourself have no doubt experienced the prejudice of those who assume that, as beings of the Underdark, we are inherently evil. The githyanki face similar prejudice, but I believe, if hatched in a less violent, more intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome its evil predispositions. I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: You're letting your personal biases affect your method. Why assume they're evil?\nHavkelaag: I assume nothing. Innate githyanki cruelty is an established fact - no doubt you witnessed it yourself in the retrieval of the egg itself. When I have a suitable sample for my study, I will, however, prove that the effects of their biological inclination are reversible. Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue. Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: That kind of indoctrination and time-forced nurture violates the natural order. It invalidates the whole experiment.\nHavkelaag: I won't bother to argue with you. An arboreal shaman can't be expected to understand the rigorous protocols of theoretical research. My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: No benefit could justify you inflicting such cruelty.\nHavkelaag: Rigorous experimental methods demand we do not indulge our own emotional responses in the application of discomfort to our subjects. Only by the full, uninhibited application of psionic stimuli will we have a true measure of whether the child's innate evil has been cured. Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg? ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: A gith hatchling is not a lab rat! This shka'keth should be bled dry for the mere suggestion.\nPlayer: This experiment is barbaric. You're never getting the egg.",

We tracked them to this ancient village only to be faced with a man we killed and buried over a century ago.\nPlayer: Ketheric Thorm. He and I have history.\nJaheira: You were the one who rescued those the Absolute had imprisoned. You were courageous to brave the depths of Ketheric's stronghold. I suppose you know about Ketheric, then. His invincibility. That we'll never cleanse this place until he's made to bleed. We met him on the road here - commanding an army of the Absolute, intent on destroying Baldur's Gate. I put an arrow through his eye myself, only to watch him pluck it out like a splinter. He healed right in front of me, and chased us into the shadows. Things looked hopeless, but experience has taught me that no matter how bleak things look, there's always hope. You are that hope.\nPlayer: I'm trying my best to be...\nJaheira: Protected by your artefact, you can infiltrate his forces at Moonrise Towers, posing as a True Soul. Find out what it is that makes him invincible so we can strip him of his advantage. Once Ketheric is without his shield, the sword: together we assault his tower, and put a final end to this blight.\nPlayer: There's something you should know - Marcus, the Flaming Fist upstairs, is a True Soul. He wants to kidnap Isobel.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Jaheir takes the glass from the table.\nJaheira: This place is crawling with Harpers. If Marcus managed to get himself infected, we would've known the same minute. Is this some kind of test? Or a game, perhaps?\nPlayer: Ignore me, then. It's your own funeral.\nJaheira: I'm not ignoring you - I just see no evidence of your rather outlandish claim. You've come from the shadows and wasted no time accusing one of our companions of treason. It's all a little... odd. A Harper's gaze can only be turned by proof. By the looks of it, a tall tale is all you have to offer. But you're far from the most eccentric drinking companion I've had. I'd like to know more. Cheers. To your very good health.\nPlayer: Smell the wine.\nNarrator: *You perceive a faint hint of Klauthgrass, a herb that is said to elicit the truth. Jaheira smiles at you knowingly.*\nJaheira: It doesn't spoil the taste, if that's what you're wondering.\nPlayer: I was actually wondering if it would affect me.

Yes, I'm Devella, the unfortunate colleague. Unless you've got useful information, leave me to my work. Duke Stelmane's dead - and I've got to find who killed her.\nPlayer: I know more about Bhaal than anyone you'll find. You don't want to send me away.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: Bhaal?

Proof that I was right. Gods... This is it. The proof that I was right! I've been working on an assignment, see - a research project of sorts. I knew my conclusions were sound, but this... I never expected this. I'll tell you what I know. A century ago, there was a man - Sarevok Anchev. He was a child of the god of murder, Bhaal. He ruled the Iron Throne - a dark tower hiding a darker secret. It was the front for a deadly arms-dealing network. There, Sarevok amassed an army and sought to become a god. Under his stewardship, the Bhaal Temple was revived, and with it, the Bhaal cult itself. Fortunately, the Temple was destroyed, and to cleanse the city of Sarevok's memory, the Iron Throne was torn from its foundations and cast into the Chionthar. For most, that was the end of it. But cults like that don't disappear overnight. That list you spoke of confirms I'm right. The Bhaal cult is back, and someone is out there, continuing Sarevok's work.\nPlayer: Not only is the cult back, it's spreading fast. I ran into some Bhaalists in the park.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: No doubt you found a trail of bodies in their wake? The brutality of the killings is on a par with Sarevok's own. But there's something more here, something new... There's a reverence to these murders, a certain flair. It's as if they were done in worship. The precision of the cuts, the depth, the execution - the best butchers in Faerûn couldn't make a cut like that. Trust me, I've asked them. I tried to explain all this to my superiors, but they wouldn't have any of it. They told me to drop it. Told me the city doesn't need another conspiracy theorist and to get back to doing my job before they find someone else to do it for me. But you - you're not bound by such constraints. Help me out, here. Help the city out. I'll bet if you follow the trail of these murders, you'll be able to unearth the truth of this resurgence.\nPlayer: I've got better things to do than investigate a cult.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: I suppose it was quite an ask... but perhaps you wouldn't mind doing me a different, smaller favour? There are patriars on the murder target list. I'm oathbound to secure them first, so I'll be heading to the Upper City next. While I'm there, the other potential victims will be at risk. Could you warn them?\nPlayer: I'll see what I can do.",

See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy. Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself.

A century ago, Bhaal bred dozens just like you. One of whom was Sarevok Anchev. The Bhaal cult is back, and someone is out there, continuing Sarevok's work.\nPlayer: You should raise this with your superiors, immediately.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: Don't you think I've tried? They won't listen. You're lucky you met me - most of the Fist wouldn't have believed you were a Bhaalspawn. Think it's Baldurian superstition. They told me to drop it. Told me the city doesn't need another conspiracy theorist and to get back to doing my job before they find someone else to do it for me. But you - you're not bound by such constraints. Help me out, here. Help the city out. I'll bet if you follow the trail of these murders, you'll be able to unearth the truth of this resurgence.\nPlayer: I'll do my best.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: You really are a godsend. But - one more thing... There are patriars on the murder target list. I'm oathbound to secure them first, so I'll be heading to the Upper City next. While I'm there, the other potential victims will be at risk. Could you warn them?\nPlayer: The Flaming Fist should be protecting everyone - not just Upper City folk.",

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon’s voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar. See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy. Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace. Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver. Come. Step forward. You are no sister, but that matters none. Every student is welcome.\nPlayer: A student, yes. Do please enlighten me.\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly. It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nWyll: Hells. Only a monster would inflict misery and call it medicine.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being? If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: But you: look how the succour of Shar eludes even you, one who walks faithfully in her shadow. See how painfully present you remain... We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: The goddess has greater plans for me than to submit to your scalpels.\nMalus Thorm: Another absence is your fate? But if you are not here to be cured, how will my sisters learn? Their incisions are, as yet, still streaked with imprecision - that much I must concede. How to steady their hands, I wonder.\nPlayer: Sparring is vital to progress. Have them practice on each other. Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\nMalus Thorm: Yes... For are we not all in need of a cure? The scalpel does not discriminate. Let each and every one of you partake in its soothing journey. Absence, sisters. Acquaint yourselves.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) Screaming and slashing, the sisters brutally murder each other.\nMalus Thorm: It is a proud moment when one sees one's teachings so lovingly taken to heart. You are to be commended for their graduation - rewarded with the promised cure. Come, I will acquaint you with the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nPlayer: I would rather acquaint myself - if you show me how.\nMalus Thorm: Your diligence is exemplary. Very well: your own scalpel you will be. Observe - then succeed me, into the succour of Shar.",

The brutality of the killings is on a par with Sarevok's own. But there's something more here, something new... There's a reverence to these murders, a certain flair. It's as if they were done in worship. The precision of the cuts, the depth, the execution - the best butchers in Faerûn couldn't make a cut like that. Trust me, I've asked them.

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon’s voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar. See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy. Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace. Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver. Come. Step forward. You are no sister, but that matters none. Every student is welcome.\nPlayer: I am no student, I seek knowledge of the curse. It is a blight on this land.\nMalus Thorm: A curse? Nay, a cure that leads to the very pinnacle of being:\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly. It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nGale: Gods, what living nightmare is this?\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being? If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: But you: look how the succour of Shar eludes you. See how painfully present you remain... We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: The sisters aren't ready. They'll make me sick instead of curing me.\nMalus Thorm: Their incisions are, as yet, still streaked with imprecision - that much I must concede. How to steady their hands, I wonder.\nPlayer: Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\nMalus Thorm: Yes... For are we not all in need of a cure? The scalpel does not discriminate. Let each and every one of you partake in its soothing journey. Absence, sisters. Acquaint yourselves.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) Screaming and slashing, the sisters brutally murder each other.\nMalus Thorm: It is a proud moment when one sees one's teachings so lovingly taken to heart. You are to be commended for their graduation - rewarded with the promised cure. Come, I will acquaint you with the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nPlayer: My magic has blinded me - I see now that Shar is the only path. Show me how - I beg of you. I would rather acquaint myself - if you show me how.\nMalus Thorm: Your diligence is exemplary. Very well: your own scalpel you will be. Observe - then succeed me, into the succour of Shar.",

Proof that I was right. Gods... This is it. The proof that I was right! I've been working on an assignment, see - a research project of sorts. I knew my conclusions were sound, but this... I never expected this. I'll tell you what I know. A century ago, there was a man - Sarevok Anchev. He was a child of the god of murder, Bhaal. He ruled the Iron Throne - a dark tower hiding a darker secret. It was the front for a deadly arms-dealing network. There, Sarevok amassed an army and sought to become a god. Under his stewardship, the Bhaal Temple was revived, and with it, the Bhaal cult itself. Fortunately, the Temple was destroyed, and to cleanse the city of Sarevok's memory, the Iron Throne was torn from its foundations and cast into the Chionthar. For most, that was the end of it. But cults like that don't disappear overnight. That list you spoke of confirms I'm right. The Bhaal cult is back, and someone is out there, continuing Sarevok's work.\nPlayer: You should raise this with your superiors, immediately.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: Don't you think I've tried? They won't listen. You're lucky you met me - most of the Fist wouldn't have believed you were a Bhaalspawn. Think it's Baldurian superstition. They told me to drop it. Told me the city doesn't need another conspiracy theorist and to get back to doing my job before they find someone else to do it for me. But you - you're not bound by such constraints. Help me out, here. Help the city out. Follow the trail of these murders. Prove the truth. Use your lineage to get places the Fist can't. I'll bet if you follow the trail of these murders, you'll be able to unearth the truth of this resurgence.\nPlayer: I've got better things to do than investigate a cult.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: I suppose it was quite an ask... but perhaps you wouldn't mind doing me a different, smaller favour? There are patriars on the murder target list. I'm oathbound to secure them first, so I'll be heading to the Upper City next. While I'm there, the other potential victims will be at risk.

For your sake, the last one better be bloody good.\nPlayer: Are you Devella? Valeria sent me.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: To fetch her another bottle of mead, no doubt. Yes, I'm Devella, the unfortunate colleague. Unless you've got useful information, leave me to my work. Duke Stelmane's dead - and I've got to find who killed her.\nPlayer: I know more about Bhaal than anyone you'll find. You don't want to send me away.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: Bhaal? That's exactly what I - wait. How do you know about that?\nPlayer: Don't panic, but I'm sort of... his spawn.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: Oh! Oh my. By Ilmater's rack, that's... that's...\nPlayer: Unfortunate?\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: It's fascinating! I should arrest you at once, but - well, the Bhaalspawn crisis, it's the most interesting criminal plight in Baldurian history. If what you claim is true, you wouldn't be helping me here unless you were trying to end Bhaal's hold over you. Just like the wayward Bhaalspawn who saved the Gate before... You are here to help me, and not to sacrifice me, aren't you?\nPlayer: I'm working against Bhaal - I found the murderer's target list.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: Gods - that's it! Proof that I was right. Gods... This is it. The proof that I was right! I've been working on an assignment, see - a research project of sorts. I knew my conclusions were sound, but this... I never expected this. I'll tell you what I know. A century ago, there was a man - Sarevok Anchev. He was a child of the god of murder, Bhaal. He ruled the Iron Throne - a dark tower hiding a darker secret. It was the front for a deadly arms-dealing network. There, Sarevok amassed an army and sought to become a god. Under his stewardship, the Bhaal Temple was revived, and with it, the Bhaal cult itself. Fortunately, the Temple was destroyed, and to cleanse the city of Sarevok's memory, the Iron Throne was torn from its foundations and cast into the Chionthar. For most, that was the end of it. But cults like that don't disappear overnight. That list you spoke of confirms I'm right. The Bhaal cult is back, and someone is out there, continuing Sarevok's work.\nPlayer: You're absolutely right. I have reasons of my own to think there's been an increase in Bhaalist activity.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: Good. Then your eyes are open to the truth. The brutality of the killings is on a par with Sarevok's own. But there's something more here, something new... There's a reverence to these murders, a certain flair. It's as if they were done in worship. The precision of the cuts, the depth, the execution - the best butchers in Faerûn couldn't make a cut like that. Trust me, I've asked them. I've done everything I can within the remit of my job. Any more, and they'll fire me. But you - you're not bound by such constraints. Help me out, here. Help the city out. I'll bet if you follow the trail of these murders, you'll be able to unearth the truth of this resurgence.\nPlayer: What about the other victims on the list, the ones who are still alive?\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: There are patriars on the murder target list. I'm oathbound to secure them first, so I'll be heading to the Upper City next. While I'm there, the other potential victims will be at risk. Could you warn them?\nPlayer: The Flaming Fist should be protecting everyone - not just Upper City folk.",

If your home were under siege, what would you sacrifice to save it?\nPlayer: I'd give my life if it meant keeping the residents safe.\nWyll: As would I - and more. I was seventeen. Father - Ulder Ravengard - had just been named a Grand Duke, and was called away to Elturel to help settle a dispute. Yes - my father is a Grand Duke of Baldur's Gate, and I am his only son. That's when the Cult of the Dragon made its move.\nNarrator: *The Cult of the Dragon - a fractured religion. Some believers hold that undead dragons will inherit the world.* *Others worship the dragon goddess Tiamat and intend to summon her to Faerûn.*\nPlayer: Nod and let Wyll continue his story.\nWyll: A tenday after father left, I heard a whisper as I slept. 'Dusthawk Hill. The Queen of Chaos awakens. Go alone.' I grabbed a rapier and set out. There wasn't a cloud in the sky, yet not a single star was shining. There they were, gathered at the foot of the Hill.\nNarrator: *Your head tingles. Wyll wants to show you what happened.*\nPlayer: Allow Wyll to share his memory with you.\nNarrator: *In the looming shadow of the mount, five groups of five figures each encircle a lofty totem.* *Atop each totem, a dragon's head is carved, and a massive orb held in its mouth. The cultists chant, first softly, then crying to the starless sky.* *There is a crack of thunder, a gust of wind - and a dragon's white head appears in the storm.* *As the maelstrom howls, Mizora's lips press to your ear. 'She will destroy Baldur's Gate. Grant me your soul - and I will give you the power to save it', she whispers.*\nWyll: She read the terms while two devils stood witness. And I said yes. One soul for one city.\nPlayer: Is that how you lost your eye - in the battle with the Cult of the Dragon?\nWyll: It is. The one scar I ever bore of it. You were right, of course - the new eye is a sending stone, courtesy of Mizora. She uses it to track my location and call from a distance. I could flee to the Spine of the World or the depths of the Lowerdark, and still never shake her. She read the terms while two devils stood witness. And I said yes. One soul for one city.\nPlayer: A brave choice. And a frightening one.\nWyll: I don't know that it was brave. I just know that it was right. The moment I agreed, I burned with the fires of Avernus and oozed the rot of Dis. The cultists choked on our poisons and burned from our flames. When we were done, all that remained were five greyed orbs atop a pile of ash. My soul was bound and my lips were sealed. She read the terms while two devils stood witness. And I said yes. One soul for one city.\nPlayer: A brave choice. And a frightening one.",

As will a thousand other perils. They aren't ready to get on the road on their own.\nPlayer: So? If they die, they die. That's life for you.\nWyll: We all die. But life's still worth the living. Otherwise, what's the point of it? But off with you. This is your day! Have a dance. Enjoy the music.\nPlayer: Can't you tell why I really followed you out here?\nWyll: Clearly Mol has put you up to stealing my britches so you can turn them into a flag for her gang. Not that I'd necessarily object. Too much honey-wine can do that. You should watch yourself.\nPlayer: Nope. Guess again.\nWyll: Let me think... Why are you really here? You're running away from Gale's cooking. It's delicious, don't get me wrong, but that man wouldn't eat a vegetable unless Mystra herself commanded it. Why else? There couldn't be another reason.\nPlayer: Because I like you. And I want to know you better.\nWyll: Then we share a similar affliction. For I've grown fond of you too. Though I can't say I've earned the honour. I haven't even managed to kill one measly devil. I'm hardly a prime catch. The world spits on those partial to devils. I'm hardly a prime catch.\nPlayer: Maybe a kiss would prove my affections.\nWyll: *Sigh.* You drive a hard bargain.

By Ilmater's rack, that's... that's...\nPlayer: Abhorrent?\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: It's fascinating! I should arrest you at once, but - well, the Bhaalspawn crisis, it's the most interesting criminal plight in Baldurian history. If what you claim is true, you wouldn't be helping me here unless you were trying to end Bhaal's hold over you. Just like the wayward Bhaalspawn who saved the Gate before... You are here to help me, and not to sacrifice me, aren't you?\nPlayer: Tell her of the target list. Say nothing of your intentions.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: Gods - that's it! Proof that I was right. Gods... This is it. The proof that I was right! I've been working on an assignment, see - a research project of sorts. I knew my conclusions were sound, but this... I never expected this. I'll tell you what I know. A century ago, there was a man - Sarevok Anchev. He was a child of the god of murder, Bhaal. He ruled the Iron Throne - a dark tower hiding a darker secret. It was the front for a deadly arms-dealing network. There, Sarevok amassed an army and sought to become a god. Under his stewardship, the Bhaal Temple was revived, and with it, the Bhaal cult itself. Fortunately, the Temple was destroyed, and to cleanse the city of Sarevok's memory, the Iron Throne was torn from its foundations and cast into the Chionthar. For most, that was the end of it. But cults like that don't disappear overnight. That list you spoke of confirms I'm right. The Bhaal cult is back, and someone is out there, continuing Sarevok's work.\nPlayer: Not only is the cult back, it's spreading fast. I ran into some Bhaalists in the park.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: No doubt you found a trail of bodies in their wake? The brutality of the killings is on a par with Sarevok's own. But there's something more here, something new... There's a reverence to these murders, a certain flair. It's as if they were done in worship. The precision of the cuts, the depth, the execution - the best butchers in Faerûn couldn't make a cut like that. Trust me, I've asked them. I've done everything I can within the remit of my job. Any more, and they'll fire me. But you - you're not bound by such constraints. Help me out, here. Help the city out. I'll bet if you follow the trail of these murders, you'll be able to unearth the truth of this resurgence.\nPlayer: I've got better things to do than investigate a cult.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: I suppose it was quite an ask... but perhaps you wouldn't mind doing me a different, smaller favour? There are patriars on the murder target list. I'm oathbound to secure them first, so I'll be heading to the Upper City next. While I'm there, the other potential victims will be at risk.

Father - Ulder Ravengard - had just been named a Grand Duke, and was called away to Elturel to help settle a dispute. Yes - my father is a Grand Duke of Baldur's Gate, and I am his only son. That's when the Cult of the Dragon made its move.\nNarrator: *The Cult of the Dragon - a fractured religion. Some believers hold that undead dragons will inherit the world.* *Others worship your goddess, the dragon Tiamat, and intend to summon her to Faerûn.* *Others worship the dragon goddess Tiamat and intend to summon her to Faerûn.*\nPlayer: Nod and let Wyll continue his story.\nWyll: A tenday after father left, I heard a whisper as I slept. 'Dusthawk Hill. The Queen of Chaos awakens. Go alone.' I grabbed a rapier and set out. There wasn't a cloud in the sky, yet not a single star was shining. There they were, gathered at the foot of the Hill.\nNarrator: *Your head tingles. Wyll wants to show you what happened.*\nPlayer: Allow Wyll to share his memory with you.\nNarrator: *In the looming shadow of the mount, five groups of five figures each encircle a lofty totem.* *Atop each totem, a dragon's head is carved, and a massive orb held in its mouth. The cultists chant, first softly, then crying to the starless sky.* *There is a crack of thunder, a gust of wind - and a dragon's white head appears in the storm.* *As the maelstrom howls, Mizora's lips press to your ear. 'She will destroy Baldur's Gate. Grant me your soul - and I will give you the power to save it', she whispers.*\nWyll: She read the terms while two devils stood witness. And I said yes. One soul for one city.\nPlayer: Is that how you lost your eye - in the battle with the Cult of the Dragon?\nWyll: It is. The one scar I ever bore of it. You were right, of course - the new eye is a sending stone, courtesy of Mizora. She uses it to track my location and call from a distance. I could flee to the Spine of the World or the depths of the Lowerdark, and still never shake her. She read the terms while two devils stood witness. And I said yes. One soul for one city.\nPlayer: It was brave, what you did for the city.",

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon’s voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar. See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy. Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace. Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver. Come. Step forward. I can see the love of Shar darken your eyes. Be welcome.\nPlayer: May Shar guide your blessing hands.\nMalus Thorm: And the rough vessels that are yours. Tell me, what is the guiding principle of the goddess?\nPlayer: Secrecy.\nMalus Thorm: I profess there is another more profound.\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly. It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nWyll: Hells. Only a monster would inflict misery and call it medicine.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being? If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: But you: look how the succour of Shar eludes even you, one who walks faithfully in her shadow. See how painfully present you remain... We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: Your subject is tainted. Shar's succour must only be granted to the willing.\nMalus Thorm: Hmmm. 'Only the willing may know the Lady's embrace.' You know her teachings well. And yet, these sisters must exercise their gifts, for the art of absence lies in its execution. How to proceed, I wonder.\nPlayer: Sparring is vital to progress. Have them practice on each other. Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\nMalus Thorm: Yes... For are we not all in need of a cure? The scalpel does not discriminate. Let each and every one of you partake in its soothing journey. Absence, sisters. Acquaint yourselves.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) Screaming and slashing, the sisters brutally murder each other.\nMalus Thorm: It is a proud moment when one sees one's teachings so lovingly taken to heart. You are to be commended for their graduation - rewarded with the promised cure. Come, I will acquaint you with the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nPlayer: I am but a fumbling squire before a master swordsman. Please, demonstrate so that I might learn. I would rather acquaint myself - if you show me how.\nMalus Thorm: Your diligence is exemplary. Very well: your own scalpel you will be. Observe - then succeed me, into the succour of Shar.",

I don't suppose you've stumbled across any githyanki eggs during your travels? The Society will compensate you for any we purchase, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54]) Would you consider parting with it? The Society's coffers are deep enough to cover any expenses accrued in its retrieval, of course.

The githyanki have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months. You yourself have no doubt experienced the prejudice of those who assume that, as beings of the Underdark, we are inherently evil. The githyanki face similar prejudice, but I believe, if hatched in a less violent, more intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome its evil predispositions. I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: So the child inside will be experimented on?\nHavkelaag: Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue. Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: So you, too, follow the teachings of Bahamut. Why him?\nHavkelaag: In my years of study, they're the closest I've found to moral perfection. Only under such rigorous 'goodness' will the subject stand a chance of being cured. My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: Sounds pointless. Public opinion will hardly be swayed by such a small experiment.\nHavkelaag: Not at first. But if the experiment proves successful, it must be repeated. Only then will we know if the findings are to be trusted. Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg?

    "conversation": "[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) We see the Surgeon stand by a table upon which a wriggling human lies strapped down in an X position. Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon’s voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar. See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy. Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace. Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver. Come. Step forward. You are no sister, but that matters none. Every student is welcome.\nPlayer: What wrong has this man done to deserve such torture?\nMalus Thorm: Behold, sisters, the very face of ignorance - one who mistakes tenderness for torture. Go on. Acquaint the face of ignorance with the true object of our studies.\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly. It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nWyll: Hells. Only a monster would inflict misery and call it medicine.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being? If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: But you: look how the succour of Shar eludes you. See how painfully present you remain... We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: The goddess has greater plans for me than to submit to your scalpels.\nMalus Thorm: Another absence is your fate? But if you are not here to be cured, how will my sisters learn? Their incisions are, as yet, still streaked with imprecision - that much I must concede. How to steady their hands, I wonder.\nPlayer: Sparring is vital to progress. Have them practice on each other. Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\nMalus Thorm: Yes... For are we not all in need of a cure? The scalpel does not discriminate. Let each and every one of you partake in its soothing journey. Absence, sisters. Acquaint yourselves.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) Screaming and slashing, the sisters brutally murder each other.\nMalus Thorm: It is a proud moment when one sees one's teachings so lovingly taken to heart. You are to be commended for their graduation - rewarded with the promised cure. Come, I will acquaint you with the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nPlayer: My magic has blinded me - I see now that Shar is the only path. Show me how - I beg of you. I would rather acquaint myself - if you show me how.\nMalus Thorm: Your diligence is exemplary. Very well: your own scalpel you will be. Observe - then succeed me, into the succour of Shar.",

The surgeon’s voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar. See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy. Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace. Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver. Come. Step forward. You are no sister, but that matters none. Every student is welcome.\nPlayer: What wrong has this man done to deserve such torture?\nMalus Thorm: Behold, sisters, the very face of ignorance - one who mistakes tenderness for torture. Go on. Acquaint the face of ignorance with the true object of our studies.\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly. It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nShadowheart: A stinging truth - but a truth nonetheless.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being? If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: But you: look how the succour of Shar eludes you. See how painfully present you remain... We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: Their blades are uneven. Efficient surgery will require further training.\nMalus Thorm: Their incisions are, as yet, still streaked with imprecision - that much I must concede. How to steady their hands, I wonder.\nPlayer: Practice - that's how I got good with a blade. They should spar each other. Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\nMalus Thorm: Yes... For are we not all in need of a cure? The scalpel does not discriminate. Let each and every one of you partake in its soothing journey. Absence, sisters. Acquaint yourselves.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) Screaming and slashing, the sisters brutally murder each other.\nMalus Thorm: It is a proud moment when one sees one's teachings so lovingly taken to heart. You are to be commended for their graduation - rewarded with the promised cure. Come, I will acquaint you with the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nPlayer: I am but a fumbling squire before a master swordsman. Please, demonstrate so that I might learn. I would rather acquaint myself - if you show me how.\nMalus Thorm: Your diligence is exemplary. Very well: your own scalpel you will be. Observe - then succeed me, into the succour of Shar.",

My son a monster, twisted almost beyond recognition. To think my blood flows through those veins. Is this my fate - to rise from death into a hell of my own boy's making?\nWyll: It isn't what you think.

It is exactly what I think.\nPlayer: I'm beginning to think we should have let you drown.\nWyll: No, please. Father - let me show you.\nNarrator: *Ravengard's tadpole clenches as your memories - and Wyll's - flow into him.*\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: By Tyr's wounds - I'm in your mind...\nNarrator: *The Grand Duke sees Mizora and her infernal sisters. He sees the agony in Wyll's face as an impossible choice is set before him.*\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: No. My son -\nNarrator: *The past becomes present, and Wyll's thoughts are laid bare. Ravengard sees Wyll partnering with Mizora to defeat Tiamat's cultists before they could lay siege to Baldur's Gate.* *And he sees everything beyond. The nautiloid journey, the perilous path to Moonrise, the Astral Prism, and the Emperor within.*\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Wyll.\nWyll: Everything I did, I did for Baldur's Gate. I did for you.\nPlayer: Say nothing.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: My son, you sold your soul to save Baldur's Gate - and I cast you out for it. You gave yourself to the Hells' eternal fires so I might walk free. By the gods, can you ever forgive me?\nWyll: There's nothing to forgive. You wanted to protect the city. I only ever wanted the same.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: You are a better man than most, and a better son than I deserve. I'll yet make amends, but - - my duty is first and foremost to the city and its people. There's something I must ask of you.\nPlayer: Go on.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Before I was captured, I was on a mission. Returning from Elturel, I discovered the plans of the Absolutists. I immediately realised the city couldn't defend itself against such an army. I didn't despair because the city has a secret guardian, a wyrm that sleeps beneath. He can be called upon in times of great need. This is such a time. You've been trained in the ways of the great champions and proven to be one of them. The wyrm will answer your call. You must seek him out.\nPlayer: Waking a dragon doesn't sound like a good idea.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: This is no ordinary dragon. The wyrm goes by many names. Ansur. The Waiting Storm. The Heart of the Gate. He promised Balduran he'd protect the city if ever its existence was threatened. But just the once. Since then, the city has faced countless threats, but we always overcame. There was never a need to call on the wyrm - until now. The Absolute is the greatest threat Baldur's Gate ever faced. The wyrm must be awakened - and the task falls to you. There is a tome - 'The Legend of Ansur'. An ancient epic, ill-remembered, dismissed as a mere tale. I once held a copy, but it was stolen. Find it, let it set the path before you. Let it set the path before you.\nPlayer: Wyll? What do you make of this?",

Whatever your business, I'd see to it quickly - the druids are forcing everyone out. This attack will only strengthen their resolve.\nPlayer: I have no quarrel with druids.\nZevlor: There have been several attacks by different monsters. The druids blame us 'outsiders' for drawing them here. Nobody's welcome anymore. They've started a ritual to cut the grove off from the world outside. We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: What brought you here?\nZevlor: We're refugees from Elturel - we took shelter here after gnolls attacked us on the road. We were bound for Baldur's Gate, and it was too late to turn back. Elturel had no place for tieflings after the Descent.\nNarrator: *You remember it. Elturel and all its citizens were dragged into Avernus - then back out again.*\nPlayer: I was there, you know. I'd hoped you'd had a happy ending.\nZevlor: We got out alive. That's what matters. And you did too, by the looks of things. We'll live to tell another tale, if we can just convince these druids not to turn us out on our backsides. We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: What brought you here?\nZevlor: We're refugees from Elturel - we took shelter here after gnolls attacked us on the road.

But their ritual will force you out, too. We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: This ritual - is there no way to convince the druids to stop it?\nZevlor: I've tried. Kagha - their new First Druid - won't even see me. You, though... I know it's not your business, but she owes you for saving this place. Perhaps you could persuade her. For more time to prepare, if nothing else.\nPlayer: I'll see what I can do. I'll find her. And I'll speak to Kagha while I'm there.",

She swallows, then begins hacking coughing. The moonlight dissipates. She quickly goes from seeming like a divine spirit to a normal young woman.\nIsobel: I didn't realise I had an audience.\nFist Marcus: Isobel. This is -\nIsobel: A Sharran.\nNarrator: *Isobel. The same name as Ketheric Thorm's daughter - the one whose sarcophagus you found empty in the family mausoleum.*\nPlayer: Push your Urges down. Isobel - Isobel Thorm?\nNarrator: *Her breath catches; you notice a barely-perceptible shudder run through her body.*\nIsobel: An unfortunate coincidence. I hope never to meet the wicked man who haemorrhaged shadows over this peaceful village. I've heard you might be the person to stop him. A True Soul with a soul. Imagine. But if you are who I think you are, I'd be a fool to reject your help. The True Soul with... well, a soul. Imagine.\nPlayer: You seem to have a lot to say about my allegiance.

Oh - aren't you looking for a protection spell?\nPlayer: I am already protected. My Lady shields me from the curse.\nIsobel: For now, perhaps. But Shar can be fickle, and her love can prove fleeting. Do not turn your back on an advantage you may need... even a Selûnite one. If nothing else, it can aid any companions who travel with you - somehow I doubt Shar's largesse was extended to them.\nPlayer: Ngh... it hurts...\nIsobel: Well! If the Moonmaiden didn't strike me dead for blessing you, she must rather approve of this little alliance. This will block the lesser effects of the shadow curse, allowing you to traverse the darkness outside... should Shar's own protection falter, that is. It won't be enough to protect you against areas of utter darkness, though - where the curse is strongest. This lantern should, though.\nPlayer: Very nice of you, but I've been to Moonrise Towers already.\nIsobel: You... have. Forgive me for gilding the lily.

He can be called upon in times of great need. This is such a time. You've been trained in the ways of the great champions and proven to be one of them. The wyrm will answer your call.

And I thought you'd abandoned them, more fool me. The wyrm goes by many names. Ansur. The Waiting Storm. The Heart of the Gate. He promised Balduran he'd protect the city if ever its existence was threatened. But just the once. Since then, the city has faced countless threats, but we always overcame. There was never a need to call on the wyrm - until now. The Absolute is the greatest threat Baldur's Gate ever faced. The wyrm must be awakened - and the task falls to you.

    "conversation": "Wyll: It's funny. As the Blade, I've faced untold brutes and beasts. Together we've seen illithid horrors most souls could merely fathom. I live at the mercy of fiends. A man with the horrid face of a devil, awaiting his future in Hells' blistered army. But I've only now come to see who my true enemy's been.\nPlayer: You, yourself?\nWyll: I'd like to think not. The answer is much simpler than that: Time. Time is so gods-damned greedy. It can never give, only take. It builds mountains and deserts, only to tear them asunder. It fells armies, it conquers kings, queens - even gods. We blink, and we're gone. And our hopes, our memories, our heart-bonds are gone with us. Lucky for us, I've found a way to stop time - If just for a moment. Come, let me show you.\nPlayer: Go on - I'll follow.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: The scene fades back in. Wyll and the player are near the Chionthar, and walk towards a towering and impressive tree. Acorns are scattered underneath it. It is a beautiful night; the moon and stars shine bright. NOTE: Karlach CANNOT take Wyll's hand, they shouldn't be touching.See N41\nWyll: The Wilden Oak. Legend has it it's stood since the Age of Dawn. I used to come here and climb it when father's eye was turned elsewhere - daydream of the stories it might tell, if I listened close enough. The dragon lords sparking the skies above it. The moon elves first plucking the strings of the Weave. Standing here, I feel like I can see into forever.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: The camera moves from the two of you and outwards. A vista of stunning and quiet beauty.\nPlayer: I'm not sure I can see into forever. But it's still a nice view.\nWyll: My favourite in all of the Coast. All of Faerûn, even. Not even the Sea of Stars could rival its magnificence - Nor could it rival yours.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Wyll kneels to the ground. He takes an acorn and holds it in the palm of his hands, but keeps them close to his body.\nWyll: My mother always said the Wilden Oak's acorns held just a touch of wishing magic. If that be so, then may my greatest wish come true tonight: I love you. Will you be mine - today, and tomorrow, and reaching into eternity?\nPlayer: I'm not sure. It's a lot to take in.\nWyll: It is. I swear, I've lived a thousand lives since I've known you. But I'm ready to live a thousand more, if you can bear me.\nPlayer: Yes. I want to be with you, for as long as you'll have me.\nWyll: Gods. You've made me the happiest soul in all the Realms.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: The player takes the acorn from Wyll's hands. He smiles, but remains kneeling.\nNarrator: *Your skin flushes and your soul sings as you palm the acorn. Wishing magic, affection, love - whatever the cause, it's as real as the ground beneath you.*\nWyll: Get down here, already. It's time we started our happily-ever-after!\nPlayer: Shit, yes. Let's see the snake this devil's been hiding.",

    "conversation": "Player: Go on. A wyrm? Are you saying there's a dragon living under the city?\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: A bronze dragon, yes. He sleeps beneath us even now, awaiting a hero to rouse him. The wyrm goes by many names. Ansur. The Waiting Storm. The Heart of the Gate. He promised Balduran he'd protect the city if ever its existence was threatened. But just the once. Since then, the city has faced countless threats, but we always overcame. There was never a need to call on the wyrm - until now. The Absolute is the greatest threat Baldur's Gate ever faced. The wyrm must be awakened - and the task falls to you. There is a tome - 'The Legend of Ansur'. An ancient epic, ill-remembered, dismissed as a mere tale. I once held a copy, but it was stolen. Find it, let it set the path before you. Let it set the path before you.\nPlayer: Wyll? What do you make of this?\nWyll: I failed, father. The wyrm is fallen.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: A terrible fate for Ansur, my son. Yet my hopes for the city's future have never been higher.\nWyll: I don't understand.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: You and your allies slayed the undead terror that was once the great Ansur. You are stronger than even the great wyrm. You will be the one to part the storms and lead the people through. You, not Ansur, are the saviour we need. First, you will fell the Absolute. Then, we will rebuild Baldur's Gate, we will take back our city - together. I will name you Baldur's Gate's newest Grand Duke of the Council. You will be hailed Heart of the Gate.\nWyll: Grand Duke? I look the part of a fiend.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: I will tell the citizens and the patriars of your good works. They will know you carry your father's banner. But it is true - you are still under the she-devil's thumb...\nNarrator: *Uncertainty fills the air. Wyll has reached a fork in his path. In which direction will he travel?*\nPlayer: I trust you, Wyll. Follow your heart, wherever it leads.\nWyll: I fought to right the wrongs of the Coast, to slay the men and monsters that hunt the helpless. It is in the wilds that I find my courage, not in the halls of Upper City estates. There will be no Grand Duke Wyll Ravengard. And there will be no Blade of Frontiers. I am now the Blade of Avernus. For as long as demons and devils imperil the Sword Coast, they will be my prey.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Then go with my blessing. Be Faerûn's great defender. Courage. Insight. Strategy. Justice. Let these be the lights that guide you, my son. Hail the Blade of Avernus!\nMinsc: The Blade of Avernus!\nNarrator: *A calm settles over you. The elder brain is a menace - but with the Blade of Avernus at your side, you know you can triumph.*",

He can be called upon in times of great need. This is such a time. You've been trained in the ways of the great champions and proven to be one of them. The wyrm will answer your call.

    "conversation": "Wyll: It's funny. As the Blade, I've faced untold brutes and beasts. Together we've seen illithid horrors most souls could merely fathom. I live at the mercy of fiends. A devil's plaything awaiting a future in the Hells. But I've only now come to see who my true enemy's been.\nPlayer: The archdevil Zariel?\nWyll: So you'd think. But the right answer is much simpler than that: Time. Time is so gods-damned greedy. It can never give, only take. It builds mountains and deserts, only to tear them asunder. It fells armies, it conquers kings, queens - even gods. We blink, and we're gone. And our hopes, our memories, our heart-bonds are gone with us. Lucky for us, I've found a way to stop time - If just for a moment. Come, let me show you.\nPlayer: I can't take your hand without hurting you, but I'll follow where you lead.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: The scene fades back in. Wyll and the player are near the Chionthar, and walk towards a towering and impressive tree. Acorns are scattered underneath it. It is a beautiful night; the moon and stars shine bright. NOTE: Karlach CANNOT take Wyll's hand, they shouldn't be touching.See N41\nWyll: The Wilden Oak. Legend has it it's stood since the Age of Dawn. I used to come here and climb it when father's eye was turned elsewhere - daydream of the stories it might tell, if I listened close enough. The dragon lords sparking the skies above it. The moon elves first plucking the strings of the Weave. Standing here, I feel like I can see into forever.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: The camera moves from the two of you and outwards. A vista of stunning and quiet beauty.\nPlayer: Enjoy the view. Enjoy Wyll's quiet company.\nWyll: I've been thinking a lot about forever. Moreso, I've been thinking everything that comes before - And who I want at my side as it passes.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Wyll kneels to the ground. He takes an acorn and holds it in the palm of his hands, but keeps them close to his body.\nWyll: My mother always said the Wilden Oak's acorns held just a touch of wishing magic. If that be so, then may my greatest wish come true tonight: I love you. Will you be mine - today, and tomorrow, and reaching into eternity?\nPlayer: I'm not sure. It's a lot to take in.\nWyll: It is. I swear, I've lived a thousand lives since I've known you. But I'm ready to live a thousand more, if you can bear me.\nPlayer: Yes. I want to be with you, for as long as you'll have me.\nWyll: Gods. You've made me the happiest soul in all the Realms.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: The player takes the acorn from Wyll's hands. He smiles, but remains kneeling.\nNarrator: *Your skin flushes and your soul sings as you palm the acorn. Wishing magic, affection, love - whatever the cause, it's as real as the ground beneath you.*\nWyll: Get down here, already. It's time we started our happily-ever-after!\nPlayer: It's about time. Let's see what the Blade can do with his weapon. Join Wyll in the grass. Give yourself to him completely.",

Whatever your business, I'd see to it quickly - the druids are forcing everyone out. This attack will only strengthen their resolve.\nPlayer: Those goblins - have there been many attacks like that?\nZevlor: There have been several attacks by different monsters. The druids blame us 'outsiders' for drawing them here. Nobody's welcome anymore. They've started a ritual to cut the grove off from the world outside. We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: What brought you here?\nZevlor: We're refugees from Elturel - we took shelter here after gnolls attacked us on the road. We were bound for Baldur's Gate, and it was too late to turn back. Elturel had no place for tieflings after the Descent.\nNarrator: *'The Descent' - an infernal conspiracy that had seen the entire city of Elturel briefly dragged to the Hells.*\nPlayer: If your people survived that, they'll survive anything.\nZevlor: So I hoped.

Kagha - their new First Druid - won't even see me. You, though... I know it's not your business, but she owes you for saving this place. Perhaps you could persuade her. For more time to prepare, if nothing else.\nPlayer: I have my own temporal concerns. I need a healer. I'll find her. And I'll speak to Kagha while I'm there.",

I did for you.\nPlayer: Heh. I bet you feel like a real bastard right about now.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: I do. And I should. My son, you sold your soul to save Baldur's Gate - and I cast you out for it. You gave yourself to the Hells' eternal fires so I might walk free. By the gods, can you ever forgive me?\nWyll: There's nothing to forgive. You wanted to protect the city. I only ever wanted the same.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: You are a better man than most, and a better son than I deserve. I'll yet make amends, but - - my duty is first and foremost to the city and its people. There's something I must ask of you.\nPlayer: Go on.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Before I was captured, I was on a mission. Returning from Elturel, I discovered the plans of the Absolutists. I immediately realised the city couldn't defend itself against such an army. I didn't despair because the city has a secret guardian, a wyrm that sleeps beneath. He can be called upon in times of great need. This is such a time. You've been trained in the ways of the great champions and proven to be one of them. The wyrm will answer your call. You must seek him out.\nPlayer: What lessons do you mean?\nWyll: Courage. Insight. Strategy. Justice. I remember them well. You made me recite them every morning.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: So you do. And I thought you'd abandoned them, more fool me. The wyrm goes by many names. Ansur. The Waiting Storm. The Heart of the Gate. He promised Balduran he'd protect the city if ever its existence was threatened. But just the once. Since then, the city has faced countless threats, but we always overcame. There was never a need to call on the wyrm - until now. The Absolute is the greatest threat Baldur's Gate ever faced. The wyrm must be awakened - and the task falls to you. Take this - 'The Legend of Ansur'. An ancient epic, ill-remembered, dismissed as a mere tale. Let it set the path before you.\nPlayer: Your faith in Wyll is well-founded. We will seek the wyrm and ask for his help.",

Whatever your business, I'd see to it quickly - the druids are forcing everyone out. This attack will only strengthen their resolve.\nPlayer: Those goblins - have there been many attacks like that?\nZevlor: There have been several attacks by different monsters. The druids blame us 'outsiders' for drawing them here. Nobody's welcome anymore. They've started a ritual to cut the grove off from the world outside. We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: What brought you here?\nZevlor: We're refugees from Elturel - we took shelter here after gnolls attacked us on the road.

    "conversation": "Wyll: It's funny. As the Blade, I've faced untold brutes and beasts. Together we've seen illithid horrors most souls could merely fathom. I live at the mercy of fiends. A devil's plaything awaiting a future in the Hells. But I've only now come to see who my true enemy's been.\nPlayer: The archdevil Zariel?\nWyll: So you'd think. But the right answer is much simpler than that: Time. Time is so gods-damned greedy. It can never give, only take. It builds mountains and deserts, only to tear them asunder. It fells armies, it conquers kings, queens - even gods. We blink, and we're gone. And our hopes, our memories, our heart-bonds are gone with us. Lucky for us, I've found a way to stop time - If just for a moment. Come, let me show you.\nPlayer: Smile and take Wyll's hand.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: The player takes Wyll's right hand with their left. Wyll smiles and the scene fades out.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: The scene fades back in. Wyll and the player are near the Chionthar, and walk towards a towering and impressive tree. Acorns are scattered underneath it. It is a beautiful night; the moon and stars shine bright.\nWyll: The Wilden Oak. Legend has it it's stood since the Age of Dawn. I used to come here and climb it when father's eye was turned elsewhere - daydream of the stories it might tell, if I listened close enough. The dragon lords sparking the skies above it. The moon elves first plucking the strings of the Weave. Standing here, I feel like I can see into forever.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: The camera moves from the two of you and outwards. A vista of stunning and quiet beauty.\nPlayer: I'm not sure I can see into forever. But it's still a nice view.\nWyll: My favourite in all of the Coast. All of Faerûn, even. Not even the Sea of Stars could rival its magnificence - Nor could it rival yours.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Wyll kneels to the ground. He takes an acorn and holds it in the palm of his hands, but keeps them close to his body.\nWyll: My mother always said the Wilden Oak's acorns held just a touch of wishing magic. If that be so, then may my greatest wish come true tonight: I love you. Will you be mine - today, and tomorrow, and reaching into eternity?\nPlayer: I'm not sure. It's a lot to take in.\nWyll: It is. I swear, I've lived a thousand lives since I've known you. But I'm ready to live a thousand more, if you can bear me.\nPlayer: Yes. I want to be with you, for as long as you'll have me.\nWyll: Gods. You've made me the happiest soul in all the Realms.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: The player takes the acorn from Wyll's hands. He smiles, but remains kneeling.\nNarrator: *Your skin flushes and your soul sings as you palm the acorn. Wishing magic, affection, love - whatever the cause, it's as real as the ground beneath you.*\nWyll: Get down here, already. It's time we started our happily-ever-after! Get down here, already. It's time we started our happily-ever-after!\nPlayer: It's about time. Let's see what the Blade can do with his weapon. Join Wyll in the grass. Give yourself to him completely.",

I'll yet make amends, but - - my duty is first and foremost to the city and its people. There's something I must ask of you.\nPlayer: Go on.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Before I was captured, I was on a mission. Returning from Elturel, I discovered the plans of the Absolutists. I immediately realised the city couldn't defend itself against such an army. I didn't despair because the city has a secret guardian, a wyrm that sleeps beneath.

You must seek him out.\nPlayer: What lessons do you mean?\nWyll: Courage. Insight. Strategy. Justice. I remember them well. You made me recite them every morning.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: So you do. And I thought you'd abandoned them, more fool me. The wyrm goes by many names. Ansur. The Waiting Storm. The Heart of the Gate. He promised Balduran he'd protect the city if ever its existence was threatened. But just the once. Since then, the city has faced countless threats, but we always overcame. There was never a need to call on the wyrm - until now. The Absolute is the greatest threat Baldur's Gate ever faced. The wyrm must be awakened - and the task falls to you.

A man with the horrid face of a devil, awaiting his future in Hells' blistered army. But I've only now come to see who my true enemy's been.\nPlayer: The poignant tedium of your story?\nWyll: I'd like to think not. The answer is much simpler than that: Time. Time is so gods-damned greedy. It can never give, only take. It builds mountains and deserts, only to tear them asunder. It fells armies, it conquers kings, queens - even gods. We blink, and we're gone. And our hopes, our memories, our heart-bonds are gone with us. Lucky for us, I've found a way to stop time - If just for a moment. Come, let me show you.\nPlayer: I can't take your hand without hurting you, but I'll follow where you lead.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: The scene fades back in.

I used to come here and climb it when father's eye was turned elsewhere - daydream of the stories it might tell, if I listened close enough. The dragon lords sparking the skies above it.

If that be so, then may my greatest wish come true tonight: I love you. Will you be mine - today, and tomorrow, and reaching into eternity?\nPlayer: Take the acorn and nod.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: The player takes the acorn from Wyll's hands.

Ravengard sees Wyll partnering with Mizora to defeat Tiamat's cultists before they could lay siege to Baldur's Gate.* *And he sees everything beyond. The nautiloid journey, the perilous path to Moonrise, the Astral Prism, and the Emperor within.*\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Wyll.\nWyll: Everything I did, I did for Baldur's Gate. I did for you.\nPlayer: It's the truth, Ravengard. Wyll has always been a faithful defender of Baldur's Gate.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: My son, you sold your soul to save Baldur's Gate - and I cast you out for it. You gave yourself to the Hells' eternal fires so I might walk free. By the gods, can you ever forgive me?\nWyll: There's nothing to forgive. You wanted to protect the city. I only ever wanted the same.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: You are a better man than most, and a better son than I deserve. I'll yet make amends, but - - my duty is first and foremost to the city and its people. There's something I must ask of you.\nPlayer: Go on.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Before I was captured, I was on a mission. Returning from Elturel, I discovered the plans of the Absolutists. I immediately realised the city couldn't defend itself against such an army. I didn't despair because the city has a secret guardian, a wyrm that sleeps beneath. He can be called upon in times of great need. This is such a time. You've been trained in the ways of the great champions and proven to be one of them. The wyrm will answer your call. You must seek him out.\nPlayer: A wyrm? Are you saying there's a dragon living under the city?\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: A bronze dragon, yes. He sleeps beneath us even now, awaiting a hero to rouse him. The wyrm goes by many names. Ansur. The Waiting Storm. The Heart of the Gate. He promised Balduran he'd protect the city if ever its existence was threatened. But just the once. Since then, the city has faced countless threats, but we always overcame. There was never a need to call on the wyrm - until now. The Absolute is the greatest threat Baldur's Gate ever faced. The wyrm must be awakened - and the task falls to you. Take this - 'The Legend of Ansur'. An ancient epic, ill-remembered, dismissed as a mere tale. Let it set the path before you.\nPlayer: Your faith in Wyll is well-founded. We will seek the wyrm and ask for his help.",

I did for you.\nPlayer: It's time you two made up. We've got a city to save.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: All too right. My son, you sold your soul to save Baldur's Gate - and I cast you out for it. You gave yourself to the Hells' eternal fires so I might walk free. By the gods, can you ever forgive me?\nWyll: There's nothing to forgive. You wanted to protect the city. I only ever wanted the same.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: You are a better man than most, and a better son than I deserve. I'll yet make amends, but - - my duty is first and foremost to the city and its people. There's something I must ask of you.\nPlayer: Go on.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Before I was captured, I was on a mission. Returning from Elturel, I discovered the plans of the Absolutists. I immediately realised the city couldn't defend itself against such an army. I didn't despair because the city has a secret guardian, a wyrm that sleeps beneath. He can be called upon in times of great need. This is such a time. You've been trained in the ways of the great champions and proven to be one of them. The wyrm will answer your call. You must seek him out.\nPlayer: Waking a dragon doesn't sound like a good idea.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: This is no ordinary dragon. The wyrm goes by many names. Ansur. The Waiting Storm. The Heart of the Gate. He promised Balduran he'd protect the city if ever its existence was threatened. But just the once. Since then, the city has faced countless threats, but we always overcame. There was never a need to call on the wyrm - until now. The Absolute is the greatest threat Baldur's Gate ever faced. The wyrm must be awakened - and the task falls to you. Take this - 'The Legend of Ansur'. An ancient epic, ill-remembered, dismissed as a mere tale. Let it set the path before you.\nPlayer: Wyll? What do you make of this?",

It's always been Mizora.\nWyll: So you'd think. But the right answer is much simpler than that: Time. Time is so gods-damned greedy. It can never give, only take.

You are stronger than even the great wyrm. You will be the one to part the storms and lead the people through. You, not Ansur, are the saviour we need. First, you will fell the Absolute.

No manner of duke should be tied to a devil's leash. No manner of duke should save a city, only to open a gate to the Hells. There will be no Grand Duke Wyll Ravengard.

This attack will only strengthen their resolve.\nPlayer: I have no quarrel with druids.\nZevlor: There have been several attacks by different monsters.

Aradin's a blowhard, but that's no cause for me to join him. Thank you for your help out there. I'm Zevlor. And if I'm not mistaken, you're the Blade of Frontiers.\nPlayer: What is this place?\nZevlor: A druids' grove, dedicated to the Oak Father, Silvanus. You'll find its keepers just as thorny, I fear. Whatever your business, I'd see to it quickly - the druids are forcing everyone out. This attack will only strengthen their resolve.\nPlayer: I have no quarrel with druids.\nZevlor: There have been several attacks by different monsters. The druids blame us 'outsiders' for drawing them here. Nobody's welcome anymore. They've started a ritual to cut the grove off from the world outside. We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: What brought you here?\nZevlor: We're refugees from Elturel - we took shelter here after gnolls attacked us on the road. We were bound for Baldur's Gate, and it was too late to turn back. Elturel had no place for tieflings after the Descent.\nNarrator: *You remember it. Elturel and all its citizens were dragged into Avernus - then back out again.*\nPlayer: I was there, you know. I'd hoped you'd had a happy ending.\nZevlor: We got out alive. That's what matters. And you did too, by the looks of things. We'll live to tell another tale, if we can just convince these druids not to turn us out on our backsides. We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: What brought you here?\nZevlor: We're refugees from Elturel - we took shelter here after gnolls attacked us on the road.

Elturel and all its citizens were dragged into Avernus - then back out again.*\nPlayer: Let me guess: Your old neighbours called you 'devilkin' and acted like they never knew you.\nZevlor: How easily such a nasty word slips through the mouth of someone you thought you knew. We thought we'd found sanctuary here, but the druids have determined to turn us out. We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: This ritual - is there no way to convince the druids to stop it?\nZevlor: I've tried. Kagha - their new First Druid - won't even see me. You, though... I know it's not your business, but she owes you for saving this place. Perhaps you could persuade her. For more time to prepare, if nothing else.\nPlayer: I'll see what I can do. I'll find her. And I'll speak to Kagha while I'm there.",

A vista of stunning and quiet beauty.\nPlayer: Seriously? You dragged me out here to look at a tree?\nWyll: I did. But also to see something else: Me. I've been thinking a lot about forever. Moreso, I've been thinking everything that comes before - And who I want at my side as it passes.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Wyll kneels to the ground. He takes an acorn and holds it in the palm of his hands, but keeps them close to his body.\nWyll: My mother always said the Wilden Oak's acorns held just a touch of wishing magic. If that be so, then may my greatest wish come true tonight: I love you. Will you be mine - today, and tomorrow, and reaching into eternity?\nPlayer: Yes, yes, yes!",

Thank you for your help out there. I'm Zevlor. And if I'm not mistaken, you're the Blade of Frontiers.\nPlayer: Please - it's just Wyll.\nZevlor: Well met, by whatever name. Though I'm afraid that's all the welcome we can give you. Whatever your business, I'd see to it quickly - the druids are forcing everyone out. This attack will only strengthen their resolve.\nPlayer: Those goblins - have there been many attacks like that?\nZevlor: There have been several attacks by different monsters. The druids blame us 'outsiders' for drawing them here. Nobody's welcome anymore. They've started a ritual to cut the grove off from the world outside. We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: What brought you here?\nZevlor: We're refugees from Elturel - we took shelter here after gnolls attacked us on the road. We were bound for Baldur's Gate, and it was too late to turn back. Elturel had no place for tieflings after the Descent.\nKarlach: Gods, these are those tiefs? Their whole city was dragged into Avernus for a while. Zariel was delighted. When they made it back out, I'd hoped they got their happy ending.\nNarrator: *'The Descent' - an infernal conspiracy that had seen the entire city of Elturel briefly dragged to the Hells.*\nPlayer: If your people survived that, they'll survive anything.\nZevlor: So I hoped. But we've lost so many already - and more will die if we're forced out again. We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: What brought you here?\nZevlor: We're refugees from Elturel - we took shelter here after gnolls attacked us on the road. We were bound for Baldur's Gate, and it was too late to turn back. Elturel had no place for tieflings after the Descent.\nPlayer: Is there a place for tieflings anywhere?\nZevlor: Hah - a fair point. We can only hope the citizens of Baldur's Gate are more open-minded. But we can't get there with those beasts blocking our path. We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: This ritual - is there no way to convince the druids to stop it?\nZevlor: I've tried. Kagha - their new First Druid - won't even see me. You, though... I know it's not your business, but she owes you for saving this place. Perhaps you could persuade her. For more time to prepare, if nothing else.\nPlayer: I'll see what I can do. I'll find her. And I'll speak to Kagha while I'm there.",

But I will not celebrate this infernal resurrection. You turned your back on me, on your city, to chase the she-devil and her power. She stinks up this place even now.\nNarrator: *Your head tingles.

The nautiloid journey, the perilous path to Moonrise, the Astral Prism, and the Emperor within.*\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Wyll.\nWyll: Everything I did, I did for Baldur's Gate. I did for you.\nPlayer: It's the truth, Ravengard. Wyll has always been a faithful defender of Baldur's Gate.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: My son, you sold your soul to save Baldur's Gate - and I cast you out for it. You gave yourself to the Hells' eternal fires so I might walk free. By the gods, can you ever forgive me?\nWyll: There's nothing to forgive. You wanted to protect the city. I only ever wanted the same.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: You are a better man than most, and a better son than I deserve. I'll yet make amends, but - - my duty is first and foremost to the city and its people. There's something I must ask of you.\nPlayer: Go on.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Before I was captured, I was on a mission. Returning from Elturel, I discovered the plans of the Absolutists. I immediately realised the city couldn't defend itself against such an army. I didn't despair because the city has a secret guardian, a wyrm that sleeps beneath. He can be called upon in times of great need. This is such a time. You've been trained in the ways of the great champions and proven to be one of them. The wyrm will answer your call. You must seek him out.\nPlayer: A wyrm? Are you saying there's a dragon living under the city?\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: A bronze dragon, yes. He sleeps beneath us even now, awaiting a hero to rouse him. The wyrm goes by many names. Ansur. The Waiting Storm. The Heart of the Gate. He promised Balduran he'd protect the city if ever its existence was threatened. But just the once. Since then, the city has faced countless threats, but we always overcame. There was never a need to call on the wyrm - until now. The Absolute is the greatest threat Baldur's Gate ever faced. The wyrm must be awakened - and the task falls to you. Take this - 'The Legend of Ansur'. An ancient epic, ill-remembered, dismissed as a mere tale. Let it set the path before you.\nPlayer: Wyll? What do you make of this?",

Whatever your business, I'd see to it quickly - the druids are forcing everyone out. This attack will only strengthen their resolve.\nPlayer: Outsiders, perhaps. But not me.\nZevlor: Lucky you. There have been several attacks by different monsters. The druids blame us 'outsiders' for drawing them here. Nobody's welcome anymore. They've started a ritual to cut the grove off from the world outside. We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: What brought you here?\nZevlor: We're refugees from Elturel - we took shelter here after gnolls attacked us on the road. We were bound for Baldur's Gate, and it was too late to turn back. Elturel had no place for tieflings after the Descent.\nKarlach: Gods, these are those tiefs? Their whole city was dragged into Avernus for a while. Zariel was delighted. When they made it back out, I'd hoped they got their happy ending.\nNarrator: *'The Descent' - an infernal conspiracy that had seen the entire city of Elturel briefly dragged to the Hells.*\nPlayer: If your people survived that, they'll survive anything.\nZevlor: So I hoped. But we've lost so many already - and more will die if we're forced out again. We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: This ritual - is there no way to convince the druids to stop it?\nZevlor: I've tried. Kagha - their new First Druid - won't even see me. You, though... I know it's not your business, but she owes you for saving this place. Perhaps you could persuade her.

Thank you for your help out there. I'm Zevlor. And if I'm not mistaken, you're the Blade of Frontiers.\nPlayer: Please - it's just Wyll.\nZevlor: Well met, by whatever name. Though I'm afraid that's all the welcome we can give you. Whatever your business, I'd see to it quickly - the druids are forcing everyone out. This attack will only strengthen their resolve.\nPlayer: Those goblins - have there been many attacks like that?\nZevlor: There have been several attacks by different monsters. The druids blame us 'outsiders' for drawing them here. Nobody's welcome anymore. They've started a ritual to cut the grove off from the world outside. We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: What brought you here?\nZevlor: We're refugees from Elturel - we took shelter here after gnolls attacked us on the road. We were bound for Baldur's Gate, and it was too late to turn back. Elturel had no place for tieflings after the Descent.\nNarrator: *'The Descent' - an infernal conspiracy that had seen the entire city of Elturel briefly dragged to the Hells.*\nPlayer: If your people survived that, they'll survive anything.\nZevlor: So I hoped. But we've lost so many already - and more will die if we're forced out again. We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: What brought you here?\nZevlor: We're refugees from Elturel - we took shelter here after gnolls attacked us on the road. We were bound for Baldur's Gate, and it was too late to turn back. Elturel had no place for tieflings after the Descent.\nNarrator: *You remember it. Elturel and all its citizens were dragged into Avernus - then back out again.*\nPlayer: Let me guess: Your old neighbours called you 'devilkin' and acted like they never knew you.\nZevlor: How easily such a nasty word slips through the mouth of someone you thought you knew. We thought we'd found sanctuary here, but the druids have determined to turn us out. We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: This ritual - is there no way to convince the druids to stop it?\nZevlor: I've tried. Kagha - their new First Druid - won't even see me. You, though... I know it's not your business, but she owes you for saving this place. Perhaps you could persuade her. For more time to prepare, if nothing else.\nPlayer: I have my own temporal concerns. I need a healer. I'll find her. And I'll speak to Kagha while I'm there.",

The Sword Coast's most dashing fraud.\nNodeContext: Include Florrick Spitting before saying line.\nCounsellor Florrick: You are either a fool for trusting him - or a wretch for conspiring with him. It doesn't matter which. Lady Mizora told me everything. How Wyll slaughtered his own father, how he craves his power. How he means to make the city bow to him and him alone. This city holds no place for you - or for Ravengard's treacherous spawn.\nPlayer: Ravengard's death was Gortash's doing. There was nothing we could do.\nCounsellor Florrick: At ease. By the living gods, I believe you. What darkness has fallen upon us. There's something you must know. I should've told Wyll sooner, but I'd hoped somehow Ravengard would return to us. He knew about the Absolute. I thought little of it at first - but he realised the danger before anyone else did. He understood that if the cult were successful in raising an army, Baldur's Gate would be doomed. Before the Absolutists abducted him, he told me that should he fall, I should seek Wyll out and give him a message. Wyll was schooled in the ways of the great champions. He is to use those lessons to wake the wyrm sleeping beneath Baldur's Gate. The wyrm is oathbound to answer the call and come to the city's aid.\nPlayer: The city has found its protector, thank you very much. Me.\nCounsellor Florrick: Only a true champion can awaken the wyrm. As the Blade of Frontiers, Wyll has proven his worth. Please - take him this message. The wyrm goes by many names. Ansur. The Waiting Storm. The Heart of the Gate. He promised Balduran he'd protect the city if ever its existence was threatened - but just the once. The city has faced countless threats. But Ravengard knew it could not survive the Absolute's slaughter. With him gone and the city near ruin, the wyrm's awakening now falls to you and Wyll. There is a tome - 'The Legend of Ansur'. An ancient epic, ill-remembered, dismissed as a mere tale. I once carried it, but it was stolen from me. Find it, let it set the path before you. Or do not, and see your home burn to ash. Let it set the path before you. Or do not, and see Baldur's Gate burn to ash.\nPlayer: Your faith is well-founded. I will take your message to Wyll.",

Finish her, and be quick about it.\nPlayer: I'm not letting you burn my flesh.\nTrue Soul Gut: Maybe you don't need me to. After all, you're special, ain't you?

A familiar sensation - she, too, carries a parasite.*\nNodeContext: internal dialogue as the player reacts to both the 'pain' from a branding iron applied (voluntarily) to their hand, and a goblin priestess exploring their mind telepathically\nPlayer: Push deeper into her mind.\nNarrator: *Her faith floods into you - a tide of shuddering ecstasy. Her tadpole nestles within that mania, secure... hidden.*\nTrue Soul Gut: You pokin' around in my mush? Works both ways, mate. An' I saw some weird shadows swimmin' around in your head just now. Maybe I can help with that... Didn't realise you were a True Soul.\nPlayer: There's a creature inside my head. Can you do anything about that?\nTrue Soul Gut: A creature? There's definitely something rotten in there. Let me take a closer look. I ain't seen anything like this before.\nPlayer: I'm pretty sure you're infected, too.\nTrue Soul Gut: Eh? Ain't nothin' wrong with me. You're the one who's sick in the head. No need to panic, though. With the Absolute's will, I can fix anything. Ready to clear your head?\nPlayer: What exactly are you going to do?\nTrue Soul Gut: Whatever the Absolute tells me to. Don't worry - She loves you. I can tell.\nPlayer: Change of plan. I'm going to kill you.",

Flaming desire and icy despair; the strength of iron and the haze of thick swamp mist.*\nMizora: The Nine Hells of Baator. The ultimate torment, some souls would say. Tsk. Those souls lack imagination.\nPlayer: I'm not so sure about this, Mizora.\nMizora: A banquet lies before you. Why should you not gorge?\nPlayer: Give in to the infernal sensations.\nMizora: I'm going to show you the true wages of your sin.\nNarrator: *Pure lust courses through your veins and plucks at your flesh. You don't know what you want, only that you want it.*\nMizora: You feel it, don't you? Primal hunger, irrepressible decadence. Forget the heavens - this is paradise. Let me show you.\nPlayer: I'm ready. Bring me the pleasures of the Hells.\nNarrator: *An inferno engulfs you. Your lust blazes hot.*\nMizora: Do you feel it? Avernus. Where Hells' legions march, screaming their rage. Where the Styx collects the blood of the fallen. Where your rightful mistress shoulders the burdens of perpetual war. Reach out. Have a taste.\nPlayer: Give it to me.\nNarrator: *The flavour is exquisite as spiced wine, terrible as rotting offal. It does not quench your lust - it only stokes it.*\n\nThe player makes a fist, the flame extinguishes, but in doing so a new flood of sensation rushes into their core. Their back and neck arch slightly as they breath deep.\nMizora: Don't worry, pet. I won't leave 'til you're fully satisfied. Dis, the blackened elysium. Minauros, the rotting bog. The molten seas and soil of Phlegethos. Stygia, the frozen ocean. Choose a Hell. Have your fill.\nPlayer: The polluted swamps of Minauros.\nNarrator: *You inhale the oily clouds of Minauros' stink. It is the stench of dead lovers and sour romances. It is the unwantable - but you still lust for more.*\n\nThe player extends both arms out toward the flames, palms down. Their eyes close as they connect with Mizora's hellish offerings.\n\nShe watches as the pleasure rides out the sensations.\nInternalNodeContext: Cannot be aliased due to VFX coloration and narration, anims resued though.\nMizora: To think how you've starved yourself up to this moment. To think how you chose the sweet over the bitter. One last choice, and starve no longer. Malbolge, the desolation. The forgotten ruins of Maladomini. Cania and its mountains of ice. Or Nessus, the seat of infernal power.\nPlayer: Maladomini, the shattered kingdom.\nNarrator: *Decaying cities, cinder forests. All that was once whole has collapsed into memories. Your body and mind dissolve into fragments, each as pure as the next. You are the perfection of form.*\n\nThe player player rotates their palms upward, and look up, basking in the arcane sensory experience.\nInternalNodeContext: Cannot be aliased due to VFX coloration and narration, anims resued though.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: The player turns and faces Mizora. She is naked, her wings spreads her wings wide.\n\nThe flame circle kicks up higher, the player and Mizora float off of the ground.\n\nJLatino: \"Mizora looks deeply into the player's eyes and pulls their hands to her breasts.\" Can we do the Into Wing beat without this, will that save anything?\nInternalNodeContext: Floating designed to aid retargeting with breast hold\n\nThe flame circle kicks up higher, the player and Mizora float off of the ground.\n\nJLatino: \"Mizora looks deeply into the player's eyes and pulls their hands to her breasts.\" Can we do the Into Wing beat without this, will that save anything?\nInternalNodeContext: Floating designed to aid retargeting with breast hold\nMizora: Take me. And know the essence of the Hells.\nPlayer: Pull away.",

Just ahead, a diabolical figure - red skin, single curled horn - blazes with flame, bloodied greataxe held high.* *It's Karlach - the woman you met in the wilds.*\nWyll: Hells' great fires - you were on the ship.\nPlayer: Who was that woman, the one in your thoughts?\nWyll: You saw her, then. Advocatus diaboli.\nNarrator: *Advocatus diaboli. A devil's advocate - a champion in the Blood War between diabolical forces and demons.*\nPlayer: Who is she, exactly?\nWyll: Karlach's her name. An archdevil's soldier I swore on my good eye to kill. I tracked her through the Hells to the mind flayer ship. But the damned illithids infected me before I could end her. She's out there now, preying on the innocent. I don't kill her, she'll leave behind nothing but a trail of corpses.\nPlayer: You have a mind flayer tadpole in your head. Doesn't that worry you?\nWyll: I'd be a fool if it didn't. I know the stories - doomed to shed my skin, become illithid. And there's no coming back. But I haven't sprouted any tentacles - least not yet, thank Balduran. Could just be good luck. But sooner or later, it's bound to run out.\nPlayer: If you're going to beat that devil of yours, you'll need my help. Let's join forces. I'll help you cast this devil back into the Hells.",
