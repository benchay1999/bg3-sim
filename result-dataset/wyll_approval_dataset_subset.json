A cure at Moonrise Towers, maybe? Sounds like guesswork at best.\nHalsin: I'm as certain as I can be. If you have a better alternative, I won't stop you.\nHalsin: I can't stop you, in fact.

But this is too much - this is unnatural.\nHalsin: It's too late to merely kill this horde's leadership - their forces are already marching.

You're aware of the monster inside you. You don't bow to the Absolute, like the True Souls do...\nHalsin: How is this possible...?\nPlayer: I escaped from an illithid ship after being infected. Maybe the process was interrupted.\nHalsin: Perhaps... but I wouldn't want to place all my faith in blind luck.\nHalsin: You weren't speaking lightly when you said you needed help. Let me tell you what I know.\nHalsin: I've been studying these parasites for a while now. Ever since I discovered these so-called True Souls are infected with them.\nHalsin: Someone is using very powerful magic to modify these tadpoles. They are using them to exert control over the infected.\nHalsin: I'm sorry to say, I can't undo that magic, which means I can't cure you. But that doesn't mean I can't help.\nHalsin: I didn't find what I came here for - a way to remove the tadpoles - but I found the next best thing. I found out where they come from.\nHalsin: That must be where these enchantments are placed on them, and it's where you'll find your cure.\nPlayer: You learned all this from your studies?\nHalsin: Indeed. After we dealt with the drow that ambushed us, Nettie and I were able to inspect the corpse - and the creature that slithered out of it.\nHalsin: I had no idea anyone beyond their ranks was infected. You have my sincere sympathies.\nPlayer: Sympathies won't help me to survive.\nHalsin: Patience. I can't just snap my fingers... but I know where the solution almost certainly lies.\nHalsin: I overheard that the cultists are sending all of their captives to Moonrise Towers.\nHalsin: Innocents go in, True Souls come out. Given that all of these True Souls are infected, it has to be the source of this magic.\nHalsin: If you want to find a cure, you must head there and discover how the tadpoles are being manipulated.\nPlayer: You seem to know a lot about this. Will you come with me to Moonrise?\nHalsin: I wish I could, but there's still work I've yet to finish - blood I've yet to spill.\nHalsin: I've no right to ask more of you... but if you could help me, I'd be free to join your journey to Moonrise.\nHalsin: I cannot allow these butchers to threaten my grove. The natural order must be protected.\nPlayer: Look around you - there's no order anymore. Only chaos.\nHalsin: Chaos is welcome, in doses; it helps keep balance. But this is too much - this is unnatural.\nHalsin: Help me kill the leaders of this horde, save my grove. Then I will help you.\n\nHalsin: Three deaths could win us peace: the drow Minthara, the hobgoblin Dror Ragzlin, and that perversion of a priestess, Gut.\nHalsin: They are the ones holding these parasites together. Remove them and nature will cure itself.\nPlayer: The grove isn't my problem. I have to concentrate on saving myself.",

You're aware of the monster inside you. You don't bow to the Absolute, like the True Souls do...\nHalsin: How is this possible...?\nPlayer: I escaped from an illithid ship after being infected.

Let me tell you what I know.\nHalsin: I've been studying these parasites for a while now. Ever since I discovered these so-called True Souls are infected with them.\nHalsin: Someone is using very powerful magic to modify these tadpoles. They are using them to exert control over the infected.\nHalsin: I'm sorry to say, I can't undo that magic, which means I can't cure you. But that doesn't mean I can't help.\nHalsin: I didn't find what I came here for - a way to remove the tadpoles - but I found the next best thing. I found out where they come from.\nHalsin: That must be where these enchantments are placed on them, and it's where you'll find your cure.\nPlayer: You learned all this from your studies?\nHalsin: Indeed. After we dealt with the drow that ambushed us, Nettie and I were able to inspect the corpse - and the creature that slithered out of it.\nHalsin: I had no idea anyone beyond their ranks was infected. You have my sincere sympathies.\nPlayer: This magic you mentioned - it isn't normal for these parasites?\nPlayer: What should I do?\nHalsin: I overheard that the cultists are sending all of their captives to Moonrise Towers.\nHalsin: Innocents go in, True Souls come out. Given that all of these True Souls are infected, it has to be the source of this magic.\nHalsin: If you want to find a cure, you must head there and discover how the tadpoles are being manipulated.\nPlayer: Altered parasites? A cure at Moonrise Towers, maybe? Sounds like guesswork at best.\nHalsin: I'm as certain as I can be. If you have a better alternative, I won't stop you.\nHalsin: I can't stop you, in fact. Which brings me to my next problem...\nHalsin: I've no right to ask more of you... but if you could help me, I'd be free to join your journey to Moonrise.\nHalsin: I cannot allow these butchers to threaten my grove. The natural order must be protected.\nPlayer: All right. How do I help?\nHalsin: My thanks. If you prevail, I'll owe you the debt of a lifetime.\nHalsin: Rare is the beast that survives decapitation. Help me eliminate the drow Minthara, the hobgoblin Dror Ragzlin, and that perversion of a priestess, Gut.\nHalsin: They are the ones holding these parasites together. Remove them and nature will cure itself.\nPlayer: You are aware you're asking me to kill a drow?\nHalsin: You drow relish turning on your own, if there's something to be gained. Don't pretend otherwise.\nPlayer: There's no pretence in not wanting to play the assassin. You're on your own.",

Her hands are in a prayer position and she's chanting softly as the moonlight dances around her. She exhales, then inhales and breaths in tendrils of shadow, absorbing them. She swallows, then begins hacking coughing. The moonlight dissipates. She quickly goes from seeming like a divine spirit to a normal young woman.\nIsobel: I didn't realise I had an audience.\nFist Marcus: Isobel. This is -\nIsobel: A Sharran.\nNarrator: *Isobel. The same name as Ketheric Thorm's daughter - the one whose sarcophagus you found empty in the family mausoleum.*\nPlayer: Push your Urges down.\nPlayer: Isobel - Isobel Thorm?\nIsobel: An unfortunate coincidence. I hope never to meet the wicked man who haemorrhaged shadows over this peaceful village. I've heard you might be the person to stop him.\nIsobel: A True Soul with a soul. Imagine.\nIsobel: But if you are who I think you are, I'd be a fool to reject your help. The True Soul with... well, a soul. Imagine.\nPlayer: You seem to have a lot to say about my allegiance. Can we focus on the task at hand?\nIsobel: I suppose that would be wise. We have a common enemy, after all: Ketheric Thorm.\nIsobel: You'll be needing the protection spell, I presume?\nIsobel: Oh - aren't you looking for a protection spell?\nPlayer: I am already protected. My Lady shields me from the curse.\nIsobel: For now, perhaps. But Shar can be fickle, and her love can prove fleeting. Do not turn your back on an advantage you may need... even a Selûnite one.\nIsobel: If nothing else, it can aid any companions who travel with you - somehow I doubt Shar's largesse was extended to them.\nPlayer: Ngh... it hurts...\nIsobel: Well! If the Moonmaiden didn't strike me dead for blessing you, she must rather approve of this little alliance.\nIsobel: This will block the lesser effects of the shadow curse, allowing you to traverse the darkness outside... should Shar's own protection falter, that is.\nIsobel: Curious. Surely the Nightsinger could have shielded all her followers, and made this place her domain long ago... yet she only acts now, and aids you alone. I wonder why.\nPlayer: That's none of your concern.\nIsobel: I suppose you're right.\nIsobel: I'll stop needling you, though. You have more important things to do, after all.\nPlayer: I've already been to Moonrise, but I have more work to do indeed.\nIsobel: I imagine so, if Jaheira hasn't gone tearing off into the night.\nPlayer: You're coming with me, cleric.",

Maybe the process was interrupted.\nHalsin: Perhaps... but I wouldn't want to place all my faith in blind luck.\nHalsin: You weren't speaking lightly when you said you needed help. Let me tell you what I know.\nHalsin: I've been studying these parasites for a while now. Ever since I discovered these so-called True Souls are infected with them.\nHalsin: Someone is using very powerful magic to modify these tadpoles. They are using them to exert control over the infected.\nHalsin: I'm sorry to say, I can't undo that magic, which means I can't cure you. But that doesn't mean I can't help.\nHalsin: I didn't find what I came here for - a way to remove the tadpoles - but I found the next best thing. I found out where they come from.\nHalsin: That must be where these enchantments are placed on them, and it's where you'll find your cure.\nPlayer: You learned all this from your studies?\nHalsin: Indeed. After we dealt with the drow that ambushed us, Nettie and I were able to inspect the corpse - and the creature that slithered out of it.\nHalsin: I had no idea anyone beyond their ranks was infected. You have my sincere sympathies.\nPlayer: This magic you mentioned - it isn't normal for these parasites?\nPlayer: Then everything we did here was hopeless.\nHalsin: Patience. I can't just snap my fingers... but I know where the solution almost certainly lies.\nHalsin: I overheard that the cultists are sending all of their captives to Moonrise Towers.\nHalsin: Innocents go in, True Souls come out. Given that all of these True Souls are infected, it has to be the source of this magic.\nHalsin: If you want to find a cure, you must head there and discover how the tadpoles are being manipulated.\nPlayer: Altered parasites? A cure at Moonrise Towers, maybe? Sounds like guesswork at best.\nHalsin: I'm as certain as I can be. If you have a better alternative, I won't stop you.\nHalsin: I can't stop you, in fact. Which brings me to my next problem...\nHalsin: I've no right to ask more of you... but if you could help me, I'd be free to join your journey to Moonrise.\nHalsin: I cannot allow these butchers to threaten my grove. The natural order must be protected.\nPlayer: Kagha was swayed by Shadow Druids. She nearly sealed the grove.\nHalsin: Kagha... I should have suspected she'd take things too far. I'll deal with her when I can.\nHalsin: But there are other matters to attend to before that.\nHalsin: Chaos is welcome, in doses; it helps keep balance. But this is too much - this is unnatural.\nHalsin: Help me kill the leaders of this horde, save my grove. Then I will help you.\n\nHalsin: Three deaths could win us peace: the drow Minthara, the hobgoblin Dror Ragzlin, and that perversion of a priestess, Gut.\nHalsin: They are the ones holding these parasites together. Remove them and nature will cure itself.\nPlayer: You are aware you're asking me to kill a drow?\nHalsin: You drow relish turning on your own, if there's something to be gained. Don't pretend otherwise.\nPlayer: There's no pretence in not wanting to play the assassin. You're on your own.",

It is a beautiful night; the moon and stars shine bright.\nWyll: The Wilden Oak.

The moon elves first plucking the strings of the Weave.\nWyll: Standing here, I feel like I can see into forever.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: The camera moves from the two of you and outwards. A vista of stunning and quiet beauty.\nPlayer: Enjoy the view. Enjoy Wyll's quiet company.\nWyll: I've been thinking a lot about forever.

He takes an acorn and holds it in the palm of his hands, but keeps them close to his body.\nWyll: My mother always said the Wilden Oak's acorns held just a touch of wishing magic.\nWyll: If that be so, then may my greatest wish come true tonight:\nWyll: I love you.

He takes an acorn and holds it in the palm of his hands, but keeps them close to his body.\nWyll: My mother always said the Wilden Oak's acorns held just a touch of wishing magic.\nWyll: If that be so, then may my greatest wish come true tonight:\nWyll: I love you.

If the Moonmaiden didn't strike me dead for blessing you, she must rather approve of this little alliance.\nIsobel: This will block the lesser effects of the shadow curse, allowing you to traverse the darkness outside... should Shar's own protection falter, that is.\nIsobel: Curious. Surely the Nightsinger could have shielded all her followers, and made this place her domain long ago... yet she only acts now, and aids you alone. I wonder why.\nPlayer: I don't know what to make of it myself.\nIsobel: I suppose Shar is nothing if not mysterious.\nIsobel: I'll stop needling you, though.

Thank you.\nHalsin: Wait - I could help you find a cure... but I need to settle matters here first.\nHalsin: I've no right to ask more of you... but if you could help me, I'd be free to join your journey to Moonrise.\nHalsin: I cannot allow these butchers to threaten my grove. The natural order must be protected.\nPlayer: Kagha was swayed by Shadow Druids. She nearly sealed the grove.\nHalsin: Kagha... I should have suspected she'd take things too far. I'll deal with her when I can.\nHalsin: But there are other matters to attend to before that.\nHalsin: Chaos is welcome, in doses; it helps keep balance. But this is too much - this is unnatural.\nHalsin: Help me kill the leaders of this horde, save my grove. Then I will help you.\n\nHalsin: Three deaths could win us peace: the drow Minthara, the hobgoblin Dror Ragzlin, and that perversion of a priestess, Gut.\nHalsin: They are the ones holding these parasites together. Remove them and nature will cure itself.\nPlayer: The grove isn't my problem. I have to concentrate on saving myself.",

I found out where they come from.\nHalsin: That must be where these enchantments are placed on them, and it's where you'll find your cure.\nPlayer: You learned all this from your studies?\nHalsin: Indeed. After we dealt with the drow that ambushed us, Nettie and I were able to inspect the corpse - and the creature that slithered out of it.\nHalsin: I had no idea anyone beyond their ranks was infected. You have my sincere sympathies.\nPlayer: Sympathies won't help me to survive.\nHalsin: Patience. I can't just snap my fingers... but I know where the solution almost certainly lies.\nHalsin: I overheard that the cultists are sending all of their captives to Moonrise Towers.\nHalsin: Innocents go in, True Souls come out. Given that all of these True Souls are infected, it has to be the source of this magic.\nHalsin: If you want to find a cure, you must head there and discover how the tadpoles are being manipulated.\nPlayer: You seem to know a lot about this. Will you come with me to Moonrise?\nHalsin: I wish I could, but there's still work I've yet to finish - blood I've yet to spill.\nHalsin: I've no right to ask more of you... but if you could help me, I'd be free to join your journey to Moonrise.\nHalsin: I cannot allow these butchers to threaten my grove. The natural order must be protected.\nPlayer: All right. How do I help?\nHalsin: My thanks. If you prevail, I'll owe you the debt of a lifetime.\nHalsin: Rare is the beast that survives decapitation. Help me eliminate the drow Minthara, the hobgoblin Dror Ragzlin, and that perversion of a priestess, Gut.\nHalsin: They are the ones holding these parasites together. Remove them and nature will cure itself.\nPlayer: You are aware you're asking me to kill a drow?\nHalsin: You drow relish turning on your own, if there's something to be gained. Don't pretend otherwise.\nPlayer: There's no pretence in not wanting to play the assassin. You're on your own.",

The answer is much simpler than that:\nWyll: Time.\nWyll: Time is so gods-damned greedy. It can never give, only take. My eternal soul is at its mercy.\nWyll: It builds mountains and deserts, only to tear them asunder. It fells armies, it conquers kings, queens - even gods.\nWyll: We blink, and we're gone.

Let me tell you what I know.\nHalsin: I've been studying these parasites for a while now. Ever since I discovered these so-called True Souls are infected with them.\nHalsin: Someone is using very powerful magic to modify these tadpoles. They are using them to exert control over the infected.\nHalsin: I'm sorry to say, I can't undo that magic, which means I can't cure you. But that doesn't mean I can't help.\nHalsin: I didn't find what I came here for - a way to remove the tadpoles - but I found the next best thing. I found out where they come from.\nHalsin: That must be where these enchantments are placed on them, and it's where you'll find your cure.\nPlayer: How did you come to study mind flayer parasites?\nHalsin: A drow forced me to defend myself. Afterwards, I was able to study the parasite that slithered out of the corpse, see what drives these 'True Souls'.\nHalsin: I had no idea anyone beyond their ranks was infected. You have my sincere sympathies.\nPlayer: What should I do?\nHalsin: I overheard that the cultists are sending all of their captives to Moonrise Towers.\nHalsin: Innocents go in, True Souls come out. Given that all of these True Souls are infected, it has to be the source of this magic.\nHalsin: If you want to find a cure, you must head there and discover how the tadpoles are being manipulated.\nPlayer: You seem to know a lot about this. Will you come with me to Moonrise?\nHalsin: I wish I could, but there's still work I've yet to finish - blood I've yet to spill.\nHalsin: I've no right to ask more of you... but if you could help me, I'd be free to join your journey to Moonrise.\nHalsin: I cannot allow these butchers to threaten my grove. The natural order must be protected.\nPlayer: Look around you - there's no order anymore. Only chaos.\nHalsin: Chaos is welcome, in doses; it helps keep balance. But this is too much - this is unnatural.\nHalsin: Help me kill the leaders of this horde, save my grove. Then I will help you.\n\nHalsin: Three deaths could win us peace: the drow Minthara, the hobgoblin Dror Ragzlin, and that perversion of a priestess, Gut.\nHalsin: They are the ones holding these parasites together. Remove them and nature will cure itself.\nPlayer: The grove isn't my problem. I have to concentrate on saving myself.",

Her hands are in a prayer position and she's chanting softly as the moonlight dances around her. She exhales, then inhales and breaths in tendrils of shadow, absorbing them. She swallows, then begins hacking coughing. The moonlight dissipates. She quickly goes from seeming like a divine spirit to a normal young woman.\nIsobel: I didn't realise I had an audience.\nFist Marcus: Isobel. This is -\nIsobel: A Sharran.\nNarrator: *Isobel. The same name as Ketheric Thorm's daughter - the one whose sarcophagus you found empty in the family mausoleum.*\nPlayer: Push your Urges down.\nPlayer: You can tell my allegiance from a look?\nIsobel: It's an aura. Or a lack of one, really.\nIsobel: Frankly, I'm surprised you're willing to help us. Your kind aren't known for their decency - particularly when a Sharran curse is our greatest obstacle.\nIsobel: But if you are who I think you are, I'd be a fool to reject your help. The True Soul with... well, a soul. Imagine.\nPlayer: I won't be spoken to like that by a Selûnite.\nIsobel: We've both got a bitter pill to swallow. When this is all over, we can spit it back out.\nIsobel: You'll be needing the protection spell, I presume?\nIsobel: Oh - aren't you looking for a protection spell?\nPlayer: I am already protected. My Lady shields me from the curse.\nIsobel: For now, perhaps. But Shar can be fickle, and her love can prove fleeting. Do not turn your back on an advantage you may need... even a Selûnite one.\nIsobel: If nothing else, it can aid any companions who travel with you - somehow I doubt Shar's largesse was extended to them.\nPlayer: Silently petition Lady Shar for guidance.\nNarrator: *She offers you nothing.*\nIsobel: Well! If the Moonmaiden didn't strike me dead for blessing you, she must rather approve of this little alliance.\nIsobel: This will block the lesser effects of the shadow curse, allowing you to traverse the darkness outside... should Shar's own protection falter, that is.\nIsobel: Curious. Surely the Nightsinger could have shielded all her followers, and made this place her domain long ago... yet she only acts now, and aids you alone. I wonder why.\nPlayer: The Dark Lady's works aren't for me to question.\nIsobel: Mustn't question the great shadow mother, must we?\nIsobel: I'll stop needling you, though.

Mostly full of tieflin's, but them intruders you're after were hidin' out there!\nNightwarden Minthara: I presume you dealt with my prey, and massacred the rest?\nSazza: Ah... well, the thing about that is... they sorta massacred us.\nSazza: This mug helped me escape though. I say we stick a few holes in them... show how grateful we are.\n\nNarrator: *You feel a cold hand caress your mind as the drow appraises you.*\nNightwarden Minthara: Oh dear. Your prisoner is one of the Absolute's favourites, Sazza. A True Soul.\nSazza: Nah. Can't be... they woz in the grove, hangin' around with the tieflin's.\nNightwarden Minthara: Undercover, no doubt. Carrying out the Absolute's will. Oh, Sazza - you have made a grave error.\nNightwarden Minthara: And it will be your last. My spiders are hungry, little one...\nNightwarden Minthara: ...but before they feast, tell me where that grove is, and I may yet spare your life.\nSazza: It's past the bridge, to the east! Big ol' gate, covered in ivy! Don't hurt me, mistress. Please!\nNightwarden Minthara: I will not hurt you. My spiders will have that pleasure.\nSazza: No! I mucked up, I'm sorry! But I didn't know who they woz... they didn't tell me nothin'!\nPlayer: She's telling the truth. She didn't know.\nSazza: I told ya! I was tryin' to follow orders best I could!\nNightwarden Minthara: Silence, wretch. And remember - you owe your miserable life to this one.\nSazza: I won't cause any more trouble - I swears it.\nNightwarden Minthara: Through sheer luck, that pathetic worm has brought me the information I need.\nNightwarden Minthara: And it seems that the inhabitants of the grove trust you - we can use that against them.\nNightwarden Minthara: You have a part to play in this slaughter.\nNightwarden Minthara: Return to the grove. When my raiding party approaches, throw open the gate and signal me.\nNarrator: *The fate of the grove's inhabitants hangs in the balance.*\nNarrator: *Killing the drow here would spare them, but it might be better to face her warband at the grove itself, on familiar ground.*\nNarrator: *On the other hand, participating in the slaughter as she asks may be the perfect way to earn her trust, and access to the cult's inner circle.*\nPlayer: I'll get it done.",

Legend has it it's stood since the Age of Dawn.\nWyll: I used to come here and climb it when father's eye was turned elsewhere - daydream of the stories it might tell, if I listened close enough.\nWyll: The dragon lords sparking the skies above it. The moon elves first plucking the strings of the Weave.\nWyll: Standing here, I feel like I can see into forever.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: The camera moves from the two of you and outwards. A vista of stunning and quiet beauty.\nPlayer: I'm not sure I can see into forever. But it's still a nice view.\nWyll: My favourite in all of the Coast. All of Faerûn, even. Not even the Sea of Stars could rival its magnificence -\nWyll: Nor could it rival yours.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Wyll kneels to the ground. He takes an acorn and holds it in the palm of his hands, but keeps them close to his body.\nWyll: My mother always said the Wilden Oak's acorns held just a touch of wishing magic.\nWyll: If that be so, then may my greatest wish come true tonight:\nWyll: I love you.

Her hands are in a prayer position and she's chanting softly as the moonlight dances around her. She exhales, then inhales and breaths in tendrils of shadow, absorbing them. She swallows, then begins hacking coughing. The moonlight dissipates. She quickly goes from seeming like a divine spirit to a normal young woman.\nIsobel: I didn't realise I had an audience.\nFist Marcus: Isobel. This is -\nIsobel: A Sharran.\nNarrator: *Isobel. The same name as Ketheric Thorm's daughter - the one whose sarcophagus you found empty in the family mausoleum.*\nPlayer: Push your Urges down.\nPlayer: Isobel - Isobel Thorm?\nIsobel: An unfortunate coincidence. I hope never to meet the wicked man who haemorrhaged shadows over this peaceful village. I've heard you might be the person to stop him.\nIsobel: A True Soul with a soul. Imagine.\nIsobel: But if you are who I think you are, I'd be a fool to reject your help. The True Soul with... well, a soul. Imagine.\nPlayer: I may have the parasite of a True Soul, but not the mind of one.\nIsobel: And that's what makes you essential.\nIsobel: You'll be needing the protection spell, I presume?\nIsobel: Oh - aren't you looking for a protection spell?\nPlayer: I am already protected. My Lady shields me from the curse.\nIsobel: For now, perhaps. But Shar can be fickle, and her love can prove fleeting. Do not turn your back on an advantage you may need... even a Selûnite one.\nIsobel: If nothing else, it can aid any companions who travel with you - somehow I doubt Shar's largesse was extended to them.\nPlayer: Ngh... it hurts...\nIsobel: Well! If the Moonmaiden didn't strike me dead for blessing you, she must rather approve of this little alliance.\nIsobel: This will block the lesser effects of the shadow curse, allowing you to traverse the darkness outside... should Shar's own protection falter, that is.\nIsobel: Curious. Surely the Nightsinger could have shielded all her followers, and made this place her domain long ago... yet she only acts now, and aids you alone. I wonder why.\nPlayer: The Dark Lady's works aren't for me to question.\nIsobel: Mustn't question the great shadow mother, must we?\nIsobel: I'll stop needling you, though. You have more important things to do, after all.\nPlayer: I've already been to Moonrise, but I have more work to do indeed.\nIsobel: I imagine so, if Jaheira hasn't gone tearing off into the night.\nPlayer: You're coming with me, cleric.",

Her hands are in a prayer position and she's chanting softly as the moonlight dances around her. She exhales, then inhales and breaths in tendrils of shadow, absorbing them. She swallows, then begins hacking coughing. The moonlight dissipates. She quickly goes from seeming like a divine spirit to a normal young woman.\nIsobel: I didn't realise I had an audience.\nFist Marcus: Isobel. This is -\nIsobel: A Sharran.\nNarrator: *Isobel. The same name as Ketheric Thorm's daughter - the one whose sarcophagus you found empty in the family mausoleum.*\nPlayer: Push your Urges down.\nPlayer: You can tell my allegiance from a look?\nIsobel: It's an aura. Or a lack of one, really.\nIsobel: Frankly, I'm surprised you're willing to help us. Your kind aren't known for their decency - particularly when a Sharran curse is our greatest obstacle.\nIsobel: But if you are who I think you are, I'd be a fool to reject your help. The True Soul with... well, a soul. Imagine.\nPlayer: You seem to have a lot to say about my allegiance. Can we focus on the task at hand?\nIsobel: I suppose that would be wise. We have a common enemy, after all: Ketheric Thorm.\nIsobel: You'll be needing the protection spell, I presume?\nIsobel: Oh - aren't you looking for a protection spell?\nPlayer: I need nothing from a Selûnite.\nIsobel: But any others who travel with you may not agree. Do it for them at least - you will need all the help you can get out there.\nPlayer: Ngh... it hurts...\nIsobel: Well! If the Moonmaiden didn't strike me dead for blessing you, she must rather approve of this little alliance.\nIsobel: This will block the lesser effects of the shadow curse, allowing you to traverse the darkness outside... should Shar's own protection falter, that is.\nIsobel: Curious. Surely the Nightsinger could have shielded all her followers, and made this place her domain long ago... yet she only acts now, and aids you alone. I wonder why.\nPlayer: I don't know what to make of it myself.\nIsobel: I suppose Shar is nothing if not mysterious.\nIsobel: I'll stop needling you, though. You have more important things to do, after all.\nPlayer: You're coming with me, cleric.",

The answer is much simpler than that:\nWyll: Time.\nWyll: Time is so gods-damned greedy. It can never give, only take. My eternal soul is at its mercy.\nWyll: It builds mountains and deserts, only to tear them asunder. It fells armies, it conquers kings, queens - even gods.\nWyll: We blink, and we're gone.

It is a beautiful night; the moon and stars shine bright.\nWyll: The Wilden Oak. Legend has it it's stood since the Age of Dawn.\nWyll: I used to come here and climb it when father's eye was turned elsewhere - daydream of the stories it might tell, if I listened close enough.\nWyll: The dragon lords sparking the skies above it. The moon elves first plucking the strings of the Weave.\nWyll: Standing here, I feel like I can see into forever.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: The camera moves from the two of you and outwards.

He takes an acorn and holds it in the palm of his hands, but keeps them close to his body.\nWyll: My mother always said the Wilden Oak's acorns held just a touch of wishing magic.\nWyll: If that be so, then may my greatest wish come true tonight:\nWyll: I love you.

Helping him could be just what you need to gain access to the man himself.*\nPlayer: What are the properties of this relic, magical or otherwise? So I can be of better assistance, of course.\nPlayer: I need more to go on. Why is this relic so important? What does it do?\nBalthazar: Telling you will not make the task any less perilous. Just obey, and use your ignorance as a shield. You should be adept at that already.\nBalthazar: The Nightsong lends the General his strength, his invulnerability. It must be recovered, before his enemies attempt to exploit it.\nPlayer: You need my help?\nBalthazar: I do not need you, or your help. But you are here in spite of that, so I may as well make use of you.\nBalthazar: The Nightsong is close, but the way is barred and Shar's dead are... uncooperative. Clear the path for me - by blade, cunning, or whatever it takes.\nBalthazar: I will remain here until you have succeeded, or fallen.\nShadowheart: I'd trust this gasbag about as far as I can throw him - which isn't far. But perhaps better to play along, for now.\nPlayer: For jobs like this it's good form to provide your operatives some extra resources.\nBalthazar: Fine. I will assign Flesh to aid you on your way. Ring this bell...\nBalthazar: ...Hmm. Misplaced, it seems. You will be capable enough without it.\nPlayer: I'll see what I can do.",

Kagha - their new First Druid - won't see me.\nZevlor: You, though... I know it's not your business, but she owes you for saving this place.\nZevlor: Perhaps you could persuade her.

Quiet as a mouse.\nPlayer: Where will I find my contract?\nGROUP_Act3_LOW_HouseOfHope_Hope: THE SAME PLACE YOU'LL FIND YOUR SORRY LITTLE SOUL WHEN RAPHAEL RIPS IT OUT\nGROUP_Act3_LOW_HouseOfHope_Hope: The paper cage for your soul. Such a tiny thing, but it's one of his favourites.\nGROUP_Act3_LOW_HouseOfHope_Hope: In the Archive. Down the corridor, past the debtors. OH! The debtors. They won't like you.\nGROUP_Act3_LOW_HouseOfHope_Hope: But I like you. I know I do, I think I do, I hope I do. I just need to ask one question, and I'll know for sure.\nPlayer: No. I'm not telling you anything.",

Elturel had no place for tieflings after the Descent.\nNarrator: *You remember it. Elturel and all its citizens were dragged into Avernus - then back out again.*\nPlayer: Found sanctuary here, did you?\nZevlor: So I hoped. But we've lost so many already - and more will die if we're forced out again.\nZevlor: We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: What brought you here?\nZevlor: We're refugees from Elturel - we took shelter here after goblins and gnolls attacked us on the road.\nZevlor: We were bound for Baldur's Gate, and it was too late to turn back. Elturel had no place for tieflings after the Descent.\nPlayer: 'The Descent'? What is that?\nZevlor: I'm surprised you haven't heard of it.\nZevlor: The High Overseer - our grand protector - signed a pact with devils. It dragged Elturel straight to Hell.\nZevlor: Lucky for us, a group of adventurers found a way to bring the city back.\nZevlor: Afterwards, people looked at us and just saw 'devilkin'. No different from the druids here, really.\nZevlor: We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: Leave.",

One of our most reliable contractors, though unfortunately this particular request was too much even for her.\nHavkelaag: I believe she quite lost her senses over the task. She came here insisting I purchase an owlbear egg from her, of all things.\nHavkelaag: I don't suppose you've stumbled across any githyanki eggs during your travels? The Society will compensate you for any we purchase, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nHavkelaag: Would you consider parting with it? The Society's coffers are deep enough to cover any expenses accrued in its retrieval, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: Chk. Don't you dare consider it.\nPlayer: What are you going to do with it?\nHavkelaag: Study it, of course. The githyanki have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months.\nHavkelaag: You are no doubt aware that citizens of the Underdark are held in great suspicion by those who live above ground. Many believe us to be 'evil'.\nHavkelaag: The githyanki face similar prejudice, but I believe, if hatched in a less violent, more intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome its evil predispositions.\nHavkelaag: I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: So the child inside will be experimented on?\nHavkelaag: Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach:\nHavkelaag: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue.\nHavkelaag: Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: So you, too, follow the teachings of Bahamut. Why him?\nHavkelaag: In my years of study, they're the closest I've found to moral perfection. Only under such rigorous 'goodness' will the subject stand a chance of being cured.\nHavkelaag: My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: An experiment like this will only confirm the surface dwellers' suspicion of us.\nHavkelaag: Of course it won't. If anything, it will do quite the opposite. The academic institutions up here will finally be forced to take us seriously.\nHavkelaag: Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg?

You walk on the path of ascension.\nVlaakith: Extend your fealty one step further, and you will be rewarded beyond your mortal reckoning.\nVlaakith: The Astral Prism - it is corrupted.\nCh'r'ai W'wargaz: I shall cleanse it for you, my queen. Tell me how.\nInternalNodeContext: He's not altogether sure why this task is falling to the player and not to him, but also doesn't want to challenge his queen's motivations.\nVlaakith: SILENCE, W'wargaz.\nVlaakith: There is someone inside. Their mind is warped, broken - a blight.\nVlaakith: They are an agent of the Grand Design. Sent to sabotage the Astral Prism - our last defence against the return of the Illithid Empire.\nVlaakith: As long as they live, the Prism is compromised.\nVlaakith: Find the one inside and destroy them. Be aware - they are not alone, and they will appeal to your trust. They are not to be believed.\nPlayer: The god-queen of my people cannot kill someone herself?\nVlaakith: Perhaps I misheard. You would not speak ill of a god. Would you?\nPlayer: I spoke too hastily - please forgive me.",

Do this -\nVlaakith: - and ascend.\nLae'zel: Ascension? My queen. An honour gained, a burden borne.\nLae'zel: You must accept. Refuse, and you will know my fury.\nVlaakith: Not merely great, Lae'zel. Eternal.\nPlayer: I can't do that.

I worshipped that woman.\nPlayer: So it's personal? Good - let's take her down.\nNightwarden Minthara: You make it sound so simple.

Pure love. Total power.\nNightwarden Minthara: Orin was by my side. She told me that god had chosen me to be a True Soul. Blessed and adored.\nNightwarden Minthara: Now I know that those memories are lies.\nNightwarden Minthara: There was no god. Orin held me down in a cocoon of flesh, while a mind flayer forced a parasite into my brain. And she laughed at my fear.\nNightwarden Minthara: I will find her, I will murder her. And I will smile.\nPlayer: We'll be heroes - the saviours of Baldur's Gate.\nNightwarden Minthara: Let them think that. There is a short path from saviour to ruler - a short and bloody path. I know it well, and we will walk it together.\nNightwarden Minthara: But Baldur's Gate is a mere bauble. We have the chance to seize something much greater. Surely you see it?\nNightwarden Minthara: In killing Ketheric, we fractured the cult's leadership. When we break the other Chosen and claim their Netherstones, we can take control.\nPlayer: A bold gamble. How can you be sure it's possible?\nNightwarden Minthara: I would have thought this entire conspiracy of gods and monsters to be impossible if I had not seen it for myself.\nNightwarden Minthara: We may fail, but we must try.\nNightwarden Minthara: The power of the enslaved elder brain could reshape the world. We could reshape the world.\nPlayer: The future you propose is shaped by violence. I'd prefer to find another way.\nNightwarden Minthara: There is violence in your future regardless. With me, you can at least be sure the violence will lead to glory.\nNightwarden Minthara: You are not stupid. When we reach Baldur's Gate and face the other Chosen, you will see that my way is the right one.\nPlayer: Maybe I'll change your mind.\nNightwarden Minthara: The elder brain is the only thing that has ever managed to change my mind. You're welcome to try.\nNightwarden Minthara: We are bound, then, to travel together, even if we do not yet agree on our ultimate purpose.\nNightwarden Minthara: There is yet one thing about you that troubles me, though. Something I need you to explain.\nNightwarden Minthara: When we killed the tieflings, at the grove, I was not in control of my actions. You do not have that excuse. So I ask you - why? Why kill them?\nPlayer: I enjoy killing.",

It must be recovered, before his enemies attempt to exploit it.\nPlayer: You need my help?\nBalthazar: I do not need you, or your help.

But they only serve one man.\nWulbren Bongle: When he becomes Grand Duke, it will only get worse. Laws will change, freedoms will vanish, and soon you'll be accused and sentenced before you've even committed a crime.\nWulbren Bongle: And the fucking Gondians are to blame for all of it.\nPlayer: Why put the blame on the Gondians?\nWulbren Bongle: They invented the Steel Watchers. And they're building an army of them.\nWulbren Bongle: They've always been happy to provide their technology to despots in exchange for a stipend and the freedom to work in peace.\nWulbren Bongle: They would have licked Sarevok's boots given the chance, and now they'll kiss Gortash's ring while the city screams.\nWulbren Bongle: I had a plan to put a stop to them. But the way things are now, if we stick our heads above ground, the Watchers are on us like flies on shit.\nPlayer: I've already run foul of the Watchers myself.\nWulbren Bongle: And yet here you are, all in one piece.

But we're more than equal to them - there's nothing they can build that the Ironhands can't tear down.\nWulbren Bongle: I've built something unique for just that purpose.\nWulbren Bongle: A runepowder bomb - first of its kind. Fifty wizards high on the Weave couldn't summon this kind of firepower.\nWulbren Bongle: Get the bomb inside the Gondian facility, and - boom. Problem solved.\nBarcus Wroot: Wulbren, please. This is too far! Everyone in the foundry would be killed.\nWulbren Bongle: Quiet, Barcus. The adults are talking.\nPlayer: Killing innocents won't right this wrong, Wulbren.\nWulbren Bongle: Innocents. You have no idea what you're talking about.\nWulbren Bongle: The Gondians picked their side the minute they took orders from Gortash.\nWulbren Bongle: If they had any courage, they'd have refused him and died like heroes, spitting in his face.\nWulbren Bongle: Now they'll die like the dogs they are.\nPlayer: This is too messy for me - I'm out.",

You feel your patron giggle from afar - it's fey magic.*\nPlayer: Is this extra security because of the priest who was murdered?\nKlaus: Oh, more than him got the knife. They say the Absolute's cronies have been busy chopping people up like it's going out of style.\nKlaus: They won't go near us, of course - Lucretious, Bringer of Night, protects us.\nKlaus: And even the Absolute knows better than to tangle with a necromancer.\nKlaus: Benji here checks all our patrons to make sure none of you are vicious murderers. Can't be too careful!\nKlaus: But enough of this - the circus is a place of joy and distraction! So come inside and forget your worries.\nPlayer: All right - I'd like to enter the circus.\nKlaus: Not a problem, dear patron! Benji just has to check if you're a vicious murderer. Benji!\nBenji: *Sniff.* Huh. *Sniff.* *SNIFF.*\nBenji: Urgh. Smells like a MUD FART.\nKlaus: So, doesn't know the meaning of the word soap? Hmm. I don't fancy subjecting our patrons to such a stink.\nKlaus: I'm afraid you'll have to move along - no circus for you.\nKlaus: That's a first. Usually I'd allow you in, but in these times I can take no chances. Move along - no circus for you.\nNarrator: *You feel your patron bristle with a thousand briars at the rejection. It places some barbed words on your tongue - a weapon, should you need it.*\nPlayer: Let me in, or I snap you in two.",

Ring this bell...\nBalthazar: ...and he will come.\nBalthazar: My brother is no intellectual powerhouse, but he is strong, loyal and punctual. Should a fight turn against you, remember the bell.\nPlayer: Keep it - this is your problem, not mine.\nBalthazar: This is not a problem - it is an opportunity.

I worshipped that woman.\nPlayer: So it's personal? Good - let's take her down.\nNightwarden Minthara: You make it sound so simple. She is the Chosen of Bhaal, Lord of Murder, and one of the cult's founders.\nNightwarden Minthara: Indeed, she is the one who indoctrinated me with the Absolute's lies.\nPlayer: What can you tell me about Orin?\nNightwarden Minthara: She is fierce, vicious, and cruel. In those respects, we are alike - but she is dangerously unpredictable.\nNightwarden Minthara: If there is a way to turn this design toward slaughter rather than control, she will take it.\nNightwarden Minthara: She is the one who brought me to Moonrise, and into the presence of her so-called god - the Absolute.\nNightwarden Minthara: Now I know that those memories are lies.\nNightwarden Minthara: There was no god. Orin held me down in a cocoon of flesh, while a mind flayer forced a parasite into my brain. And she laughed at my fear.\nNightwarden Minthara: I will find her, I will murder her. And I will smile.\nPlayer: We'll be heroes - the saviours of Baldur's Gate.\nNightwarden Minthara: Let them think that. There is a short path from saviour to ruler - a short and bloody path. I know it well, and we will walk it together.\nNightwarden Minthara: But Baldur's Gate is a mere bauble. We have the chance to seize something much greater. Surely you see it?\nNightwarden Minthara: In killing Ketheric, we fractured the cult's leadership. When we break the other Chosen and claim their Netherstones, we can take control.\nPlayer: Madness. We need to eradicate the cult and the elder brain.\nNightwarden Minthara: Madness would be to let the Absolute's potential go to waste.\nNightwarden Minthara: The power of the enslaved elder brain could reshape the world.

When we reach Baldur's Gate and face the other Chosen, you will see that my way is the right one.\nPlayer: Maybe I'll change your mind.\nNightwarden Minthara: The elder brain is the only thing that has ever managed to change my mind. You're welcome to try.\nNightwarden Minthara: We are bound, then, to travel together, even if we do not yet agree on our ultimate purpose.\nNightwarden Minthara: There is yet one thing about you that troubles me, though.

He said I was gonna be punished, that you'd be the judge. But I didn't mean to hurt anyone!\nPlayer: You 'didn't mean' to kill your friends? How laughable.\nGale: Come now - you're hardly in position to cast judgement on that score, are you?\nMadeline: I said it didn't mean nothin', that Ben n' Marc were just drunk n' whining.\nMadeline: The Dark Justiciar promised she was gonna chat with 'em. She promised.\nPlayer: What did the Dark Justiciar actually do to your friends?\nMadeline: She gave 'em a dagger each, and told 'em to press it against their stomachs.\nMadeline: On the count of three, to 'start stabbin', and not to stop 'til she said so.\nMadeline: She never said stop. I'd do anything to take it back. Anything.\nPlayer: Stab yourself. Rip your stomach open. Feel the pain of your friends - only then will you be free.\nPlayer: Anything? Then hurt yourself as Ben and Marc did - stab yourself.\nMadeline: Like... this?\nNodeContext: Madeline draws a blade from behind her and holds it in front of her stomach, blade pointed towards her stomach. She is utterly terrified (pose like seppuku)\nPlayer: Start stabbing, and don't stop until I say so.\nMadeline: Ah! I'm sorry.\nNodeContext: Ah! is a noise of pain as she stabs herself in the stomach and then pulls out the knife. 'I'm sorry' is said in clear pain.\nMadeline: Argh. I'm so sorry.\nNodeContext: stabs herself again on 'Argh', noise of pain. I'm so so sorry is half crying as she's in agony.\nPlayer: Did I say stop? Drive the knife in deeper.",

You know what's at stake here, I take it?\nPlayer: Z'rell said Ketheric wants you to find a relic. That's all I know.\nPlayer: As you mention serving Ketheric, he sent you to find a relic, no?\nBalthazar: General Thorm to you. But yes, recovering the relic is the crux of it. He commands, and I, his humble servant, fulfil that command.\nBalthazar: While you, an infinitely more humble servant, fulfil my command. I will put you to work - as a scout.\nNarrator: *This necromancer has Ketheric's trust. Helping him could be just what you need to gain access to the man himself.*\nPlayer: What are the properties of this relic, magical or otherwise? So I can be of better assistance, of course.\nPlayer: I need more to go on. Why is this relic so important? What does it do?\nBalthazar: Fine, if it'll spare me your bleating. The relic lends the General his strength, his invulnerability. It must be recovered, before his enemies attempt to exploit it.\nBalthazar: The Nightsong lends the General his strength, his invulnerability. It must be recovered, before his enemies attempt to exploit it.\nPlayer: Sounds like you've good reason to be proud of the Nightsong - tell me more.\nBalthazar: And spoil the surprise? I think not.

When you see for yourself, you will understand.\nPlayer: What do you need me to do?\nBalthazar: I do not need you, or your help. But you are here in spite of that, so I may as well make use of you.\nBalthazar: The relic is close, but the way is barred and Shar's dead are... uncooperative. Clear the path for me - by blade, cunning, or whatever it takes.\nBalthazar: I will remain here until you have succeeded, or fallen.\nShadowheart: I'd trust this gasbag about as far as I can throw him - which isn't far. But perhaps better to play along, for now.\nPlayer: This sounds like your problem, not mine.\nPlayer: Keep it - this is your problem, not mine.\nBalthazar: This is not a problem - it is an opportunity.

The githyanki have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months.\nHavkelaag: You yourself have no doubt experienced the prejudice of those who assume that, as beings of the Underdark, we are inherently evil.\nHavkelaag: The githyanki face similar prejudice, but I believe, if hatched in a less violent, more intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome its evil predispositions.\nHavkelaag: I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: What does this 'intellectually stimulating' upbringing look like?\nHavkelaag: In the literal sense, I will need to induce the egg to hatch via the application of certain currents to the creature inside.\nHavkelaag: Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach:\nHavkelaag: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue.\nHavkelaag: Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: You'd better get cracking, then. Here's the egg.\nPlayer: Sell the egg.\nHavkelaag: Ah.

He and I have history.\nJaheira: You were the one who rescued those the Absolute had imprisoned. You were courageous to brave the depths of Ketheric's stronghold.\nJaheira: I suppose you know about Ketheric, then. His invincibility. That we'll never cleanse this place until he's made to bleed.\nJaheira: We met him on the road here - commanding an army of the Absolute, intent on destroying Baldur's Gate. I put an arrow through his eye myself, only to watch him pluck it out like a splinter.\nJaheira: He healed right in front of me, and chased us into the shadows. Things looked hopeless, but experience has taught me that no matter how bleak things look, there's always hope.\nJaheira: You are that hope.\nPlayer: What do you have in mind?\nJaheira: Protected by your artefact, you can infiltrate his forces at Moonrise Towers, posing as a True Soul.\nJaheira: Find out what it is that makes him invincible so we can strip him of his advantage.\nJaheira: Once Ketheric is without his shield, the sword: together we assault his tower, and put a final end to this blight.\nPlayer: There's something you should know - Marcus, the Flaming Fist upstairs, is a True Soul. He wants to kidnap Isobel.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Jaheir takes the glass from the table.\nJaheira: This place is crawling with Harpers.

Marcus is a danger to you all.\nJaheira: A Harper's gaze can only be turned by proof. By the looks of it, a tall tale is all you have to offer.\nJaheira: But you're far from the most eccentric drinking companion I've had. I'd like to know more.

You are no sister, but that matters none. Every student is welcome.\nPlayer: I don't wish to study, only to lift the curse on this land.\nMalus Thorm: A curse? Nay, a cure that leads to the very pinnacle of being:\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence.

See how painfully present you remain...\nMalus Thorm: We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: Their blades are uneven.

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon’s voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar.\nMalus Thorm: See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy.\nMalus Thorm: Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace.\nMalus Thorm: Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver.\nMalus Thorm: Come. Step forward. I can see the love of Shar darken your eyes. Be welcome.\nPlayer: May Shar guide your blessing hands.\nMalus Thorm: And the rough vessels that are yours.\nMalus Thorm: Tell me, what is the guiding principle of the goddess?\nPlayer: Forgetfulness.\nMalus Thorm: I profess there is another more profound.\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly.\nMalus Thorm: It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nShadowheart: A stinging truth - but a truth nonetheless.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being?\nMalus Thorm: If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: But you: look how the succour of Shar eludes you. See how painfully present you remain...\nMalus Thorm: We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: The goddess has greater plans for me than to submit to your scalpels.\nMalus Thorm: Another absence is your fate? But if you are not here to be cured, how will my sisters learn?\nMalus Thorm: Their incisions are, as yet, still streaked with imprecision - that much I must concede.\nMalus Thorm: How to steady their hands, I wonder.\nPlayer: 'Only with sacrifice is mastery gained.' For the sisters to learn, you must submit.\nMalus Thorm: Yes. Submit I must, into the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nMalus Thorm: I see now. By example I must edify and quell the light that blinds us.",

The surgeon’s voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar.\nMalus Thorm: See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy.\nMalus Thorm: Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace.\nMalus Thorm: Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver.\nMalus Thorm: Come. Step forward. I can see the love of Shar darken your eyes. Be welcome.\nPlayer: May Shar guide your blessing hands.\nMalus Thorm: And the rough vessels that are yours.\nMalus Thorm: Tell me, what is the guiding principle of the goddess?\nPlayer: Darkness.\nMalus Thorm: I profess there is another more profound.\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly.\nMalus Thorm: It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nLae'zel: Only a beast of a man toys with his victim. Entertaining, if not efficient.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being?\nMalus Thorm: If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: But you: look how the succour of Shar eludes even you, one who walks faithfully in her shadow. See how painfully present you remain...\nMalus Thorm: We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: The goddess has greater plans for me than to submit to your scalpels.\nMalus Thorm: Another absence is your fate? But if you are not here to be cured, how will my sisters learn?\nMalus Thorm: Their incisions are, as yet, still streaked with imprecision - that much I must concede.\nMalus Thorm: How to steady their hands, I wonder.\nPlayer: Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\nMalus Thorm: Yes... For are we not all in need of a cure?\nMalus Thorm: The scalpel does not discriminate. Let each and every one of you partake in its soothing journey.\nMalus Thorm: Absence, sisters. Acquaint yourselves.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) Screaming and slashing, the sisters brutally murder each other.\nMalus Thorm: It is a proud moment when one sees one's teachings so lovingly taken to heart.\nMalus Thorm: You are to be commended for their graduation - rewarded with the promised cure.\nMalus Thorm: Come, I will acquaint you with the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nPlayer: I would rather acquaint myself - if you show me how.\nMalus Thorm: Your diligence is exemplary. Very well: your own scalpel you will be.",

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon’s voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar.\nMalus Thorm: See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy.\nMalus Thorm: Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace.\nMalus Thorm: Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver.\nMalus Thorm: Come. Step forward. You are no sister, but that matters none. Every student is welcome.\nPlayer: You will stop this sick spectacle at once.\nMalus Thorm: Sick. Quite. But on the cusp of a cure:\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly.\nMalus Thorm: It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nWyll: Hells. Only a monster would inflict misery and call it medicine.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being?\nMalus Thorm: If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: You are well on your way. But one white orb disfigures you still. Let us finish the cure.\nMalus Thorm: We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: The sisters aren't ready. They'll make me sick instead of curing me.\nMalus Thorm: Their incisions are, as yet, still streaked with imprecision - that much I must concede.\nMalus Thorm: How to steady their hands, I wonder.\nPlayer: Practice - that's how I got good with a blade. They should spar each other.\nPlayer: Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\nMalus Thorm: Yes... For are we not all in need of a cure?\nMalus Thorm: The scalpel does not discriminate. Let each and every one of you partake in its soothing journey.\nMalus Thorm: Absence, sisters. Acquaint yourselves.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) Screaming and slashing, the sisters brutally murder each other.\nMalus Thorm: It is a proud moment when one sees one's teachings so lovingly taken to heart.\nMalus Thorm: You are to be commended for their graduation - rewarded with the promised cure.\nMalus Thorm: Come, I will acquaint you with the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nPlayer: I would rather acquaint myself - if you show me how.\nMalus Thorm: Your diligence is exemplary.

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon’s voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar.\nMalus Thorm: See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy.\nMalus Thorm: Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace.\nMalus Thorm: Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver.\nMalus Thorm: Come. Step forward. You are no sister, but that matters none. Every student is welcome.\nPlayer: What wrong has this man done to deserve such torture?\nMalus Thorm: Behold, sisters, the very face of ignorance - one who mistakes tenderness for torture.\nMalus Thorm: Go on. Acquaint the face of ignorance with the true object of our studies.\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly.\nMalus Thorm: It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nLae'zel: Only a beast of a man toys with his victim. Entertaining, if not efficient.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being?\nMalus Thorm: If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: But you: look how the succour of Shar eludes you. See how painfully present you remain...\nMalus Thorm: We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: The sisters aren't ready. They'll make me sick instead of curing me.\nMalus Thorm: Their incisions are, as yet, still streaked with imprecision - that much I must concede.\nMalus Thorm: How to steady their hands, I wonder.\nPlayer: Practice - that's how I got good with a blade. They should spar each other.\nPlayer: Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\nMalus Thorm: Yes... For are we not all in need of a cure?\nMalus Thorm: The scalpel does not discriminate. Let each and every one of you partake in its soothing journey.\nMalus Thorm: Absence, sisters. Acquaint yourselves.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) Screaming and slashing, the sisters brutally murder each other.\nMalus Thorm: It is a proud moment when one sees one's teachings so lovingly taken to heart.\nMalus Thorm: You are to be commended for their graduation - rewarded with the promised cure.\nMalus Thorm: Come, I will acquaint you with the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nPlayer: I am not worthy! Please, show me how a master works - I would be honoured.\nPlayer: I would rather acquaint myself - if you show me how.\nMalus Thorm: Your diligence is exemplary.

Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy.\nMalus Thorm: Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision.

See how painfully present you remain...\nMalus Thorm: We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: The sisters aren't ready.

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon’s voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar.\nMalus Thorm: See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy.\nMalus Thorm: Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace.\nMalus Thorm: Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver.\nMalus Thorm: Come. Step forward. I can see the love of Shar darken your eyes. Be welcome.\nPlayer: What lesson are you teaching these sisters?\nMalus Thorm: The crux of our worship.\nMalus Thorm: Tell me, what is the guiding principle of the goddess?\nPlayer: Loss.\nMalus Thorm: I profess there is another more profound.\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly.\nMalus Thorm: It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nAstarion: He's just like Cazador - utterly insane.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being?\nMalus Thorm: If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: But you: look how the succour of Shar eludes even you, one who walks faithfully in her shadow. See how painfully present you remain...\nMalus Thorm: We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: The sisters aren't ready. They'll make me sick instead of curing me.\nMalus Thorm: Their incisions are, as yet, still streaked with imprecision - that much I must concede.\nMalus Thorm: How to steady their hands, I wonder.\nPlayer: Practice - that's how I got good with a blade. They should spar each other.\nPlayer: Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\nMalus Thorm: Yes... For are we not all in need of a cure?\nMalus Thorm: The scalpel does not discriminate. Let each and every one of you partake in its soothing journey.\nMalus Thorm: Absence, sisters. Acquaint yourselves.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) Screaming and slashing, the sisters brutally murder each other.\nMalus Thorm: It is a proud moment when one sees one's teachings so lovingly taken to heart.\nMalus Thorm: You are to be commended for their graduation - rewarded with the promised cure.\nMalus Thorm: Come, I will acquaint you with the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nPlayer: My magic has blinded me - I see now that Shar is the only path. Show me how - I beg of you.\nPlayer: I would rather acquaint myself - if you show me how.\nMalus Thorm: Your diligence is exemplary. Very well: your own scalpel you will be.",

    "conversation": "Wyll: It's funny.\nWyll: As the Blade, I've faced untold brutes and beasts. Together we've seen illithid horrors most souls could merely fathom.\nWyll: I live at the mercy of fiends. A man with the horrid face of a devil, awaiting his future in Hells' blistered army.\nWyll: But I've only now come to see who my true enemy's been.\nPlayer: The poignant tedium of your story?\nWyll: I'd like to think not. The answer is much simpler than that:\nWyll: Time.\nWyll: Time is so gods-damned greedy. It can never give, only take.\nWyll: It builds mountains and deserts, only to tear them asunder. It fells armies, it conquers kings, queens - even gods.\nWyll: We blink, and we're gone. And our hopes, our memories, our heart-bonds are gone with us.\nWyll: It even comes for your people in the astral sea. Time may hunt slowly - but it still hunts.\nWyll: Lucky for us, I've found a way to stop it -\nWyll: If just for a moment.\nWyll: Come, let me show you.\nPlayer: I can't take your hand without hurting you, but I'll follow where you lead.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: The scene fades back in. Wyll and the player are near the Chionthar, and walk towards a towering and impressive tree. Acorns are scattered underneath it. It is a beautiful night; the moon and stars shine bright. NOTE: Karlach CANNOT take Wyll's hand, they shouldn't be touching.See N41\nWyll: The Wilden Oak. Legend has it it's stood since the Age of Dawn.\nWyll: I used to come here and climb it when father's eye was turned elsewhere - daydream of the stories it might tell, if I listened close enough.\nWyll: The dragon lords sparking the skies above it. The moon elves first plucking the strings of the Weave.\nWyll: Standing here, I feel like I can see into forever.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: The camera moves from the two of you and outwards. A vista of stunning and quiet beauty.\nPlayer: A beautiful story. I'm glad you told it to me.\nWyll: I was hoping you'd think so.\nWyll: I've been thinking a lot about forever. Moreso, I've been thinking everything that comes before -\nWyll: And who I want at my side as it passes.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Wyll kneels to the ground. He takes an acorn and holds it in the palm of his hands, but keeps them close to his body.\nWyll: My mother always said the Wilden Oak's acorns held just a touch of wishing magic.\nWyll: If that be so, then may my greatest wish come true tonight:\nWyll: I love you. Will you be mine - today, and tomorrow, and reaching into eternity?\nPlayer: I'm not sure. It's a lot to take in.\nWyll: It is. I swear, I've lived a thousand lives since I've known you.\nWyll: But I'm ready to live a thousand more, if you can bear me.\nPlayer: Yes. I want to be with you, for as long as you'll have me.\nWyll: Gods. You've made me the happiest soul in all the Realms.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: The player takes the acorn from Wyll's hands. He smiles, but remains kneeling.\nNarrator: *Your skin flushes and your soul sings as you palm the acorn. Wishing magic, affection, love - whatever the cause, it's as real as the ground beneath you.*\nWyll: Get down here, already. It's time we started our happily-ever-after!\nPlayer: It's about time. Let's see what the Blade can do with his weapon.\nPlayer: Join Wyll in the grass. Give yourself to him completely.",

The exhausted Grand Duke is a flurry of emotion - gratitude and relief, anger and deep pain.*\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: My own son, still the she-devil's toy. Is this my fate - to be freed from Gortash's hell only to be trapped in yours?\nWyll: It isn't what you think. It never was.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: You turned your back on me, on your city, to chase the she-devil and her power. She stinks up this place even now.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: It is exactly what I think.\nPlayer: Call on the parasite, connect with father and son.

Ravengard sees Wyll partnering with Mizora to defeat Tiamat's cultists before they could lay siege to Baldur's Gate.*\nNarrator: *And he sees everything beyond. The nautiloid journey, the perilous path to Moonrise, the Astral Prism, and the Emperor within.*\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Wyll.\nWyll: Everything I did, I did for Baldur's Gate. I did for you.\nPlayer: Heh. I bet you feel like a real bastard right about now.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: I do. And I should.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: My son, you sold your soul to save Baldur's Gate - and I cast you out for it.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: You gave yourself to the Hells' eternal fires so I might walk free.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: By the gods, can you ever forgive me?\nWyll: There's nothing to forgive. You wanted to protect the city. I only ever wanted the same.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: You are a better man than most, and a better son than I deserve. I'll yet make amends, but -\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: - my duty is first and foremost to the city and its people. There's something I must ask of you.\nPlayer: Go on.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Before I was captured, I was on a mission.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Returning from Elturel, I discovered the plans of the Absolutists. I immediately realised the city couldn't defend itself against such an army.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: I didn't despair because the city has a secret guardian, a wyrm that sleeps beneath. He can be called upon in times of great need.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: This is such a time. You've been trained in the ways of the great champions and proven to be one of them. The wyrm will answer your call. You must seek him out.\nPlayer: Waking a dragon doesn't sound like a good idea.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: This is no ordinary dragon.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: The wyrm goes by many names. Ansur. The Waiting Storm. The Heart of the Gate.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: He promised Balduran he'd protect the city if ever its existence was threatened. But just the once.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Since then, the city has faced countless threats, but we always overcame. There was never a need to call on the wyrm - until now.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: The Absolute is the greatest threat Baldur's Gate ever faced. The wyrm must be awakened - and the task falls to you.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: There is a tome - 'The Legend of Ansur'. An ancient epic, ill-remembered, dismissed as a mere tale.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: I once held a copy, but it was stolen. Find it, let it set the path before you.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Let it set the path before you.\nPlayer: Wyll? What do you make of this?",

You are stronger than even the great wyrm.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: You will be the one to part the storms and lead the people through.

The druids blame us 'outsiders' for drawing them here. Nobody's welcome anymore.\nZevlor: They've started a ritual to cut the grove off from the world outside.\nZevlor: We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: What brought you here?\nZevlor: We're refugees from Elturel - we took shelter here after gnolls attacked us on the road.\nZevlor: We were bound for Baldur's Gate, and it was too late to turn back. Elturel had no place for tieflings after the Descent.\nKarlach: Gods, these are those tiefs? Their whole city was dragged into Avernus for a while. Zariel was delighted.

But their ritual will force you out, too.\nZevlor: We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: This ritual - is there no way to convince the druids to stop it?\nZevlor: I've tried. Kagha - their new First Druid - won't even see me.\nZevlor: You, though... I know it's not your business, but she owes you for saving this place.\nZevlor: Perhaps you could persuade her. For more time to prepare, if nothing else.\nPlayer: I have my own temporal concerns. I need a healer.\nPlayer: I'll find her. And I'll speak to Kagha while I'm there.",

There's something I must ask of you.\nPlayer: Go on.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Before I was captured, I was on a mission.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Returning from Elturel, I discovered the plans of the Absolutists. I immediately realised the city couldn't defend itself against such an army.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: I didn't despair because the city has a secret guardian, a wyrm that sleeps beneath. He can be called upon in times of great need.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: This is such a time. You've been trained in the ways of the great champions and proven to be one of them. The wyrm will answer your call. You must seek him out.\nPlayer: A wyrm? Are you saying there's a dragon living under the city?\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: A bronze dragon, yes. He sleeps beneath us even now, awaiting a hero to rouse him.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: The wyrm goes by many names. Ansur. The Waiting Storm. The Heart of the Gate.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: He promised Balduran he'd protect the city if ever its existence was threatened. But just the once.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Since then, the city has faced countless threats, but we always overcame. There was never a need to call on the wyrm - until now.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: The Absolute is the greatest threat Baldur's Gate ever faced. The wyrm must be awakened - and the task falls to you.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Take this - 'The Legend of Ansur'. An ancient epic, ill-remembered, dismissed as a mere tale.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Let it set the path before you.\nPlayer: Your faith in Wyll is well-founded. We will seek the wyrm and ask for his help.",

The wyrm must be awakened - and the task falls to you.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Take this - 'The Legend of Ansur'.

The nautiloid journey, the perilous path to Moonrise, the Astral Prism, and the Emperor within.*\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Wyll.\nWyll: Everything I did, I did for Baldur's Gate. I did for you.\nPlayer: Heh. I bet you feel like a real bastard right about now.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: I do. And I should.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: My son, you sold your soul to save Baldur's Gate - and I cast you out for it.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: You gave yourself to the Hells' eternal fires so I might walk free.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: By the gods, can you ever forgive me?\nWyll: There's nothing to forgive. You wanted to protect the city. I only ever wanted the same.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: You are a better man than most, and a better son than I deserve. I'll yet make amends, but -\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: - my duty is first and foremost to the city and its people. There's something I must ask of you.\nPlayer: Go on.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Before I was captured, I was on a mission.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Returning from Elturel, I discovered the plans of the Absolutists. I immediately realised the city couldn't defend itself against such an army.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: I didn't despair because the city has a secret guardian, a wyrm that sleeps beneath. He can be called upon in times of great need.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: This is such a time. You've been trained in the ways of the great champions and proven to be one of them. The wyrm will answer your call. You must seek him out.\nPlayer: Waking a dragon doesn't sound like a good idea.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: This is no ordinary dragon.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: The wyrm goes by many names. Ansur. The Waiting Storm. The Heart of the Gate.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: He promised Balduran he'd protect the city if ever its existence was threatened. But just the once.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Since then, the city has faced countless threats, but we always overcame. There was never a need to call on the wyrm - until now.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: The Absolute is the greatest threat Baldur's Gate ever faced. The wyrm must be awakened - and the task falls to you.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Take this - 'The Legend of Ansur'. An ancient epic, ill-remembered, dismissed as a mere tale.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Let it set the path before you.\nPlayer: Wyll? What do you make of this?",
