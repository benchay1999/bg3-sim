Under his stewardship, the Bhaal Temple was revived, and with it, the Bhaal cult itself.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: Fortunately, the Temple was destroyed, and to cleanse the city of Sarevok's memory, the Iron Throne was torn from its foundations and cast into the Chionthar.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: For most, that was the end of it. But cults like that don't disappear overnight. This list you brought me confirms I'm right.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: The Bhaal cult is back, and someone is out there, continuing Sarevok's work.\nPlayer: You should raise this with your superiors, immediately.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: Don't you think I've tried? They won't listen.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: You're lucky you met me - most of the Fist wouldn't have believed you were a Bhaalspawn. Think it's Baldurian superstition.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: They told me to drop it. Told me the city doesn't need another conspiracy theorist and to get back to doing my job before they find someone else to do it for me.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: But you - you're not bound by such constraints. Help me out, here. Help the city out.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: I'll bet if you follow the trail of these murders, you'll be able to unearth the truth of this resurgence.\nPlayer: I'll do my best.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: You really are a godsend. But - one more thing...\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: There are patriars on the murder target list. I'm oathbound to secure them first, so I'll be heading to the Upper City next.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: While I'm there, the other potential victims will be at risk. Could you warn them?\nPlayer: I'll see what I can do.",
