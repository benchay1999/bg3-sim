Now.\nThe Warden: That tone might work on swaddled babes and puppies, but I am neither, True Soul.\nThe Warden: I'm not sure why someone of your stature must converse with prisoners.

My blade rests. Mother Gith compels you to listen.\nPlayer: Your cronies tried to kill us. Why should Lae'zel listen to you?\nKith'rak Voss: I knew you would fight - and I knew you would win. I needed to ensure Vlaakith's trust. This was the only way.\nKith'rak Voss: I know you carry the Astral Prism, Lae'zel.\nKith'rak Voss: Within it lies the seed of Vlaakith's demise. And I intend to help you bring it to fruition.\nLae'zel: Vlaakith's demise? Shka'keth. I should run you through for suggesting it.\nPlayer: I'm not giving you the Astral Prism, if that's what you're wanting.\nKith'rak Voss: It is not.\nKith'rak Voss: I've heard word from Crèche Y'llek. You are infected - yet the one in the Prism has chosen you, protects you with their power.\nKith'rak Voss: The Prism's tenant alone has the power to end Vlaakith's tyranny.\nKith'rak Voss: I've sought their freedom for aeons. When the Prism went missing, I feared the worst.\nKith'rak Voss: Instead, you've granted the opportunity I've so long awaited.\nKith'rak Voss: All that remains is the key that unchains them - and I've found someone who I believe can provide it.\nKith'rak Voss: Bring the Prism to Baldur's Gate. I'll be waiting in a taproom called Sharess' Caress. That is where we decide the fate of my people.\nKith'rak Voss: Lae'zel - together we will break our chains, and be Vlaakith's slaves no longer.\nLae'zel: I am no slave, Jhe'stil Kith'rak. The Undying Queen is my freedom. It is she who will purify me, and she who will ascend me.\nKith'rak Voss: Lies, Lae'zel - every last one. There is no purification, no ascension.\nKith'rak Voss: The zaith'isk does not purify - it extracts memory and kills the infected. Nor does the lich queen glorify the ascended. She feeds on most all of them to grow her power and pursue godhood.\nLae'zel: Madness. You flood me with this... this heresy.\nNodeContext: Not nearly as aggressive as usual.

She taught me that.\nShadowheart: Why? Why me? Why all this effort?\nViconia DeVir: Lady Shar commanded me. And I obeyed. I do not question - I merely act as she wills me to.\nViconia DeVir: I had an enclave in Waterdeep, you know. Much grander than this. Shar ordered me to raze it, kill all who followed me - claim they betrayed me, when in fact I slew those who showed nothing but loyalty.\nViconia DeVir: Shar had me do that, and I did. To cover my tracks. To usher in you.\nShadowheart: What are you talking about?\nViconia DeVir: You became my mission. To take a child of Selûne's, and turn her over to Lady Shar. To show that all light fades, and darkness will prevail in the end.\nViconia DeVir: All this was to make you into what the Dark Lady needed you to be - the planning. The training. Those deaths in Waterdeep. It was all to groom you to replace me at her right hand side. And still, you threw it away.\nPlayer: What do you want to do, Shadowheart?\nShadowheart: I want to see my parents. And I don't care what happens to this one. She's been in my head long enough already. Do what you like. I know you'll choose well.\nViconia DeVir: What are you doing? Come back and finish this yourself! You owe me that!\nShadowheart: Let go, Mother. Embrace loss.\nJaheira: She stands at the same crossroads you yourself once did, Viconia - but it seems you are not quite the teacher you thought.\nMinsc: Boo thinks you have had every chance to change your ways. Count yourself blessed it is not he who judges you today.\nPlayer: Go. If you're wise, you'll vanish.",

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon’s voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar.\nMalus Thorm: See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy.\nMalus Thorm: Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace.\nMalus Thorm: Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver.\nMalus Thorm: Come. Step forward. You are no sister, but that matters none. Every student is welcome.\nPlayer: I don't wish to study, only to lift the curse on this land.\nMalus Thorm: A curse? Nay, a cure that leads to the very pinnacle of being:\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly.\nMalus Thorm: It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nLae'zel: Only a beast of a man toys with his victim. Entertaining, if not efficient.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being?\nMalus Thorm: If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: You are well on your way. But one white orb disfigures you still. Let us finish the cure.\nMalus Thorm: We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: Your subject is tainted. Shar's succour must only be granted to the willing.\nMalus Thorm: Hmmm. 'Only the willing may know the Lady's embrace.' You know her teachings well.\nMalus Thorm: And yet, these sisters must exercise their gifts, for the art of absence lies in its execution.\nMalus Thorm: How to proceed, I wonder.\nPlayer: Sparring is vital to progress. Have them practice on each other.\nPlayer: Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\n: True\nMalus Thorm: Yes... For are we not all in need of a cure?\nMalus Thorm: The scalpel does not discriminate. Let each and every one of you partake in its soothing journey.\nMalus Thorm: Absence, sisters. Acquaint yourselves.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) Screaming and slashing, the sisters brutally murder each other.\nMalus Thorm: It is a proud moment when one sees one's teachings so lovingly taken to heart.\nMalus Thorm: You are to be commended for their graduation - rewarded with the promised cure.\nMalus Thorm: Come, I will acquaint you with the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nPlayer: You do me an honour, but I am not worthy. Show me the way of Shar - I beg of you.\nPlayer: I would rather acquaint myself - if you show me how.\n: True\nMalus Thorm: Your diligence is exemplary. Very well: your own scalpel you will be.",

Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy.\nMalus Thorm: Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace.\nMalus Thorm: Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver.\nMalus Thorm: Come. Step forward. You are no sister, but that matters none. Every student is welcome.\nPlayer: I don't wish to study, only to lift the curse on this land.\nMalus Thorm: A curse? Nay, a cure that leads to the very pinnacle of being:\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence.

Entertaining, if not efficient.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being?\nMalus Thorm: If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: You are well on your way. But one white orb disfigures you still. Let us finish the cure.\nMalus Thorm: We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: Your subject is tainted. Shar's succour must only be granted to the willing.\nMalus Thorm: Hmmm. 'Only the willing may know the Lady's embrace.' You know her teachings well.\nMalus Thorm: And yet, these sisters must exercise their gifts, for the art of absence lies in its execution.\nMalus Thorm: How to proceed, I wonder.\nPlayer: Sparring is vital to progress. Have them practice on each other.\nPlayer: Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\n: True\nMalus Thorm: Yes... For are we not all in need of a cure?\nMalus Thorm: The scalpel does not discriminate. Let each and every one of you partake in its soothing journey.\nMalus Thorm: Absence, sisters. Acquaint yourselves.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) Screaming and slashing, the sisters brutally murder each other.\nMalus Thorm: It is a proud moment when one sees one's teachings so lovingly taken to heart.\nMalus Thorm: You are to be commended for their graduation - rewarded with the promised cure.\nMalus Thorm: Come, I will acquaint you with the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nPlayer: I would rather acquaint myself - if you show me how.\n: True\nMalus Thorm: Your diligence is exemplary.

I've come to aid you.\nGROUP_Daisy: Don't trust him.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: [SCENE] Voss kneels and lays his sword on the ground in the githyanki sign of submission.\nKith'rak Voss: Ska'kek kir Gith shabell'eth. My blade rests. Mother Gith compels you to listen.\nPlayer: Your cronies tried to kill us. Why should Lae'zel listen to you?\nKith'rak Voss: I knew you would fight - and I knew you would win. I needed to ensure Vlaakith's trust. This was the only way.\nKith'rak Voss: I know you carry the Astral Prism, Lae'zel.\nKith'rak Voss: Within it lies the seed of Vlaakith's demise. And I intend to help you bring it to fruition.\nLae'zel: Vlaakith's demise? Shka'keth. I should run you through for suggesting it.\nPlayer: I'm not giving you the Astral Prism, if that's what you're wanting.\nKith'rak Voss: It is not.\nKith'rak Voss: I've heard word from Crèche Y'llek. You are infected - yet the one in the Prism has chosen you, protects you with their power.\nKith'rak Voss: The Prism's tenant alone has the power to end Vlaakith's tyranny.\nKith'rak Voss: I've sought their freedom for aeons. When the Prism went missing, I feared the worst.\nKith'rak Voss: Instead, you've granted the opportunity I've so long awaited.\nKith'rak Voss: All that remains is the key that unchains them - and I've found someone who I believe can provide it.\nKith'rak Voss: Bring the Prism to Baldur's Gate. I'll be waiting in a taproom called Sharess' Caress. That is where we decide the fate of my people.\nKith'rak Voss: Lae'zel - together we will break our chains, and be Vlaakith's slaves no longer.\nLae'zel: I am no slave, Jhe'stil Kith'rak. The Undying Queen is my freedom. It is she who will purify me, and she who will ascend me.\nKith'rak Voss: Lies, Lae'zel - every last one. There is no purification, no ascension.\nKith'rak Voss: The zaith'isk does not purify - it extracts memory and kills the infected. Nor does the lich queen glorify the ascended. She feeds on most all of them to grow her power and pursue godhood.\nLae'zel: Madness. You flood me with this... this heresy.\nNodeContext: Not nearly as aggressive as usual. She believes him but is keeping up appearances.\nLae'zel: I... I will hear no more of it.\nNodeContext: Rising alittle in anger but questioning. She is ready to be convinced. But she has to keep up appearances.\nPlayer: What do you want to do Lae'zel? I have your back.",

To cover my tracks. To usher in you.\nShadowheart: What are you talking about?\nViconia DeVir: You became my mission. To take a child of Selûne's, and turn her over to Lady Shar. To show that all light fades, and darkness will prevail in the end.\nViconia DeVir: All this was to make you into what the Dark Lady needed you to be - the planning. The training. Those deaths in Waterdeep. It was all to groom you to replace me at her right hand side. And still, you threw it away.\nPlayer: What do you want to do, Shadowheart?\nShadowheart: I want to see my parents. And I don't care what happens to this one.

You wanted to protect the city. I only ever wanted the same.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: You are a better man than most, and a better son than I deserve. I'll yet make amends, but -\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: - my duty is first and foremost to the city and its people. There's something I must ask of you.\nPlayer: Go on.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Before I was captured, I was on a mission.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Returning from Elturel, I discovered the plans of the Absolutists. I immediately realised the city couldn't defend itself against such an army.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: I didn't despair because the city has a secret guardian, a wyrm that sleeps beneath. He can be called upon in times of great need.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: This is such a time. You've been trained in the ways of the great champions and proven to be one of them. The wyrm will answer your call. You must seek him out.\nPlayer: Waking a dragon doesn't sound like a good idea.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: This is no ordinary dragon.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: The wyrm goes by many names. Ansur. The Waiting Storm. The Heart of the Gate.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: He promised Balduran he'd protect the city if ever its existence was threatened. But just the once.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Since then, the city has faced countless threats, but we always overcame. There was never a need to call on the wyrm - until now.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: The Absolute is the greatest threat Baldur's Gate ever faced. The wyrm must be awakened - and the task falls to you.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Take this - 'The Legend of Ansur'. An ancient epic, ill-remembered, dismissed as a mere tale.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Let it set the path before you.\nPlayer: Wyll? What do you make of this?",

I did for you.\nPlayer: It's the truth, Ravengard. Wyll has always been a faithful defender of Baldur's Gate.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: My son, you sold your soul to save Baldur's Gate - and I cast you out for it.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: You gave yourself to the Hells' eternal fires so I might walk free.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: By the gods, can you ever forgive me?\nWyll: There's nothing to forgive. You wanted to protect the city. I only ever wanted the same.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: You are a better man than most, and a better son than I deserve.

I immediately realised the city couldn't defend itself against such an army.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: I didn't despair because the city has a secret guardian, a wyrm that sleeps beneath. He can be called upon in times of great need.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: This is such a time. You've been trained in the ways of the great champions and proven to be one of them. The wyrm will answer your call. You must seek him out.\nPlayer: A wyrm? Are you saying there's a dragon living under the city?\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: A bronze dragon, yes. He sleeps beneath us even now, awaiting a hero to rouse him.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: The wyrm goes by many names. Ansur. The Waiting Storm. The Heart of the Gate.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: He promised Balduran he'd protect the city if ever its existence was threatened. But just the once.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Since then, the city has faced countless threats, but we always overcame. There was never a need to call on the wyrm - until now.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: The Absolute is the greatest threat Baldur's Gate ever faced. The wyrm must be awakened - and the task falls to you.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Take this - 'The Legend of Ansur'. An ancient epic, ill-remembered, dismissed as a mere tale.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Let it set the path before you.\nPlayer: Your faith in Wyll is well-founded.

He can be called upon in times of great need.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: This is such a time. You've been trained in the ways of the great champions and proven to be one of them. The wyrm will answer your call.

But just the once.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Since then, the city has faced countless threats, but we always overcame. There was never a need to call on the wyrm - until now.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: The Absolute is the greatest threat Baldur's Gate ever faced. The wyrm must be awakened - and the task falls to you.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Take this - 'The Legend of Ansur'.

Ravengard sees Wyll partnering with Mizora to defeat Tiamat's cultists before they could lay siege to Baldur's Gate.*\nNarrator: *And he sees everything beyond. The nautiloid journey, the perilous path to Moonrise, the Astral Prism, and the Emperor within.*\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Wyll.\nWyll: Everything I did, I did for Baldur's Gate. I did for you.\nPlayer: It's the truth, Ravengard. Wyll has always been a faithful defender of Baldur's Gate.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: My son, you sold your soul to save Baldur's Gate - and I cast you out for it.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: You gave yourself to the Hells' eternal fires so I might walk free.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: By the gods, can you ever forgive me?\nWyll: There's nothing to forgive. You wanted to protect the city. I only ever wanted the same.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: You are a better man than most, and a better son than I deserve. I'll yet make amends, but -\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: - my duty is first and foremost to the city and its people. There's something I must ask of you.\nPlayer: Go on.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Before I was captured, I was on a mission.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Returning from Elturel, I discovered the plans of the Absolutists. I immediately realised the city couldn't defend itself against such an army.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: I didn't despair because the city has a secret guardian, a wyrm that sleeps beneath. He can be called upon in times of great need.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: This is such a time. You've been trained in the ways of the great champions and proven to be one of them. The wyrm will answer your call. You must seek him out.\nPlayer: What lessons do you mean?\nWyll: Courage. Insight. Strategy. Justice. I remember them well. You made me recite them every morning.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: So you do. And I thought you'd abandoned them, more fool me.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: The wyrm goes by many names. Ansur. The Waiting Storm. The Heart of the Gate.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: He promised Balduran he'd protect the city if ever its existence was threatened. But just the once.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Since then, the city has faced countless threats, but we always overcame. There was never a need to call on the wyrm - until now.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: The Absolute is the greatest threat Baldur's Gate ever faced. The wyrm must be awakened - and the task falls to you.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: There is a tome - 'The Legend of Ansur'. An ancient epic, ill-remembered, dismissed as a mere tale.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: I once held a copy, but it was stolen. Find it, let it set the path before you.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Let it set the path before you.\nPlayer: Your faith in Wyll is well-founded. We will seek the wyrm and ask for his help.",

Then I finish the duke's traitorous son.\nPlayer: Zariel's stunt destroyed countless lives. Mizora is her minion - you can't trust her.\nCordula Eltan: Stand down.\nCordula Eltan: I believe you, the Battle Lord help me.\nCordula Eltan: What darkness has fallen upon us.\nCordula Eltan: Listen, there's something Wyll should know. On his way from Elturel, Ravengard sent a messenger with word of the cult.\nCordula Eltan: He knew about the Absolute. I thought little of it at first - but he realised the danger before anyone else did.\nCordula Eltan: He understood that if the cult were successful in raising an army, Baldur's Gate would be doomed.\nCordula Eltan: And he knew that to protect the city, one trained in the ways of the great champions would have to rouse the wyrm living beneath. If I'm not mistaken, that would be Wyll.\nPlayer: The city has found its protector, thank you very much. Me.\nCordula Eltan: Only a true champion can awaken the wyrm. As the Blade of Frontiers, Wyll has proven his worth. Please, give him this message.\nCordula Eltan: The wyrm goes by many names. Ansur. The Waiting Storm. The Heart of the Gate.\nCordula Eltan: He made Balduran a binding promise to protect the city when its need was greatest.\nCordula Eltan: The city's survived countless threats. But Ravengard knew its walls would fall to the cult.\nCordula Eltan: With him gone and the city near ruin, your call is to unleash the Heart of the Gate.\nCordula Eltan: There is a tome - 'The Legend of Ansur'. The bards call it a tall tale. But every last word is true.\nCordula Eltan: Find it, and follow its path to the wyrm. Or do not, and let the Coast be drowned in blood.\nCordula Eltan: Follow its path to the wyrm. Or do not, and let the Coast be drowned in blood.\nPlayer: Your faith in us is well-founded. We will seek the wyrm and ask for his help.",

You saw what I saw - Karlach is not a danger.\n: False\nWyll: No. Devils can not be trusted!\nPlayer: It's you I don't trust, Wyll. You wanted a fight? You've got it.\nKarlach: How about we all take a nice deep breath and calm the fuck down. Just cause I want to live doesn't mean I want him dead.\nPlayer: Fine, but he needs to stand down. We saw the truth for ourselves.\nKarlach: Would you listen to sense? This doesn't have to end badly - for either of us.\nKarlach: You know monsters better than anyone. Can't you look in my eyes and see I'm not a devil?\nWyll: You don't know what this means. You don't know what you're asking me to do.\nKarlach: I'm asking you to live, Wyll. I don't want to hurt you. And, to be frank, I'd rather not find out how the Blade got his name.\nKarlach: I swear to you, on all I am, I'm not what you think.\nWyll: Shit. Shit.\nWyll: You really are no devil, are you?

The wyrm must be awakened - and the task falls to you.\nDuke Ulder Ravengard: Take this - 'The Legend of Ansur'.

I sensed the tadpole in his head.\nIsobel: A tadpole? Maiden's milk - how could that be?\nPlayer: I have no reason to lie. Marcus was a danger to you all.\n: True\nIsobel: In that case, I owe you a debt of gratitude.\nIsobel: You're the True Soul from the gate, right? It's a good thing you were here. I'm Isobel. And we have much to discuss.\nPlayer: I may be a True Soul, but I'm not like Marcus. The parasite doesn't control me.\nIsobel: If I didn't believe it before, I certainly do now.\nIsobel: Speaking of blessings... you'll be needing my protection spell.\nIsobel: Let me guess: Jaheira's sent you to beg a protection spell off her favourite cleric.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: |Casts 'Protection from Good and Evil', but modified with Selunite (moon) magic to protect against the Shadowcurse specifically.

You yearn for it so deeply...*\nShadowheart: Ngh... it hurts...\nIsobel: Perfect.\nIsobel: It'll make you immune to the lesser effects of the shadow curse, which will get you closer to the Towers.\nIsobel: But there are places it won't help - places where the curse is darker. Stronger.\nIsobel: The cultists are able to traverse even the deepest shadows, though. I don't know how - the Harpers are trying to figure it out.\nShadowheart: A gaudy display. Let's just hope it actually protects us.\nNodeContext: Distaste (while keeping her cards to her chest re: her shar worship)\nIsobel: Only a fool would doubt it.\nPlayer: Very nice of you, but I've been to Moonrise Towers already.\nIsobel: You... have. Forgive me for gilding the lily. I suppose if Jaheira hasn't gone tearing into the night, there's work to be done there yet.\nIsobel: I wish you luck.

He is still the man you thought he was.\nCordula Eltan: Stand down.\nCordula Eltan: I believe you, the Battle Lord help me.\nCordula Eltan: What darkness has fallen upon us.\nCordula Eltan: Listen, there's something Wyll should know. On his way from Elturel, Ravengard sent a messenger with word of the cult.\nCordula Eltan: He knew about the Absolute. I thought little of it at first - but he realised the danger before anyone else did.\nCordula Eltan: He understood that if the cult were successful in raising an army, Baldur's Gate would be doomed.\nCordula Eltan: And he knew that to protect the city, one trained in the ways of the great champions would have to rouse the wyrm living beneath. If I'm not mistaken, that would be Wyll.\nPlayer: Why would this training matter?\nCordula Eltan: It is said that only a true champion can awaken the Wyrm. Now that the Grand Duke has fallen, the duty falls to his son.\nCordula Eltan: The wyrm goes by many names. Ansur. The Waiting Storm.
