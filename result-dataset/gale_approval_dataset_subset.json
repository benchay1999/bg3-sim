Her hands are in a prayer position and she's chanting softly as the moonlight dances around her. She exhales, then inhales and breaths in tendrils of shadow, absorbing them. She swallows, then begins hacking coughing. The moonlight dissipates. She quickly goes from seeming like a divine spirit to a normal young woman.\nIsobel: I didn't realise I had an audience.\nFist Marcus: Isobel. This is -\nIsobel: A Sharran.\nNarrator: *Isobel. The same name as Ketheric Thorm's daughter - the one whose sarcophagus you found empty in the family mausoleum.*\nPlayer: Push your Urges down. This Sharran exposed a traitor in your midst.\nIsobel: Fair. I admit, Marcus waltzing around the place undetected bodes rather ill for our defences, doesn't it? Then again, the best defence is a good offence. Frankly, I'm surprised you're willing to help us. Your kind aren't known for their decency - particularly when a Sharran curse is our greatest obstacle. But if you are who I think you are, I'd be a fool to reject your help. The True Soul with... well, a soul. Imagine.\nPlayer: I'm glad you've remembered who needs whose help here.\nIsobel: Oh - aren't you looking for a protection spell?\nPlayer: Nod. Better to humour her than make an enemy of all in this place. Lady Shar will understand.\nIsobel: Refreshingly pragmatic of you. I sense Shar has offered some amount of protection to you already, but... well, no harm in extra precaution - even from a Sel√ªnite.\nPlayer: Try to understand what's happening.\nNarrator: *Is Lady Shar punishing you? Or perhaps testing you? Is it the tadpole, or a curse? You cannot say.*\nIsobel: Well! If the Moonmaiden didn't strike me dead for blessing you, she must rather approve of this little alliance. This will block the lesser effects of the shadow curse, allowing you to traverse the darkness outside... should Shar's own protection falter, that is. Curious. Surely the Nightsinger could have shielded all her followers, and made this place her domain long ago... yet she only acts now, and aids you alone. I wonder why.\nPlayer: The Dark Lady's works aren't for me to question.\nIsobel: Mustn't question the great shadow mother, must we? I'll stop needling you, though. You have more important things to do, after all.\nPlayer: I've already been to Moonrise, but I have more work to do indeed.\nIsobel: I imagine so, if Jaheira hasn't gone tearing off into the night.\nPlayer: You're coming with me, cleric.",

Her hands are in a prayer position and she's chanting softly as the moonlight dances around her. She exhales, then inhales and breaths in tendrils of shadow, absorbing them. She swallows, then begins hacking coughing. The moonlight dissipates. She quickly goes from seeming like a divine spirit to a normal young woman.\nIsobel: I didn't realise I had an audience.\nFist Marcus: Isobel. This is -\nIsobel: A Sharran.\nNarrator: *Isobel.

Frankly, I'm surprised you're willing to help us. Your kind aren't known for their decency - particularly when a Sharran curse is our greatest obstacle.

Imagine.\nPlayer: I'm glad you've remembered who needs whose help here.\nIsobel: Oh - aren't you looking for a protection spell?\nPlayer: I am already protected. My Lady shields me from the curse.\nIsobel: For now, perhaps. But Shar can be fickle, and her love can prove fleeting. Do not turn your back on an advantage you may need... even a Sel√ªnite one. If nothing else, it can aid any companions who travel with you - somehow I doubt Shar's largesse was extended to them.\nPlayer: Silently petition Lady Shar for guidance.\nNarrator: *She offers you nothing.*\nIsobel: Well! If the Moonmaiden didn't strike me dead for blessing you, she must rather approve of this little alliance. This will block the lesser effects of the shadow curse, allowing you to traverse the darkness outside... should Shar's own protection falter, that is. Curious. Surely the Nightsinger could have shielded all her followers, and made this place her domain long ago... yet she only acts now, and aids you alone. I wonder why.\nPlayer: The Dark Lady's works aren't for me to question.\nIsobel: Mustn't question the great shadow mother, must we? I'll stop needling you, though.

Perfect. If the inhabitants do not realise you are the knife at their throats, we can use that against them. Go to their refuge and make your way inside. As a friend.\nPlayer: And once I'm inside?\nNightwarden Minthara: I will gather a raiding party and move into position. You will open the gates from the inside when the time is right to strike. We will cleanse the place of infidels and burn it to the ground in the Absolute's name. And then we will be the first among Her favourites.\nNarrator: *The masterful painting she depicts of the massacre awakens you hungrily.*\nPlayer: Reject these dreams of a bloodbath.\nNightwarden Minthara: The Absolute brought you here for a reason - to throw open those gates so we can crush our enemies.\nPlayer: You're right.

Her hands are in a prayer position and she's chanting softly as the moonlight dances around her. She exhales, then inhales and breaths in tendrils of shadow, absorbing them. She swallows, then begins hacking coughing. The moonlight dissipates. She quickly goes from seeming like a divine spirit to a normal young woman.\nIsobel: I didn't realise I had an audience.\nFist Marcus: Isobel. This is -\nIsobel: A Sharran.\nNarrator: *Isobel. The same name as Ketheric Thorm's daughter - the one whose sarcophagus you found empty in the family mausoleum.*\nPlayer: Push your Urges down. I thought I smelled a Sel√ªnite.\nIsobel: At your service. Frankly, I'm surprised you're willing to help us. Your kind aren't known for their decency - particularly when a Sharran curse is our greatest obstacle. But if you are who I think you are, I'd be a fool to reject your help. The True Soul with... well, a soul. Imagine.\nPlayer: I may have the parasite of a True Soul, but not the mind of one.\nIsobel: And that's what makes you essential. You'll be needing the protection spell, I presume? Oh - aren't you looking for a protection spell?\nPlayer: I am already protected. My Lady shields me from the curse.\nIsobel: For now, perhaps. But Shar can be fickle, and her love can prove fleeting. Do not turn your back on an advantage you may need... even a Sel√ªnite one. If nothing else, it can aid any companions who travel with you - somehow I doubt Shar's largesse was extended to them.\nPlayer: It was nothing. Put it out of your mind.\nNarrator: *But was it truly nothing? The pain gripped you tight, robbing you of all composure for a moment...*\nIsobel: Well! If the Moonmaiden didn't strike me dead for blessing you, she must rather approve of this little alliance. This will block the lesser effects of the shadow curse, allowing you to traverse the darkness outside... should Shar's own protection falter, that is. Curious. Surely the Nightsinger could have shielded all her followers, and made this place her domain long ago... yet she only acts now, and aids you alone. I wonder why.\nPlayer: I don't know what to make of it myself.\nIsobel: I suppose Shar is nothing if not mysterious. I'll stop needling you, though. You have more important things to do, after all.\nPlayer: I've already been to Moonrise, but I have more work to do indeed.\nIsobel: I imagine so, if Jaheira hasn't gone tearing off into the night.\nPlayer: You're coming with me, cleric.",

She quickly goes from seeming like a divine spirit to a normal young woman.\nIsobel: I didn't realise I had an audience.\nFist Marcus: Isobel. This is -\nIsobel: A Sharran.\nNarrator: *Isobel. The same name as Ketheric Thorm's daughter - the one whose sarcophagus you found empty in the family mausoleum.*\nPlayer: Push your Urges down. Isobel - Isobel Thorm?\nNarrator: *Her breath catches; you notice a barely-perceptible shudder run through her body.*\nIsobel: An unfortunate coincidence. I hope never to meet the wicked man who haemorrhaged shadows over this peaceful village. I've heard you might be the person to stop him. A True Soul with a soul. Imagine.

Oh - aren't you looking for a protection spell?\nPlayer: I need nothing from a Sel√ªnite.\nIsobel: But any others who travel with you may not agree. Do it for them at least - you will need all the help you can get out there.\nNarrator: *Pain bursts from the wound on your hand. You see yourself kneeling in a dark hall, surrounded by initiates.

If the Moonmaiden didn't strike me dead for blessing you, she must rather approve of this little alliance. This will block the lesser effects of the shadow curse, allowing you to traverse the darkness outside... should Shar's own protection falter, that is. Curious. Surely the Nightsinger could have shielded all her followers, and made this place her domain long ago... yet she only acts now, and aids you alone. I wonder why.\nPlayer: I don't know what to make of it myself.\nIsobel: I suppose Shar is nothing if not mysterious. I'll stop needling you, though.

I was miles away.\nNodeContext: Gale is looking at a miniature magical projection of Mystra he's created in his hand in his hand.

The figure I saw: she means something to you.\nGale: She does. She's... She's Mystra. I can't quite describe it, the need I sometimes feel to see her - to draw the filaments of fantasy into existence. No sculpture or painting could ever do her justice, only the fabric that she herself is and embodies: The Weave. Mystra is all magic. And as far as I'm concerned, she is all creation.\nPlayer: Sounding more of a poet than a wizard there, Gale.\nGale: It's a kind of love after all. Magic is... my life. I've been in touch with the Weave for as long as I can remember. There's nothing like it. It's like music, poetry, physical beauty all rolled into one and given expression through the senses. Would you like to experience this?\nPlayer: Yes, I would.\nGale: Then follow my lead.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: ~Gale walks around behind the player (as though teaching them to fly a kite) and makes a delicate gesture with both hands.\nGale: Now you.\nPlayer: Imitate the gesture with a flourish.\nNarrator: *You feel something strange - like a kind word and a kind touch at the same time.

There‚Äôs the start of a glow, of a rush of beautiful magic.\nNarrator: *Ah, yes: the scent of rosewater and a sense of wellbeing.

The Weave is a sensitive conduit.\nNarrator: *The Weave connects you. The moment feels intimate.*\nPlayer: Hold on to the moment.

He's looking at the figure intensely.\nPlayer: Pretty.\nGale: Oh! My, you startled me. I... I was miles away.\nNodeContext: Gale is looking at a miniature magical projection of Mystra he's created in his hand in his hand. Startled, he dispells it.\nPlayer: Is everything all right?\nGale: Of course, of course. I was just... practising an incantation.\nPlayer: There's more to it than that. The figure I saw: she means something to you.\nGale: She does. She's... She's Mystra. I can't quite describe it, the need I sometimes feel to see her - to draw the filaments of fantasy into existence. No sculpture or painting could ever do her justice, only the fabric that she herself is and embodies: The Weave. Mystra is all magic. And as far as I'm concerned, she is all creation.\nPlayer: I didn't realise the depth of your devotion.\nGale: Magic is... my life. I've been in touch with the Weave for as long as I can remember. There's nothing like it. It's like music, poetry, physical beauty all rolled into one and given expression through the senses. Would you like to experience this?\nPlayer: Magic normally comes to me through prayer, but I don't mind trying.\nGale: Then follow my lead.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: ~Gale walks around behind the player (as though teaching them to fly a kite) and makes a delicate gesture with both hands.\nGale: Now you.\nPlayer: Imitate the gesture with ease.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: ~The player imitates the gesture. There‚Äôs a first visual effect. Some sparks of magic start to appear around the player and Gale.\nNarrator: *A familiar feeling - like a kind word and a kind touch at the same time. It's warm and comfortable.*\nGale: Excellent. Now repeat after me: Ah-Thran Mystra-Ryl Kantrach-Ao.\nPlayer: An easy incantation. Simply repeat after Gale.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: The visual effect intensifies. There‚Äôs the start of a glow, of a rush of beautiful magic.\nNarrator: *Ah, yes: the scent of rosewater and a sense of wellbeing. A sliver of Weave that tastes sweet on the tongue.*\nGale: Very good. Now I want you to picture in your mind the concept of harmony. As true as you can.\nPlayer: Picture the perfect darkness - to be in the womb of Shar.\nNarrator: *You see - or is it sense? - the presence of a woman, the woman who hovered over Gale's palm.* *There's something like the anticipation of a kiss, then the pleasure of being cloaked in peace.* *You are safe. You are nestled in the cup of Mystra's hand.*\nGale: Look at that. We're channelling the Weave. How does it feel? You did it. You're channelling the Weave. How does it feel?\nPlayer: The same as it always does.\nGale: You're hard to please, aren't you?\nNarrator: *The Weave connects you. The moment feels intimate.*\nPlayer: Hold on to the moment. It's a good night for intimacy.\nNarrator: *You realise the Weave is making you one. You have but to imagine your desire, and Gale will know it.*\nPlayer: Picture kicking him in the gut.",

You nod, rapt.*\nInternalNodeContext: Incurable wound imagery/memoriy fragment\nIsobel: Well!

This will block the lesser effects of the shadow curse, allowing you to traverse the darkness outside... should Shar's own protection falter, that is. Curious.

You will open the gates from the inside when the time is right to strike. We will cleanse the place of infidels and burn it to the ground in the Absolute's name.

The cradle of eternity. The timelessness of lovers. That most beautiful of fantasies.\nPlayer: I'm afraid all of this is just a fantasy.\nGale: So it is. But a very fine one. This may be my last night alive. I wanted it to be under a canopy of beauty and wonder... ...and with company to match.\nNodeContext: Full of longing\nGale: I thought this place might bring me peace. I thought it might make the weight of what I must do feel a little lighter... but I am not so sure.\nPlayer: Are you not afraid?\nGale: Afraid? No, I am terrified. But fear or courage or reason cannot change the charge I've been given. There is no point in running from the inevitable. Better to meet it, on my own terms.\nPlayer: You sound sure in your course of action then.\nGale: Resigned to it, rather. But that is not to say I am without fear. Far from it. Stay with me a while, will you? Day will come all too soon, even in this place.\nPlayer: I'd rather not listen to you wallowing in self-pity. Good night, Gale.",

I suppose you know about Ketheric, then. His invincibility. That we'll never cleanse this place until he's made to bleed. We met him on the road here - commanding an army of the Absolute, intent on destroying Baldur's Gate. I put an arrow through his eye myself, only to watch him pluck it out like a splinter. He healed right in front of me, and chased us into the shadows. Things looked hopeless, but experience has taught me that no matter how bleak things look, there's always hope. You are that hope.\nPlayer: It's rare people look at me and see 'hope'.\nJaheira: The light is rather dim, out here in the shadowlands. The point remains: Protected by your artefact, you can infiltrate his forces at Moonrise Towers, posing as a True Soul. Find out what it is that makes him invincible so we can strip him of his advantage. Once Ketheric is without his shield, the sword: together we assault his tower, and put a final end to this blight.\nPlayer: There's something you should know - Marcus, the Flaming Fist upstairs, is a True Soul.

Mostly full of tieflin's, but them intruders you're after were hidin' out there!\nNightwarden Minthara: I presume you dealt with my prey, and massacred the rest?\nSazza: Ah... well, the thing about that is... they sorta massacred us. This mug helped me escape though. I say we stick a few holes in them... show how grateful we are.\n\nNarrator: *You feel a cold hand caress your mind as the drow appraises you.*\nNightwarden Minthara: Oh dear. Your prisoner is one of the Absolute's favourites, Sazza. A True Soul.\nSazza: Nah. Can't be... they woz in the grove, hangin' around with the tieflin's.\nNightwarden Minthara: Undercover, no doubt. Carrying out the Absolute's will. Oh, Sazza - you have made a grave error. And it will be your last. My spiders are hungry, little one... ...but before they feast, tell me where that grove is, and I may yet spare your life.\nSazza: It's past the bridge, to the east! Big ol' gate, covered in ivy! Don't hurt me, mistress. Please!\nNightwarden Minthara: I will not hurt you. My spiders will have that pleasure.\nSazza: No! I mucked up, I'm sorry! But I didn't know who they woz... they didn't tell me nothin'!\nPlayer: Keep quiet.\nSazza: You coulda told me who you woz!

And it seems that the inhabitants of the grove trust you - we can use that against them. You have a part to play in this slaughter. Return to the grove. When my raiding party approaches, throw open the gate and signal me.\nNarrator: *The fate of the grove's inhabitants hangs in the balance.* *Killing the drow here would spare them, but it might be better to face her warband at the grove itself, on familiar ground.* *On the other hand, participating in the slaughter as she asks may be the perfect way to earn her trust, and access to the cult's inner circle.*\nPlayer: I want no part of this.\nNightwarden Minthara: I do not intend to lead a suicidal charge. The goblins are expendable; I am not. The Absolute brought you here for a reason - to throw open those gates and crush our enemies.\nPlayer: All right. Expect me at the grove.",

    "conversation": "Jaheira: There is a grave threat to us all, stretching as far as Baldur's Gate, and I need your help. The cult of the Absolute is spreading through the city - quietly, quickly, and with unsettling deliberation. We tracked them to this ancient village only to be faced with a man we killed and buried over a century ago.\nPlayer: Ketheric Thorm. He and I have history.\nJaheira: You were the one who rescued those the Absolute had imprisoned. You were courageous to brave the depths of Ketheric's stronghold. I suppose you know about Ketheric, then. His invincibility. That we'll never cleanse this place until he's made to bleed. We met him on the road here - commanding an army of the Absolute, intent on destroying Baldur's Gate. I put an arrow through his eye myself, only to watch him pluck it out like a splinter. He healed right in front of me, and chased us into the shadows. Things looked hopeless, but experience has taught me that no matter how bleak things look, there's always hope. You are that hope.\nPlayer: It's rare people look at me and see 'hope'.\nJaheira: The light is rather dim, out here in the shadowlands. The point remains: Protected by your artefact, you can infiltrate his forces at Moonrise Towers, posing as a True Soul. Find out what it is that makes him invincible so we can strip him of his advantage. Once Ketheric is without his shield, the sword: together we assault his tower, and put a final end to this blight.\nPlayer: There's something you should know - Marcus, the Flaming Fist upstairs, is a True Soul. He wants to kidnap Isobel.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Jaheir takes the glass from the table.\nJaheira: This place is crawling with Harpers. If Marcus managed to get himself infected, we would've known the same minute. Is this some kind of test? Or a game, perhaps?\nPlayer: Ignore me, then. It's your own funeral.\nJaheira: I'm not ignoring you - I just see no evidence of your rather outlandish claim. You've come from the shadows and wasted no time accusing one of our companions of treason. It's all a little... odd. A Harper's gaze can only be turned by proof. By the looks of it, a tall tale is all you have to offer.\nPlayer: Jaheira, there's something you need to know: Marcus is a True Soul, and he's planning to kidnap Isobel.\nJaheira: This place is crawling with Harpers. If Marcus managed to get himself infected, we would've known the same minute. Is this some kind of test? Or a game, perhaps?\nPlayer: Absolutely not. Marcus is a danger to you all.\nJaheira: A Harper's gaze can only be turned by proof. By the looks of it, a tall tale is all you have to offer.\nPlayer: And I'll drink to the darkness that will soon fall when I drag Isobel all the way to Moonrise Towers.",

I suppose you know about Ketheric, then. His invincibility. That we'll never cleanse this place until he's made to bleed. We met him on the road here - commanding an army of the Absolute, intent on destroying Baldur's Gate. I put an arrow through his eye myself, only to watch him pluck it out like a splinter.

You are that hope.\nPlayer: I'm trying my best to be...\nJaheira: Protected by your artefact, you can infiltrate his forces at Moonrise Towers, posing as a True Soul.

The cult of the Absolute is spreading through the city - quietly, quickly, and with unsettling deliberation. We tracked them to this ancient village only to be faced with a man we killed and buried over a century ago.\nPlayer: Ketheric Thorm. He and I have history.\nJaheira: You were the one who rescued those the Absolute had imprisoned. You were courageous to brave the depths of Ketheric's stronghold. I suppose you know about Ketheric, then. His invincibility. That we'll never cleanse this place until he's made to bleed. We met him on the road here - commanding an army of the Absolute, intent on destroying Baldur's Gate. I put an arrow through his eye myself, only to watch him pluck it out like a splinter. He healed right in front of me, and chased us into the shadows. Things looked hopeless, but experience has taught me that no matter how bleak things look, there's always hope. You are that hope.\nPlayer: It's rare people look at me and see 'hope'.\nJaheira: The light is rather dim, out here in the shadowlands. The point remains: Protected by your artefact, you can infiltrate his forces at Moonrise Towers, posing as a True Soul. Find out what it is that makes him invincible so we can strip him of his advantage. Once Ketheric is without his shield, the sword: together we assault his tower, and put a final end to this blight.\nPlayer: There's something you should know - Marcus, the Flaming Fist upstairs, is a True Soul. He wants to kidnap Isobel.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Jaheir takes the glass from the table.\nJaheira: This place is crawling with Harpers.

You've come from the shadows and wasted no time accusing one of our companions of treason. It's all a little... odd. A Harper's gaze can only be turned by proof.

The cult of the Absolute is spreading through the city - quietly, quickly, and with unsettling deliberation. We tracked them to this ancient village only to be faced with a man we killed and buried over a century ago.\nPlayer: Ketheric Thorm. He and I have history.\nJaheira: You were the one who rescued those the Absolute had imprisoned. You were courageous to brave the depths of Ketheric's stronghold. I suppose you know about Ketheric, then. His invincibility. That we'll never cleanse this place until he's made to bleed. We met him on the road here - commanding an army of the Absolute, intent on destroying Baldur's Gate. I put an arrow through his eye myself, only to watch him pluck it out like a splinter. He healed right in front of me, and chased us into the shadows. Things looked hopeless, but experience has taught me that no matter how bleak things look, there's always hope. You are that hope.\nPlayer: I'm trying my best to be...\nJaheira: Protected by your artefact, you can infiltrate his forces at Moonrise Towers, posing as a True Soul. Find out what it is that makes him invincible so we can strip him of his advantage. Once Ketheric is without his shield, the sword: together we assault his tower, and put a final end to this blight.\nPlayer: There's something you should know - Marcus, the Flaming Fist upstairs, is a True Soul. He wants to kidnap Isobel.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Jaheir takes the glass from the table.\nJaheira: This place is crawling with Harpers.

Told him to kneel... They took his eyes first. Then his tongue.\nPlayer: Which one was Asharak again?\nAlfira: Which...? Back in the grove, he ran drills with the kids. Wooden swords and the like. That seems like a lifetime ago now. Rolan, of all people, saved us. He said he stayed in the grove because of you, and I'm damn glad of it. Without him... well, none of us would be here.\nPlayer: What did the cultists do to the others?\nAlfira: I don't know. It just... happened so quickly. How do you do it?

Far be it from me of course, to question your tastes.\nPlayer: Actually, I may just want to spend the night with you instead of Wyll.\nGale: Indeed? We had a moment, you and I, a moment in which we expressed the possibility of becoming more than friends. Tonight seems perfectly suited for such endeavours. Allow me to make the following proposition: There's a book that circulates in Amn, detailing the first thousand nights of a newlywed king and queen. They turned everything they did into an art. The art of conversation. The art of taste, time honoured and newly acquired. The art of the body. The exploration and acceptance of the self and the other. The art of the night itself. I say we take a page from their book.\nPlayer: I'll remind you we're newly acquainted, not newlyweds.\nGale: Then we'll start writing the prequel. What do you say?\nPlayer: I'm not sure you're the one I want.\nGale: That's because you've yet to find out what you're missing. Doubt is a spoilsport. Cast it aside.\nPlayer: No. Another time maybe.\nGale: Too bad. One should never be afraid to live life to the fullest. But before you go... I know there are many things about me that remain shrouded in mystery. You've been very patient with me, and I appreciate that. You've given me powerful magic to consume when I needed it most. You've brought me back from the grey shores of death. You know of my condition and its challenges, but those are but the broad strokes. The time has come to paint you the true picture.",

Not an entirely unpromising specimen, for one naturally-born.\nNodeContext: Begrudging and largely hostile, but with a hint of appreciation for the player's skill in actually making it this far.\nBalthazar: Not just any True Soul would have succeeded in following my path through this place. You should be pleased. I take it the breaking of my skeletons was an accident - the living are so clumsy, after all.\nPlayer: I'm pleased to be of service, Balthazar.\nBalthazar: Perhaps you can prove to me that you're more useful alive than dead. You know what's at stake here, I take it? But you're here now, and I may be able to put those limbs to work. You know what's at stake here, I take it?\nPlayer: Judging by how you're cowering in here, your survival?\nBalthazar: I do not cower - I plan. I command. I create. General Thorm trusts me. He knows I will deliver. He knows I will stand by him long after all others wilt and fall. You, Z'rell, all the rest... you have only one body with which to serve. I have as many as I care to make.\nPlayer: As you mention serving Ketheric, he sent you to find a relic, no?\nBalthazar: General Thorm to you. But yes, recovering the relic is the crux of it. He commands, and I, his humble servant, fulfil that command. While you, an infinitely more humble servant, fulfil my command. I will put you to work - as a scout.\nNarrator: *This necromancer has Ketheric's trust. Helping him could be just what you need to gain access to the man himself.*\nPlayer: I need more to go on. Why is this relic so important? What does it do?\nBalthazar: Telling you will not make the task any less perilous. Just obey, and use your ignorance as a shield. You should be adept at that already. The Nightsong lends the General his strength, his invulnerability. It must be recovered, before his enemies attempt to exploit it.\nPlayer: You need my help?\nBalthazar: I do not need you, or your help. But you are here in spite of that, so I may as well make use of you. The relic is close, but the way is barred and Shar's dead are... uncooperative. Clear the path for me - by blade, cunning, or whatever it takes. I will remain here until you have succeeded, or fallen.\nShadowheart: I'd trust this gasbag about as far as I can throw him - which isn't far. But perhaps better to play along, for now.\nPlayer: For jobs like this it's good form to provide your operatives some extra resources.\nBalthazar: Fine. I will assign Flesh to aid you on your way. Ring this bell... ...Hmm. Misplaced, it seems. You will be capable enough without it.\nPlayer: This sounds like your problem, not mine. Keep it - this is your problem, not mine.\nBalthazar: This is not a problem - it is an opportunity. And it is not a choice either - you will obey.\nPlayer: Fine. I'll see what I can do.

This is a night for celebration, not suspicion. I thank you for seeking me out. Amidst all this merriment I wasn't sure we'd have a chance to speak this evening. More's the pity you've already found someone else to make merry with, just the two of you. Lae'zel. Blade like a razor, wit like a razor, tongue like a razor. I do hope you know what you're doing. Far be it from me of course, to question your tastes.\nPlayer: Actually, I may just want to spend the night with you instead of Wyll.\nGale: Indeed? We shared a romantic moment of the mind while cloaked in the Weave, didn't we? And I seem to recall a fond allusion to that moment afterwards. Allow me to make the following proposition: There's a book that circulates in Amn, detailing the first thousand nights of a newlywed king and queen. They turned everything they did into an art. The art of conversation. The art of taste, time honoured and newly acquired. The art of the body. The exploration and acceptance of the self and the other. The art of the night itself. I say we take a page from their book.\nPlayer: Leave it to you to woo someone with a book.\nGale: Forget the book then. Let's be blank slates on blank sheets, delightfully new. What do you say?\nPlayer: I'm not sure you're the one I want.\nGale: That's because you've yet to find out what you're missing. Doubt is a spoilsport. Cast it aside.\nPlayer: No. Another time maybe.\nGale: Too bad. One should never be afraid to live life to the fullest. But before you go... I know there are many things about me that remain shrouded in mystery. You've been very patient with me, and I appreciate that. You've given me powerful magic to consume when I needed it most. You've brought me back from the grey shores of death. You know of my condition, and you know about my unfortunate efforts to win Mystra's favour, but those are but the broad strokes. The time has come to paint you the true picture.",

Someone told them to rot in the Nine Hells, that we weren't going anywhere. Maybe that's why they picked him. Told him to kneel... They took his eyes first. Then his tongue.\nPlayer: Which one was Ikaron again?\nAlfira: Which...? He was on the quiet side, but had a heart of gold. Back in the grove, he'd kept an eye on the kids. Gods, that feels like a lifetime ago. Rolan, of all people, saved us. He said he stayed in the grove because of you, and I'm damn glad of it. Without him... well, none of us would be here.\nPlayer: If he hadn't listened to me, maybe his brother and sister would still be here.\nAlfira: Don't say that.

You should be pleased. I take it the breaking of my skeletons was an accident - the living are so clumsy, after all.\nPlayer: I'm pleased to be of service, Balthazar.\nBalthazar: Perhaps you can prove to me that you're more useful alive than dead. You know what's at stake here, I take it? But you're here now, and I may be able to put those limbs to work. You know what's at stake here, I take it?\nPlayer: Nere mentioned that you were seeking access to the Temple. Looks like you found it.\nBalthazar: Perhaps you'd be more useful dead than alive if you don't even know what I'm seeking here. But you're here now, and I may be able to put those limbs to work. You know what's at stake here, I take it?\nPlayer: Judging by how you're cowering in here, your survival?\nBalthazar: I do not cower - I plan. I command. I create. General Thorm trusts me. He knows I will deliver. He knows I will stand by him long after all others wilt and fall. You and all the rest have only one body with which to serve. I have as many as I care to make. You, Z'rell, all the rest... you have only one body with which to serve. I have as many as I care to make.\nPlayer: As you mention serving Ketheric, he sent you to find a relic, no?\nBalthazar: General Thorm to you. But yes, recovering the relic is the crux of it. He commands, and I, his humble servant, fulfil that command. While you, an infinitely more humble servant, fulfil my command. I will put you to work - as a scout.\nNarrator: *This necromancer has Ketheric's trust. Helping him could be just what you need to gain access to the man himself.*\nPlayer: So you need my help - what would I have to do? What do you need me to do?\nBalthazar: I do not need you, or your help. But you are here in spite of that, so I may as well make use of you. The Nightsong is close, but the way is barred and Shar's dead are... uncooperative. Clear the path for me - by blade, cunning, or whatever it takes. I will remain here until you have succeeded, or fallen.\nShadowheart: I'd trust this gasbag about as far as I can throw him - which isn't far. But perhaps better to play along, for now.\nPlayer: You have resources to spare - give me something to aid my search.\nBalthazar: Fine. I will assign Flesh to aid you on your way. Ring this bell... ...and he will come. My brother is no intellectual powerhouse, but he is strong, loyal and punctual. Should a fight turn against you, remember the bell.\nPlayer: Keep it - this is your problem, not mine.\nBalthazar: This is not a problem - it is an opportunity.

    "conversation": "[description] CinematicNodeContext: Gale takes book out (of his own inventory),\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Player hands book to Gale\nGale: That devil Raphael was telling the truth. There's no doubt - the Crown of Karsus is what's controlling the elder brain. And this - this is no mere journal - it contains Karsus' original plans for the Crown's construction. His designs for godhood.\nPlayer: A design you could follow?\nGale: Not from scratch - unless you happen to have several pounds of the purest Netherese metals in that pack of yours? Don't worry - I'm not asking you to surrender anything else on my account. What's called for here is something altogether different. The book states that the Crown and Netherstones were originally one construct, seemingly sundered at the moment of Karsus' downfall. If we can collect the crown's setting, and the three Netherstones, and with the correct invocation of certain spells and gestures detailed in these notes... I think I could reforge it.\nPlayer: That Crown's caused chaos. We should be seeking a way to destroy it, not make it more powerful.\nGale: Do not mistake the crown itself for the actions of its wearer, or rather, those controlling its wearer at present. If we could restore its former glory, it would no longer be a mere leash and collar, used to subjugate friend or foe. It would be something greater. Something divine. Just think of it... the power of the gods in mortal hands at last. We'd be free of doctrine and dogma, confined only by the limits of our imaginations. I promise you - the gods will never grant us such a blessing, no matter how much we worship and adore them.\nPlayer: You dismiss the entire pantheon so easily. Not all gods are selfish.\nGale: Some gods may delude themselves into believing they care about their worshippers, but when it comes down to it - we're all expendable. Children to be appeased, not respected. I worshipped Mystra loyally for years, and in that time she granted me the barest sliver of the power I was ready to wield. Even with the fate of the world at stake, she had little more to offer me than the means of blowing myself up at a more convenient time. She's done nothing to help us. Mystra wanted the brain obliterated because of this crown. She fears a world in which such power is beyond her control - ready to be claimed by Karsus' successor.\nPlayer: Or to destroy the next wizard who attempts it. The attempt would kill you as it killed Karsus.\nGale: Do you think I had not considered that? I have no intention of repeating his folly. Powerful as he was, Karsus lacked some advantages I can lay claim to. I know Mystra - intimately. And I carry a fragment of the Weave itself within my body. Karsus achieved many things, but he never managed that. A long road lies ahead before the Crown comes into our possession. All I ask for now is that you not dismiss this possibility out of hand. Please - at least think on it.\nPlayer: What you're suggesting is blasphemy. You'd be wise to banish these notions from your head.\nGale: I see. I suppose I am asking you to take a leap of faith even the most loyal of companions might struggle to land gracefully. I've spent so long feeling... inferior, shut out from my destiny over such a simple act of youthful enthusiasm. Perhaps I got carried away with the thought this Crown could give me back what Mystra took. Cure me, even.",

I have as many as I care to make.\nPlayer: As you mention serving Ketheric, he sent you to find a relic, no?\nBalthazar: General Thorm to you. But yes, recovering the relic is the crux of it.

The Nightsong lends the General his strength, his invulnerability. It must be recovered, before his enemies attempt to exploit it.\nPlayer: Sounds like you've good reason to be proud of the Nightsong - tell me more.\nBalthazar: And spoil the surprise? I think not. But let's just say that the Nightsong was a unique specimen even before I began my work... Words - even my words - are woefully insufficient. When you see for yourself, you will understand.\nPlayer: What do you need me to do?\nBalthazar: I do not need you, or your help. But you are here in spite of that, so I may as well make use of you. The relic is close, but the way is barred and Shar's dead are... uncooperative. Clear the path for me - by blade, cunning, or whatever it takes. I will remain here until you have succeeded, or fallen.\nShadowheart: I'd trust this gasbag about as far as I can throw him - which isn't far. But perhaps better to play along, for now.\nPlayer: For jobs like this it's good form to provide your operatives some extra resources.\nBalthazar: Fine. I will assign Flesh to aid you on your way. Ring this bell... ...and he will come. My brother is no intellectual powerhouse, but he is strong, loyal and punctual. Should a fight turn against you, remember the bell.\nPlayer: Keep it - this is your problem, not mine.\nBalthazar: This is not a problem - it is an opportunity.

More's the pity you've already found someone else to make merry with, just the two of you. Lae'zel. Blade like a razor, wit like a razor, tongue like a razor. I do hope you know what you're doing. Far be it from me of course, to question your tastes.\nPlayer: Actually, I may just want to spend the night with you instead of Lae'zel.\nGale: Indeed? We had a moment, you and I, a moment in which we expressed the possibility of becoming more than friends. Tonight seems perfectly suited for such endeavours. Allow me to make the following proposition: There's a book that circulates in Amn, detailing the first thousand nights of a newlywed king and queen. They turned everything they did into an art. The art of conversation. The art of taste, time honoured and newly acquired. The art of the body. The exploration and acceptance of the self and the other. The art of the night itself. I say we take a page from their book.\nPlayer: Let me stop you right there. That's not something I'm interested in.\nGale: Too bad. One should never be afraid to live life to the fullest. But before you go... I know there are many things about me that remain shrouded in mystery. You've been very patient with me, and I appreciate that. I was given powerful magic to consume when I needed it most. You've brought me back from the grey shores of death. You know of my condition, and you know about my unfortunate efforts to win Mystra's favour, but those are but the broad strokes. The time has come to paint you the true picture.",

And now we hold the very tome that could confirm it.\nPlayer: Don't stand on ceremony - see what it says.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Gale takes book out (of his own inventory),\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Player hands book to Gale\nGale: That devil Raphael was telling the truth. There's no doubt - the Crown of Karsus is what's controlling the elder brain. And this - this is no mere journal - it contains Karsus' original plans for the Crown's construction. His designs for godhood.\nPlayer: A design you could follow?\nGale: Not from scratch - unless you happen to have several pounds of the purest Netherese metals in that pack of yours? Don't worry - I'm not asking you to surrender anything else on my account. What's called for here is something altogether different. The book states that the Crown and Netherstones were originally one construct, seemingly sundered at the moment of Karsus' downfall. If we can collect the crown's setting, and the three Netherstones, and with the correct invocation of certain spells and gestures detailed in these notes... I think I could reforge it.\nPlayer: To what end?\nGale: To every end you can imagine, and a thousand more beyond. Just think of it... the power of the gods in mortal hands at last. We'd be free of doctrine and dogma, confined only by the limits of our imaginations. I promise you - the gods will never grant us such a blessing, no matter how much we worship and adore them.\nPlayer: And you think Mystra will let you do this?\nGale: I don't know. Ao does not look kindly on gods meddling in mortal affairs - she may have no choice but to stand by and let events unfold. Even with the fate of the world at stake, she had little more to offer me than the means of blowing myself up at a more convenient time. She's done nothing to help us. Mystra wanted the brain obliterated because of this crown. She fears a world in which such power is beyond her control - ready to be claimed by Karsus' successor.\nPlayer: This is no ordinary artefact, Gale. Do this and you'd challenge the gods themselves.\nGale: Perhaps they deserve to be challenged. Perhaps you and I deserve better than to live and die as their pawns. Ambition is not a sin. To question the powers that rule us is not treason. We must at least try - why wallow in the dirt when we can reach for the stars? A long road lies ahead before the Crown comes into our possession. All I ask for now is that you not dismiss this possibility out of hand. Please - at least think on it.\nPlayer: What you're suggesting is blasphemy. You'd be wise to banish these notions from your head.\nGale: I see. I suppose I am asking you to take a leap of faith even the most loyal of companions might struggle to land gracefully. I've spent so long feeling... inferior, shut out from my destiny over such a simple act of youthful enthusiasm. Perhaps I got carried away with the thought this Crown could give me back what Mystra took. Cure me, even.",

Most monsters will think twice before making a meal of me. An old hunter's trick - if you can't mask your scent, spoil it.\nPlayer: I prefer a weapon to a stench, thanks.\nGandrel: Sharp steel is not proof against all the monsters of this world, my friend. A sharp wit will serve you better, if you're to bargain with the lady of this house. That is why you come to her lair, I take it? To bargain?\nPlayer: My business here is my own.\nGandrel: As you like. But you needn't be coy - whatever's worth knowing, rest assured she already knows it. Her kind have hidden among us since the first darkness - and their knowledge is matched only by their spite. Know how to ask, and they'll share that knowledge. If you're fool enough to pay their price.\nPlayer: What price is that?\nGandrel: Whatever's easiest to lose and hardest to do without. But the thing I hunt has gone to ground. If she can tell me how to draw him out, I'll pay whatever she asks. But she thrives on suffering. Once she hears what awaits my quarry when I catch him, she will help.\nPlayer: Who is it you're hunting?\nGandrel: Truth is like a blade, my friend. We can arm ourselves with it. Or just as easily find it pressed against our throat. I would not put you in danger.\nPlayer: Your coyness is getting boring. Tell me.\nGandrel: You take insult where none is intended, my friend. But fine - I won't add to it. I hunt a vampire spawn called Astarion. I'm bound to bring him back to Baldur's Gate - alive. Though I cannot swear to his condition once my tribe are done with him. Is he known to you?\nPlayer: You can give up your hunt. Astarion's under my protection.\nGandrel: ...I see. Your loyalty is admirable but misplaced. His kind have charm beyond our mortal means to resist. I can show you who he truly is - if you will just tell me where to find him. But you're right - he's no true vampire. Not yet. I don't suppose you'll tell me where he is?\nPlayer: Tell him how to find your camp.",

Alas, I am a simple wanderer. A simple wanderer and monster hunter. But I'm no witchdoctor or cut-throat.\nPlayer: I assume you want to kill the hag?\nAstarion: Or to make a deal with her.

We shared a romantic moment of the mind while cloaked in the Weave, didn't we? And I seem to recall a fond allusion to that moment afterwards. Allow me to make the following proposition: There's a book that circulates in Amn, detailing the first thousand nights of a newlywed king and queen. They turned everything they did into an art. The art of conversation. The art of taste, time honoured and newly acquired. The art of the body. The exploration and acceptance of the self and the other. The art of the night itself.

What do you say?\nPlayer: I'm afraid I have to decline.\nGale: Too bad. One should never be afraid to live life to the fullest. But before you go... I know there are many things about me that remain shrouded in mystery. You've been very patient with me, and I appreciate that. You've given me powerful magic to consume when I needed it most.

And this - this is no mere journal - it contains Karsus' original plans for the Crown's construction. His designs for godhood.\nPlayer: Karsus? Crown? You might need to catch me up a bit...\nGale: Karsus. The child-who-would-become-a-god. He was the most powerful wizard ever known... and he attempted to unseat the goddess of magic herself. Only she used the last of her power to block him from the Weave. His magic faltered. The great flying cities of Netheril plunged from the sky. Karsus' Folly. That goddess of magic was reborn as Mystra. She ruled on, while Netherese magic was reduced to mere fragments of what Karsus once wielded - artefacts, the most powerful of which appears to be his Crown. The book states that the Crown and Netherstones were originally one construct, seemingly sundered at the moment of Karsus' downfall. If we can collect the crown's setting, and the three Netherstones, and with the correct invocation of certain spells and gestures detailed in these notes... I think I could reforge it.\nPlayer: To what end?\nGale: To every end you can imagine, and a thousand more beyond. Just think of it... the power of the gods in mortal hands at last. We'd be free of doctrine and dogma, confined only by the limits of our imaginations. I promise you - the gods will never grant us such a blessing, no matter how much we worship and adore them.\nPlayer: Mortals are far better guardians of their fates than the gods. We have more to lose.\nGale: Then you're already wiser than me. That's a lesson I've only recently learned. I worshipped Mystra loyally for years, and in that time she granted me the barest sliver of the power I was ready to wield. Even with the fate of the world at stake, she had little more to offer me than the means of blowing myself up at a more convenient time. She's done nothing to help us. Mystra wanted the brain obliterated because of this crown. She fears a world in which such power is beyond her control - ready to be claimed by Karsus' successor.\nPlayer: And you believe yourself to be that successor?\nGale: Not until this moment, but I can't help beginning to see such a destiny unfold before me. Powerful as he was, Karsus lacked some advantages I can lay claim to. I know Mystra - intimately. And I carry a fragment of the Weave itself within my body. Karsus achieved many things, but he never managed that. A long road lies ahead before the Crown comes into our possession. All I ask for now is that you not dismiss this possibility out of hand. Please - at least think on it.\nPlayer: What you're suggesting is blasphemy. You'd be wise to banish these notions from your head.\nGale: I see. I suppose I am asking you to take a leap of faith even the most loyal of companions might struggle to land gracefully. I've spent so long feeling... inferior, shut out from my destiny over such a simple act of youthful enthusiasm. Perhaps I got carried away with the thought this Crown could give me back what Mystra took. Cure me, even.",

I take it the breaking of my skeletons was an accident - the living are so clumsy, after all.\nPlayer: I'm pleased to be of service, Balthazar.\nBalthazar: Perhaps you can prove to me that you're more useful alive than dead. You know what's at stake here, I take it? But you're here now, and I may be able to put those limbs to work. You know what's at stake here, I take it?\nPlayer: Judging by how you're cowering in here, your survival?\nBalthazar: I do not cower - I plan. I command. I create. General Thorm trusts me. He knows I will deliver. He knows I will stand by him long after all others wilt and fall. You, Z'rell, all the rest... you have only one body with which to serve. I have as many as I care to make.\nPlayer: As you mention serving Ketheric, he sent you to find a relic, no?\nBalthazar: General Thorm to you. But yes, recovering the relic is the crux of it. He commands, and I, his humble servant, fulfil that command. While you, an infinitely more humble servant, fulfil my command. I will put you to work - as a scout.\nNarrator: *This necromancer has Ketheric's trust. Helping him could be just what you need to gain access to the man himself.*\nPlayer: I need more to go on. Why is this relic so important? What does it do?\nBalthazar: Telling you will not make the task any less perilous. Just obey, and use your ignorance as a shield. You should be adept at that already. The Nightsong lends the General his strength, his invulnerability. It must be recovered, before his enemies attempt to exploit it.\nPlayer: You need my help?\nBalthazar: I do not need you, or your help. But you are here in spite of that, so I may as well make use of you. The Nightsong is close, but the way is barred and Shar's dead are... uncooperative. Clear the path for me - by blade, cunning, or whatever it takes. I will remain here until you have succeeded, or fallen.\nShadowheart: I'd trust this gasbag about as far as I can throw him - which isn't far. But perhaps better to play along, for now.\nPlayer: You have resources to spare - give me something to aid my search.\nBalthazar: Fine. I will assign Flesh to aid you on your way. Ring this bell... ...Hmm. Misplaced, it seems. You will be capable enough without it.\nPlayer: This sounds like your problem, not mine. Keep it - this is your problem, not mine.\nBalthazar: This is not a problem - it is an opportunity. And it is not a choice either - you will obey.\nPlayer: Fine. I'll see what I can do.

The Crown of Karsus. And this - this is no mere journal - it contains Karsus' original plans for the Crown's construction. His designs for godhood.\nPlayer: A design you could follow?\nGale: Not from scratch - unless you happen to have several pounds of the purest Netherese metals in that pack of yours? Don't worry - I'm not asking you to surrender anything else on my account. What's called for here is something altogether different. The book states that the Crown and Netherstones were originally one construct, seemingly sundered at the moment of Karsus' downfall. If we can collect the crown's setting, and the three Netherstones, and with the correct invocation of certain spells and gestures detailed in these notes... I think I could reforge it.\nPlayer: We already know the crown's dangerous. Wouldn't that make things worse?\nGale: Worse? It could be the best thing that ever happened to me. To us. Just think of it... the power of the gods in mortal hands at last. We'd be free of doctrine and dogma, confined only by the limits of our imaginations. I promise you - the gods will never grant us such a blessing, no matter how much we worship and adore them.\nPlayer: Don't dare to assume why I worship. Not all of us share such transactional relationships with our gods.\nGale: But do you not expect something in return for your devotion? Some favour, some stir of courage, some response?

Even with the fate of the world at stake, she had little more to offer me than the means of blowing myself up at a more convenient time. She's done nothing to help us. Mystra wanted the brain obliterated because of this crown. She fears a world in which such power is beyond her control - ready to be claimed by Karsus' successor.\nPlayer: So you want the Crown to settle a score with Mystra?\nGale: She sent me to die. Ambition is not a sin. To question the powers that rule us is not treason. We must at least try - why wallow in the dirt when we can reach for the stars? A long road lies ahead before the Crown comes into our possession. All I ask for now is that you not dismiss this possibility out of hand. Please - at least think on it.\nPlayer: Gale - I'm urging you to drop this. This Crown cannot be reforged.\nGale: I see. I suppose I am asking you to take a leap of faith even the most loyal of companions might struggle to land gracefully. I've spent so long feeling... inferior, shut out from my destiny over such a simple act of youthful enthusiasm. Perhaps I got carried away with the thought this Crown could give me back what Mystra took. Cure me, even.",

You know what's at stake here, I take it?\nPlayer: Z'rell said Ketheric wants you to find a relic. That's all I know. As you mention serving Ketheric, he sent you to find a relic, no?\nBalthazar: General Thorm to you. But yes, recovering the relic is the crux of it. He commands, and I, his humble servant, fulfil that command. While you, an infinitely more humble servant, fulfil my command. I will put you to work - as a scout.\nNarrator: *This necromancer has Ketheric's trust. Helping him could be just what you need to gain access to the man himself.*\nPlayer: Jobs like this always go smoother when I know exactly what I'm looking for. I need more to go on. Why is this relic so important? What does it do?\nBalthazar: Telling you will not make the task any less perilous. Just obey, and use your ignorance as a shield. You should be adept at that already. The Nightsong lends the General his strength, his invulnerability. It must be recovered, before his enemies attempt to exploit it.\nPlayer: Sounds like you've good reason to be proud of the Nightsong - tell me more.\nBalthazar: And spoil the surprise? I think not. But let's just say that the Nightsong was a unique specimen even before I began my work... Words - even my words - are woefully insufficient. When you see for yourself, you will understand.\nPlayer: What do you need me to do?\nBalthazar: I do not need you, or your help. But you are here in spite of that, so I may as well make use of you. The Nightsong is close, but the way is barred and Shar's dead are... uncooperative. Clear the path for me - by blade, cunning, or whatever it takes. I will remain here until you have succeeded, or fallen.\nShadowheart: I'd trust this gasbag about as far as I can throw him - which isn't far. But perhaps better to play along, for now.\nPlayer: For jobs like this it's good form to provide your operatives some extra resources.\nBalthazar: Fine. I will assign Flesh to aid you on your way.

I thank you for seeking me out. Amidst all this merriment I wasn't sure we'd have a chance to speak this evening. More's the pity you've already found someone else to make merry with, just the two of you. Wyll's a good man. He may actually be a tried-and-true storybook hero. Then again he's so full of himself it's a small miracle he hasn't resorted to self-cannibalism yet. Far be it from me of course, to question your tastes.\nPlayer: Actually, I may just want to spend the night with you instead of Wyll.\nGale: Indeed? We had a moment, you and I, a moment in which we expressed the possibility of becoming more than friends. Tonight seems perfectly suited for such endeavours. Allow me to make the following proposition: There's a book that circulates in Amn, detailing the first thousand nights of a newlywed king and queen. They turned everything they did into an art. The art of conversation. The art of taste, time honoured and newly acquired. The art of the body. The exploration and acceptance of the self and the other. The art of the night itself. I say we take a page from their book.\nPlayer: Leave it to you to woo someone with a book.\nGale: Forget the book then. Let's be blank slates on blank sheets, delightfully new. What do you say?\nPlayer: I'm not sure you're the one I want.\nGale: That's because you've yet to find out what you're missing. Doubt is a spoilsport. Cast it aside.\nPlayer: No. Another time maybe.\nGale: Too bad. One should never be afraid to live life to the fullest. But before you go... I know there are many things about me that remain shrouded in mystery. You've been very patient with me, and I appreciate that. You've given me powerful magic to consume when I needed it most. You've brought me back from the grey shores of death. You know of my condition, and you know about my unfortunate efforts to win Mystra's favour, but those are but the broad strokes.

    "conversation": "Gale: If my suspicions are correct, the crown currently perched atop the elder brain may be one of Karsus' design. And now we hold the very tome that could confirm it.\nPlayer: Don't stand on ceremony - see what it says.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Gale takes book out (of his own inventory),\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Player hands book to Gale\nGale: This isn't what I expected... this is much more. The Crown of Karsus. And this - this is no mere journal - it contains Karsus' original plans for the Crown's construction. His designs for godhood.\nPlayer: Stay silent.\nGale: The book states that the Crown and Netherstones were originally one construct, seemingly sundered at the moment of Karsus' downfall. If we can collect the crown's setting, and the three Netherstones, and with the correct invocation of certain spells and gestures detailed in these notes... I think I could reforge it.\nPlayer: That Crown's caused chaos. We should be seeking a way to destroy it, not make it more powerful.\nGale: Do not mistake the crown itself for the actions of its wearer, or rather, those controlling its wearer at present. If we could restore its former glory, it would no longer be a mere leash and collar, used to subjugate friend or foe. It would be something greater. Something divine. Just think of it... the power of the gods in mortal hands at last. We'd be free of doctrine and dogma, confined only by the limits of our imaginations. I promise you - the gods will never grant us such a blessing, no matter how much we worship and adore them.\nPlayer: Mortals are far better guardians of their fates than the gods. We have more to lose.\nGale: Then you're already wiser than me. That's a lesson I've only recently learned. I worshipped Mystra loyally for years, and in that time she granted me the barest sliver of the power I was ready to wield. Even with the fate of the world at stake, she had little more to offer me than the means of blowing myself up at a more convenient time. She's done nothing to help us. Mystra wanted the brain obliterated because of this crown. She fears a world in which such power is beyond her control - ready to be claimed by Karsus' successor.\nPlayer: This is no ordinary artefact, Gale. Do this and you'd challenge the gods themselves.\nGale: Perhaps they deserve to be challenged. Perhaps you and I deserve better than to live and die as their pawns. Ambition is not a sin. To question the powers that rule us is not treason. We must at least try - why wallow in the dirt when we can reach for the stars? A long road lies ahead before the Crown comes into our possession. All I ask for now is that you not dismiss this possibility out of hand. Please - at least think on it.\nPlayer: Gale - I'm urging you to drop this. This Crown cannot be reforged.\nGale: I see. I suppose I am asking you to take a leap of faith even the most loyal of companions might struggle to land gracefully. I've spent so long feeling... inferior, shut out from my destiny over such a simple act of youthful enthusiasm. Perhaps I got carried away with the thought this Crown could give me back what Mystra took. Cure me, even.",

There's no doubt - the Crown of Karsus is what's controlling the elder brain. And this - this is no mere journal - it contains Karsus' original plans for the Crown's construction. His designs for godhood.\nPlayer: Karsus? Crown? You might need to catch me up a bit...\nGale: Karsus. The child-who-would-become-a-god. He was the most powerful wizard ever known... and he attempted to unseat the goddess of magic herself. Only she used the last of her power to block him from the Weave. His magic faltered. The great flying cities of Netheril plunged from the sky. Karsus' Folly. That goddess of magic was reborn as Mystra. She ruled on, while Netherese magic was reduced to mere fragments of what Karsus once wielded - artefacts, the most powerful of which appears to be his Crown. The book states that the Crown and Netherstones were originally one construct, seemingly sundered at the moment of Karsus' downfall. If we can collect the crown's setting, and the three Netherstones, and with the correct invocation of certain spells and gestures detailed in these notes... I think I could reforge it.\nPlayer: To what end?\nGale: To every end you can imagine, and a thousand more beyond. Just think of it... the power of the gods in mortal hands at last. We'd be free of doctrine and dogma, confined only by the limits of our imaginations. I promise you - the gods will never grant us such a blessing, no matter how much we worship and adore them.\nPlayer: Mortals are far better guardians of their fates than the gods. We have more to lose.\nGale: Then you're already wiser than me. That's a lesson I've only recently learned. I worshipped Mystra loyally for years, and in that time she granted me the barest sliver of the power I was ready to wield. Even with the fate of the world at stake, she had little more to offer me than the means of blowing myself up at a more convenient time. She's done nothing to help us. Mystra wanted the brain obliterated because of this crown. She fears a world in which such power is beyond her control - ready to be claimed by Karsus' successor.\nPlayer: So you want the Crown to settle a score with Mystra?\nGale: She sent me to die. Ambition is not a sin. To question the powers that rule us is not treason. We must at least try - why wallow in the dirt when we can reach for the stars? A long road lies ahead before the Crown comes into our possession. All I ask for now is that you not dismiss this possibility out of hand. Please - at least think on it.\nPlayer: Gale - I'm urging you to drop this. This Crown cannot be reforged.\nGale: I see. I suppose I am asking you to take a leap of faith even the most loyal of companions might struggle to land gracefully. I've spent so long feeling... inferior, shut out from my destiny over such a simple act of youthful enthusiasm. Perhaps I got carried away with the thought this Crown could give me back what Mystra took. Cure me, even.",

Good manners, however, all beings can aspire to. I suggest you find yours before dealing with the lady of this house. A sharp wit will serve you better, if you're to bargain with the lady of this house. That is why you come to her lair, I take it? To bargain?\nPlayer: Are you talking about Auntie Ethel?\nGandrel: A gentle name. But I speak of her nature. Her kind have hidden among us since the first darkness - and their knowledge is matched only by their spite. Know how to ask, and they'll share that knowledge. If you're fool enough to pay their price.\nPlayer: Speak for yourself - I got what I wanted.\nGandrel: So said the fish 'round the hook in its mouth. But, one fool to another, I can't say I judge you. The thing I hunt has slipped away from me. If she can tell me how to flush him out, I'll pay whatever price she asks. But she thrives on suffering. Once she hears what awaits my quarry when I catch him, she will help.\nPlayer: Who is it you're hunting?\nGandrel: Truth is like a blade, my friend. We can arm ourselves with it. Or just as easily find it pressed against our throat. I would not put you in danger.\nPlayer: There's enough deception in this place - don't add to it.\nGandrel: It is not everyone who can see past her parlour tricks. As you wish - the truth is not mine to keep. I hunt a vampire spawn called Astarion. I'm bound to bring him back to Baldur's Gate - alive. Though I cannot swear to his condition once my tribe are done with him. Is he known to you?\nPlayer: You're wasting your time. Astarion's been dealt with.\nGandrel: You know him? Not too well, I think, if you believe he is so easily slain. He could be stalking your camp at this very moment. Perhaps you could tell me where to look, and I could ensure peace of mind for us both? But you're right - he's no true vampire. Not yet. I don't suppose you'll tell me where he is?\nPlayer: Tell him how to find your camp.",

You've brought me back from the grey shores of death. You know of my condition, and you know about my unfortunate efforts to win Mystra's favour, but those are but the broad strokes.

If the crown atop the elder brain was truly forged by Karsus himself, this book will confirm it. All we have to do is turn the page... If my suspicions are correct, the crown currently perched atop the elder brain may be one of Karsus' design. And now we hold the very tome that could confirm it.\nPlayer: Don't stand on ceremony - see what it says.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Gale takes book out (of his own inventory),\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Player hands book to Gale\nGale: That devil Raphael was telling the truth. There's no doubt - the Crown of Karsus is what's controlling the elder brain. And this - this is no mere journal - it contains Karsus' original plans for the Crown's construction. His designs for godhood.\nPlayer: Karsus? Crown? You might need to catch me up a bit...\nGale: Karsus. The child-who-would-become-a-god. He was the most powerful wizard ever known... and he attempted to unseat the goddess of magic herself. Only she used the last of her power to block him from the Weave. His magic faltered. The great flying cities of Netheril plunged from the sky. Karsus' Folly. That goddess of magic was reborn as Mystra. She ruled on, while Netherese magic was reduced to mere fragments of what Karsus once wielded - artefacts, the most powerful of which appears to be his Crown. The book states that the Crown and Netherstones were originally one construct, seemingly sundered at the moment of Karsus' downfall. If we can collect the crown's setting, and the three Netherstones, and with the correct invocation of certain spells and gestures detailed in these notes... I think I could reforge it.\nPlayer: That Crown's caused chaos. We should be seeking a way to destroy it, not make it more powerful.\nGale: Do not mistake the crown itself for the actions of its wearer, or rather, those controlling its wearer at present. If we could restore its former glory, it would no longer be a mere leash and collar, used to subjugate friend or foe. It would be something greater. Something divine. Just think of it... the power of the gods in mortal hands at last. We'd be free of doctrine and dogma, confined only by the limits of our imaginations. I promise you - the gods will never grant us such a blessing, no matter how much we worship and adore them.\nPlayer: You dismiss the entire pantheon so easily. Not all gods are selfish.\nGale: Some gods may delude themselves into believing they care about their worshippers, but when it comes down to it - we're all expendable. Children to be appeased, not respected. I worshipped Mystra loyally for years, and in that time she granted me the barest sliver of the power I was ready to wield. Even with the fate of the world at stake, she had little more to offer me than the means of blowing myself up at a more convenient time. She's done nothing to help us. Mystra wanted the brain obliterated because of this crown. She fears a world in which such power is beyond her control - ready to be claimed by Karsus' successor.\nPlayer: And you believe yourself to be that successor?\nGale: Not until this moment, but I can't help beginning to see such a destiny unfold before me. Powerful as he was, Karsus lacked some advantages I can lay claim to. I know Mystra - intimately. And I carry a fragment of the Weave itself within my body. Karsus achieved many things, but he never managed that. A long road lies ahead before the Crown comes into our possession. All I ask for now is that you not dismiss this possibility out of hand. Please - at least think on it.\nPlayer: Gale - I'm urging you to drop this. This Crown cannot be reforged.\nGale: I see. I suppose I am asking you to take a leap of faith even the most loyal of companions might struggle to land gracefully. I've spent so long feeling... inferior, shut out from my destiny over such a simple act of youthful enthusiasm. Perhaps I got carried away with the thought this Crown could give me back what Mystra took. Cure me, even.",

    "conversation": "Gale: The Annals of Karsus... The preamble to a civilisation's downfall, committed to parchment by the very hand that wrought its destruction. If the crown atop the elder brain was truly forged by Karsus himself, this book will confirm it. All we have to do is turn the page... If my suspicions are correct, the crown currently perched atop the elder brain may be one of Karsus' design. And now we hold the very tome that could confirm it.\nPlayer: Don't stand on ceremony - see what it says.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Gale takes book out (of his own inventory),\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Player hands book to Gale\nGale: This isn't what I expected... this is much more. The Crown of Karsus. And this - this is no mere journal - it contains Karsus' original plans for the Crown's construction. His designs for godhood.\nPlayer: Karsus? Crown? You might need to catch me up a bit...\nGale: Karsus. The child-who-would-become-a-god. He was the most powerful wizard ever known... and he attempted to unseat the goddess of magic herself. Only she used the last of her power to block him from the Weave. His magic faltered. The great flying cities of Netheril plunged from the sky. Karsus' Folly. That goddess of magic was reborn as Mystra. She ruled on, while Netherese magic was reduced to mere fragments of what Karsus once wielded - artefacts, the most powerful of which appears to be his Crown. The book states that the Crown and Netherstones were originally one construct, seemingly sundered at the moment of Karsus' downfall. If we can collect the crown's setting, and the three Netherstones, and with the correct invocation of certain spells and gestures detailed in these notes... I think I could reforge it.\nPlayer: You 'think'? What happens if you fail?\nGale: Well, there'd be risk in such an endeavour, but only proportionate to the reward.\nNodeContext: Doesn't want to get bogged down by doubts like these\nGale: Just think of it... the power of the gods in mortal hands at last. We'd be free of doctrine and dogma, confined only by the limits of our imaginations. I promise you - the gods will never grant us such a blessing, no matter how much we worship and adore them.\nPlayer: Mortals are far better guardians of their fates than the gods. We have more to lose.\nGale: Then you're already wiser than me. That's a lesson I've only recently learned. I worshipped Mystra loyally for years, and in that time she granted me the barest sliver of the power I was ready to wield. Even with the fate of the world at stake, she had little more to offer me than the means of blowing myself up at a more convenient time. She's done nothing to help us. Mystra wanted the brain obliterated because of this crown. She fears a world in which such power is beyond her control - ready to be claimed by Karsus' successor.\nPlayer: I thought you were past this kind of temptation, Gale. You know exactly where such over-reaching leads.\nGale: Neither of us can know what truly may be if we don't at least try. Potential is nothing in itself - just a fleeting dream, unless we drag it into the waking world. Please, at least think on it. Powerful as he was, Karsus lacked some advantages I can lay claim to. I know Mystra - intimately. And I carry a fragment of the Weave itself within my body. Karsus achieved many things, but he never managed that. A long road lies ahead before the Crown comes into our possession. All I ask for now is that you not dismiss this possibility out of hand. Please - at least think on it.\nPlayer: Gale - I'm urging you to drop this. This Crown cannot be reforged.\nGale: I see. I suppose I am asking you to take a leap of faith even the most loyal of companions might struggle to land gracefully. I've spent so long feeling... inferior, shut out from my destiny over such a simple act of youthful enthusiasm. Perhaps I got carried away with the thought this Crown could give me back what Mystra took. Cure me, even.",

If you're fool enough to pay their price.\nPlayer: What price is that?\nGandrel: Whatever's easiest to lose and hardest to do without. But the thing I hunt has gone to ground.

The preamble to a civilisation's downfall, committed to parchment by the very hand that wrought its destruction. If the crown atop the elder brain was truly forged by Karsus himself, this book will confirm it. All we have to do is turn the page... If my suspicions are correct, the crown currently perched atop the elder brain may be one of Karsus' design. And now we hold the very tome that could confirm it.\nPlayer: Don't stand on ceremony - see what it says.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Gale takes book out (of his own inventory),\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Player hands book to Gale\nGale: That devil Raphael was telling the truth. There's no doubt - the Crown of Karsus is what's controlling the elder brain. And this - this is no mere journal - it contains Karsus' original plans for the Crown's construction. His designs for godhood.\nPlayer: Karsus? Crown? You might need to catch me up a bit...\nGale: Karsus. The child-who-would-become-a-god. He was the most powerful wizard ever known... and he attempted to unseat the goddess of magic herself. Only she used the last of her power to block him from the Weave. His magic faltered. The great flying cities of Netheril plunged from the sky. Karsus' Folly. That goddess of magic was reborn as Mystra. She ruled on, while Netherese magic was reduced to mere fragments of what Karsus once wielded - artefacts, the most powerful of which appears to be his Crown. The book states that the Crown and Netherstones were originally one construct, seemingly sundered at the moment of Karsus' downfall. If we can collect the crown's setting, and the three Netherstones, and with the correct invocation of certain spells and gestures detailed in these notes... I think I could reforge it.\nPlayer: Aren't you forgetting something? We have to hand the Crown to Raphael...\nGale: A situation I suggest we remedy with the utmost urgency. I promise you - the power such an item would give us is worth transcending all nine Hells for. The heavens too, while we're at it.\nNodeContext: Gleam in his eyes, excitement\nGale: Just think of it... the power of the gods in mortal hands at last. We'd be free of doctrine and dogma, confined only by the limits of our imaginations. I promise you - the gods will never grant us such a blessing, no matter how much we worship and adore them.\nPlayer: Mortals are far better guardians of their fates than the gods. We have more to lose.\nGale: Then you're already wiser than me. That's a lesson I've only recently learned. I worshipped Mystra loyally for years, and in that time she granted me the barest sliver of the power I was ready to wield. Even with the fate of the world at stake, she had little more to offer me than the means of blowing myself up at a more convenient time. She's done nothing to help us. Mystra wanted the brain obliterated because of this crown. She fears a world in which such power is beyond her control - ready to be claimed by Karsus' successor.\nPlayer: Or to destroy the next wizard who attempts it. The attempt would kill you as it killed Karsus.\nGale: Do you think I had not considered that? I have no intention of repeating his folly. Powerful as he was, Karsus lacked some advantages I can lay claim to. I know Mystra - intimately. And I carry a fragment of the Weave itself within my body. Karsus achieved many things, but he never managed that. A long road lies ahead before the Crown comes into our possession. All I ask for now is that you not dismiss this possibility out of hand. Please - at least think on it.\nPlayer: Gale - I'm urging you to drop this. This Crown cannot be reforged.\nGale: I see. I suppose I am asking you to take a leap of faith even the most loyal of companions might struggle to land gracefully. I've spent so long feeling... inferior, shut out from my destiny over such a simple act of youthful enthusiasm. Perhaps I got carried away with the thought this Crown could give me back what Mystra took. Cure me, even.",

    "conversation": "[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) We see the Surgeon stand by a table upon which a wriggling human lies strapped down in an X position. Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon‚Äôs voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar. See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy. Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human‚Äôs belly, but it‚Äôs a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace. Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver. Come. Step forward. You are no sister, but that matters none. Every student is welcome.\nPlayer: In my experience, torture is usually more pain and less proselytising.\nMalus Thorm: Behold, sisters, the very face of ignorance - one who mistakes tenderness for torture. Go on. Acquaint the face of ignorance with the true object of our studies.\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly. It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nKarlach: What the fuck is this loon talking about.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being? If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: But you: look how the succour of Shar eludes even you, one who walks faithfully in her shadow. See how painfully present you remain... We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: Your subject is tainted. Shar's succour must only be granted to the willing.\nMalus Thorm: Hmmm. 'Only the willing may know the Lady's embrace.' You know her teachings well. And yet, these sisters must exercise their gifts, for the art of absence lies in its execution. How to proceed, I wonder.\nPlayer: Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\nMalus Thorm: Yes... For are we not all in need of a cure? The scalpel does not discriminate. Let each and every one of you partake in its soothing journey. Absence, sisters. Acquaint yourselves.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) Screaming and slashing, the sisters brutally murder each other.\nMalus Thorm: It is a proud moment when one sees one's teachings so lovingly taken to heart. You are to be commended for their graduation - rewarded with the promised cure. Come, I will acquaint you with the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nPlayer: My magic has blinded me - I see now that Shar is the only path. Show me how - I beg of you. I would rather acquaint myself - if you show me how.\nMalus Thorm: Your diligence is exemplary. Very well: your own scalpel you will be. Observe - then succeed me, into the succour of Shar.",

Your journey here was a hard one, no doubt.\n Is this your first time in Baldur's Gate?\nPlayer: Yes. I'm almost entirely sure I'm a Baldurian.\nGROUP_Act3_WYR_OrinsImpersonation_FlamingFist: It's a fine city, isn't it? No better place to hail from. Used to be you'd arrive knowing you'd a full belly and a warm bed waiting for you. Not any more. These days, there's barely enough to go around. Add the refugees on top and... well, folk aren't feeling too generous.\nPlayer: Sounds like that's your problem, not mine.\nGROUP_Act3_WYR_OrinsImpersonation_FlamingFist: If it were my problem, I'd do something about it. Instead they've stuck me guarding this door while they squabble over the donations. Some well-to-do's in the city donated enough to see the newcomers right for the time being. Only they didn't bother helping everyone else. Locals going without while strangers feast - it's stoked the fire, all right. Some Baldurians are kicking up a fuss round the front of the barn as we speak. If I wasn't wearing this uniform, I'd walk round there and teach them a lesson they'd never forget.\nPlayer: If the refugees have more than they need, it's only fair they give some back.\nGROUP_Act3_WYR_OrinsImpersonation_FlamingFist: Too bloody right. But will they share? Not a chance. Those refugees have been leeching on our city for too long. If we don't show them we mean business, they'll bleed us dry.

One should cherish all of nature's bounty... but goblin guts are quite far down the list.\nNodeContext: Hint of wry humour, Introducing himself after transforming from an owlbear and killing several goblins.\nHalsin: Not only do you speak with a bear, but you free it, too? A true friend of nature - or perhaps a lunatic. Either way, I owe thanks. I am the druid Halsin.\nPlayer: Glad I could be of help.\nHalsin: I must admit, I didn't expect anyone would come to my aid. Who in their right mind would infiltrate a goblin infested temple. Unless... ...Hrrm. That look in your eyes - I've seen it before. Are you feeling all right?\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Halsin raises a hand to your head, magically connecting with you (no contact). He gives an alarmed look - he knows what‚Äôs inside you\nHalsin: Oak Father preserve you, child... You're infected, aren't you? The mind flayers' spawn. But... something's different. You're aware of the monster inside you. You don't bow to the Absolute, like the True Souls do... How is this possible...?\nPlayer: I think this artefact has something to do with it.\nHalsin: Hmmm... that looks very alien. As alien as the mind flayers. They do not belong on this world. It's no coincidence that you found me here, I'll wager? You're after a cure for this parasite. I've been studying these parasites for a while now. Ever since I discovered these so-called True Souls are infected with them. Someone is using very powerful magic to modify these tadpoles. They are using them to exert control over the infected. I'm sorry to say, I can't undo that magic, which means I can't cure you. But that doesn't mean I can't help. I didn't find what I came here for - a way to remove the tadpoles - but I found the next best thing. I found out where they come from. That must be where these enchantments are placed on them, and it's where you'll find your cure.\nPlayer: You learned all this from your studies?\nHalsin: Indeed. After we dealt with the drow that ambushed us, Nettie and I were able to inspect the corpse - and the creature that slithered out of it. I had no idea anyone beyond their ranks was infected. You have my sincere sympathies.\nPlayer: This magic you mentioned - it isn't normal for these parasites? What should I do?\nHalsin: I overheard that the cultists are sending all of their captives to Moonrise Towers. Innocents go in, True Souls come out. Given that all of these True Souls are infected, it has to be the source of this magic. If you want to find a cure, you must head there and discover how the tadpoles are being manipulated.\nPlayer: You seem to know a lot about this. Will you come with me to Moonrise?\nHalsin: I wish I could, but there's still work I've yet to finish - blood I've yet to spill. I've no right to ask more of you... but if you could help me, I'd be free to join your journey to Moonrise. I cannot allow these butchers to threaten my grove. The natural order must be protected.\nPlayer: The other druids are dead, by my hand.\nHalsin: What...? How? Why?! Explain yourself at once!\nPlayer: They left me no choice. I had to defend myself.\nHalsin: Then... then it is as you say. They forgot their principles; you had no choice. I will mourn them when I can. But there are other matters to attend to before that. Chaos is welcome, in doses; it helps keep balance. But this is too much - this is unnatural. It's too late to merely kill this horde's leadership - their forces are already marching. If you want me to help, you need to help me first. You must get ahead of them, muster the defences.\nPlayer: Very well. I'll go rescue the grove.",

The cost must be paid.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Flames ignite Mizora and her two companions. Mizora's voice echos outward as if amplified by the Hells themselves.\nMizora: Wyll Ravengard. A choice is before you. Option one. I show you the way to your father. I guarantee him no harm except that from you and your allies. And you pledge your soul to me and the archdevil Zariel in a pact eternal. Option two. I break your pact, and you are freed from your duty. Your father dies by his enemy's hand, and Baldur's Gate loses its greatest champion. Name your sacrifice.\nKarlach: Bloody Zariel.

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon‚Äôs voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar. See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy. Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human‚Äôs belly, but it‚Äôs a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace. Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver. Come. Step forward. I can see the love of Shar darken your eyes. Be welcome.\nPlayer: May Shar guide your blessing hands.\nMalus Thorm: And the rough vessels that are yours. Tell me, what is the guiding principle of the goddess?\nPlayer: Forgetfulness.\nMalus Thorm: I profess there is another more profound.\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly. It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nWyll: Hells. Only a monster would inflict misery and call it medicine.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being? If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: But you: look how the succour of Shar eludes even you, one who walks faithfully in her shadow. See how painfully present you remain... We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: The goddess has greater plans for me than to submit to your scalpels.\nMalus Thorm: Another absence is your fate? But if you are not here to be cured, how will my sisters learn? Their incisions are, as yet, still streaked with imprecision - that much I must concede. How to steady their hands, I wonder.\nPlayer: I take joy in performing with a master of my craft - I'm sure the sisters are the same. Why don't you volunteer? In my years of study, I have found no better teacher than example. Perhaps you could volunteer?\nMalus Thorm: I see now. By example I must edify and quell the light that blinds us.",

Hells, you might be the only one who can stop this. What else do you know?\nPlayer: Father has shown me visions - the Temple of Bhaal lurks somewhere in the city.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: So it's all happening again... just like in Sarevok's time... A century ago, Bhaal bred dozens just like you. One of whom was Sarevok Anchev. The Bhaal cult is back, and someone is out there, continuing Sarevok's work.\nPlayer: You're absolutely right. I have reasons of my own to think there's been an increase in Bhaalist activity.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: Good. Then your eyes are open to the truth. The brutality of the killings is on a par with Sarevok's own. But there's something more here, something new... There's a reverence to these murders, a certain flair. It's as if they were done in worship. The precision of the cuts, the depth, the execution - the best butchers in Faer√ªn couldn't make a cut like that. Trust me, I've asked them. I've done everything I can within the remit of my job. Any more, and they'll fire me. But you - you're not bound by such constraints. Help me out, here. Help the city out.

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon‚Äôs voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar. See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy. Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human‚Äôs belly, but it‚Äôs a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace. Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver. Come. Step forward. You are no sister, but that matters none. Every student is welcome.\nPlayer: In my experience, torture is usually more pain and less proselytising.\nMalus Thorm: Behold, sisters, the very face of ignorance - one who mistakes tenderness for torture. Go on. Acquaint the face of ignorance with the true object of our studies.\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly. It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nGale: Gods, what living nightmare is this?\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being? If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: But you: look how the succour of Shar eludes you. See how painfully present you remain... We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: Their blades are uneven. Efficient surgery will require further training.\nMalus Thorm: Their incisions are, as yet, still streaked with imprecision - that much I must concede. How to steady their hands, I wonder.\nPlayer: Sparring is vital to progress. Have them practice on each other. Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\nMalus Thorm: Yes... For are we not all in need of a cure? The scalpel does not discriminate. Let each and every one of you partake in its soothing journey. Absence, sisters. Acquaint yourselves.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) Screaming and slashing, the sisters brutally murder each other.\nMalus Thorm: It is a proud moment when one sees one's teachings so lovingly taken to heart. You are to be commended for their graduation - rewarded with the promised cure. Come, I will acquaint you with the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nPlayer: I am but a fumbling squire before a master swordsman. Please, demonstrate so that I might learn. I would rather acquaint myself - if you show me how.\nMalus Thorm: Your diligence is exemplary. Very well: your own scalpel you will be. Observe - then succeed me, into the succour of Shar.",

You weren't speaking lightly when you said you needed help. Let me tell you what I know. I've been studying these parasites for a while now. Ever since I discovered these so-called True Souls are infected with them. Someone is using very powerful magic to modify these tadpoles. They are using them to exert control over the infected. I'm sorry to say, I can't undo that magic, which means I can't cure you. But that doesn't mean I can't help. I didn't find what I came here for - a way to remove the tadpoles - but I found the next best thing. I found out where they come from. That must be where these enchantments are placed on them, and it's where you'll find your cure.\nPlayer: How did you come to study mind flayer parasites?\nHalsin: A drow forced me to defend myself. Afterwards, I was able to study the parasite that slithered out of the corpse, see what drives these 'True Souls'. I had no idea anyone beyond their ranks was infected. You have my sincere sympathies.\nPlayer: Sympathies won't help me to survive.\nHalsin: Patience. I can't just snap my fingers... but I know where the solution almost certainly lies. I overheard that the cultists are sending all of their captives to Moonrise Towers. Innocents go in, True Souls come out. Given that all of these True Souls are infected, it has to be the source of this magic. If you want to find a cure, you must head there and discover how the tadpoles are being manipulated.\nPlayer: Altered parasites? A cure at Moonrise Towers, maybe? Sounds like guesswork at best.\nHalsin: I'm as certain as I can be. If you have a better alternative, I won't stop you. I can't stop you, in fact. Which brings me to my next problem... I've no right to ask more of you... but if you could help me, I'd be free to join your journey to Moonrise. I cannot allow these butchers to threaten my grove. The natural order must be protected.\nPlayer: The other druids are dead, by my hand.\nHalsin: What...? How? Why?! Explain yourself at once!\nPlayer: They left me no choice. I had to defend myself.\nHalsin: Then... then it is as you say. They forgot their principles; you had no choice. I will mourn them when I can. But there are other matters to attend to before that. Chaos is welcome, in doses; it helps keep balance. But this is too much - this is unnatural. It's too late to merely kill this horde's leadership - their forces are already marching. If you want me to help, you need to help me first. You must get ahead of them, muster the defences.\nPlayer: Very well. I'll go rescue the grove.",

Now I wonder if it wasn't the other way around. Kill the Gondians, and you kill all we love: Collaboration. Challenge. Solving problems with the power of reason, creativity, and invention. I still want to believe you're better than that, Wulbren. But even I am having my doubts.\nPlayer: There's no honour among thieves, Barcus - and same goes for the Ironhands. Take Wulbren's place, lead them yourself! Perhaps the Ironhand Gnomes need a new leader. What say you, Barcus?",

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand.

See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy. Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human‚Äôs belly, but it‚Äôs a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace. Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver. Come. Step forward. I can see the love of Shar darken your eyes. Be welcome.\nPlayer: May Shar guide your blessing hands.\nMalus Thorm: And the rough vessels that are yours. Tell me, what is the guiding principle of the goddess?\nPlayer: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Precisely. Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly. It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nLae'zel: Only a beast of a man toys with his victim. Entertaining, if not efficient.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being? If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: But you: look how the succour of Shar eludes even you, one who walks faithfully in her shadow. See how painfully present you remain... We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: The sisters aren't ready. They'll make me sick instead of curing me.\nMalus Thorm: Their incisions are, as yet, still streaked with imprecision - that much I must concede. How to steady their hands, I wonder.\nPlayer: I have read your treatise. Initiate the final lesson, or die by my hand.\nMalus Thorm: The final lesson. Yes. For to teach absence, one must become absent. I see now. By example I must edify and quell the light that blinds us.",

Risen Road's more dangerous than ever. You're the first friendly face we've seen since Elturgard.\nPlayer: Elturgard's a long way from here. Where are you heading?\nRugan: We're bound for Baldur's Gate - got some cargo to deliver. But we've a stop to make along the way.\nPlayer: Where's that?\nRugan: Waukeen's Rest. It's just up the road. I'd be enjoying a mug of ale right now if those beasts hadn't jumped us. Listen. You look like you know how to handle yourself. You should meet my associates. We've got our own drinking spot by the tavern - invitation only. Tell the fellow on the door 'little serpent, long shadow'. He'll take good care of you.\nOlly: Rugan!\nRugan: It's fine. We'd be dead if they hadn't showed up. A little hospitality won't do any harm.\nPlayer: What's in the chest? Your cargo?\nRugan: Aye. The whole reason we're in this mess. Trinkets for some rich tosser in Baldur's Gate.

This is the point when a clever operator like you accepts my gratitude and walks away.\nPlayer: You're missing a golden opportunity. Report the cargo lost - and we can sell it ourselves. You'll find I'm very persuasive. We can make much more coin than you would with your employers.\nRugan: Coin ain't any use to the dead. And dead's what I'll be if I welch on this deal.

    "conversation": "Gale: Even in such fraught times as these, there is peace to be found in the stillness as evening draws in. I used to while away many hours just like these with my companion, though in far comfier surrounds. She preferred it when we were alone, curled up before a crackling hearth with some ancient, esoteric tome between us, ink glinting in the firelight...\nPlayer: I hope you aren't talking about Mystra again...\nGale: I speak of Tara, my tressym, assistant, my constant companion through all the ills and tribulations my hubris has thrust upon me. She'd be most impressed by our efforts saving these tieflings. Proud, even. And I've given her little to be proud of recently. After I was afflicted with my condition, I locked myself in my tower for an entire year. I was inconsolable, wallowing in my self-inflicted tragedy. I'd given up on myself, but Tara never did. It was her encouragement, her research that led me to my treatment. Once we knew that magically-infused items were the key, she went out to find them for me. She saved my life. After so long being cared for by someone else, it feels good to have repaid the favour. Not directly to Tara, but to these poor tieflings. I'm sure she would approve.\nPlayer: She must be very smart, to have done all that.\nGale: 'Smart' does her a disservice. She's a fine wizard in her own right, though somewhat held back by her lack of opposable thumbs. You remind me of her somewhat. There's a steeliness to you, an unwavering tenacity even in the face of, to be frank, quite dire odds. I wish she were here for me to make a formal introduction, but I would never ask her to undertake such a journey. She is safer at home. Besides, she was always telling me I needed to spread my wings, so to speak. Find mortal friends, instead of hanging onto Mystra's coattails. So that's what I'm doing. I hope.\nPlayer: What if she doesn't like me?\nGale: She'll love you. So long as you don't rub her belly. She hates it when anyone does that.\nPlayer: Not as much as I hate talking about cats. Is there nothing else on your mind?\nGale: Not an animal lover? Nobody's perfect, I suppose. Nonetheless, your finer qualities are remarkably plentiful. Suffice it to say, I think rather a lot of you. And there aren't many on this plane who I'd give such high praise.\nPlayer: I'm flattered. Is your good opinion so hard to come by?\nGale: One doesn't become the most powerful archmage in Waterdeep and lover to the goddess of magic herself by having low standards. I assure you, when I tell someone they're wonderful - I mean it. And you are wonderful. I think you're rather wonderful. And that's not a word I waste on anyone unworthy of it.\nPlayer: The feeling's mutual - you're a wonderful friend. Though usually more... erudite.",

Whatever your business, I'd see to it quickly - the druids are forcing everyone out. This attack will only strengthen their resolve.\nPlayer: Those goblins - have there been many attacks like that?\nZevlor: There have been several attacks by different monsters. The druids blame us 'outsiders' for drawing them here. Nobody's welcome anymore. They've started a ritual to cut the grove off from the world outside. We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: What brought you here?\nZevlor: We're refugees from Elturel - we took shelter here after gnolls attacked us on the road. We were bound for Baldur's Gate, and it was too late to turn back. Elturel had no place for tieflings after the Descent.\nPlayer: 'The Descent'? What is that?\nZevlor: I'm surprised you haven't heard of it. The High Overseer - our grand protector - signed a pact with devils. It dragged Elturel straight to Hell. Lucky for us, a group of adventurers found a way to bring the city back. Afterwards, people looked at us and just saw 'devilkin'. No different from the druids here, really. We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: What brought you here?\nZevlor: We're refugees from Elturel - we took shelter here after gnolls attacked us on the road.

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon‚Äôs voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar. See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy. Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human‚Äôs belly, but it‚Äôs a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace. Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver. Come. Step forward. You are no sister, but that matters none. Every student is welcome.\nPlayer: I am a scholar, this is true - just not in the study of torture.\nMalus Thorm: Behold, sisters, the very face of ignorance - one who mistakes tenderness for torture. Go on. Acquaint the face of ignorance with the true object of our studies.\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly. It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nLae'zel: Only a beast of a man toys with his victim. Entertaining, if not efficient.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being? If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: But you: look how the succour of Shar eludes you. See how painfully present you remain... We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: Your subject is tainted. Shar's succour must only be granted to the willing.\nMalus Thorm: Hmmm. 'Only the willing may know the Lady's embrace.' You know her teachings well. And yet, these sisters must exercise their gifts, for the art of absence lies in its execution. How to proceed, I wonder.\nPlayer: Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\nMalus Thorm: Yes... For are we not all in need of a cure? The scalpel does not discriminate. Let each and every one of you partake in its soothing journey. Absence, sisters. Acquaint yourselves.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) Screaming and slashing, the sisters brutally murder each other.\nMalus Thorm: It is a proud moment when one sees one's teachings so lovingly taken to heart. You are to be commended for their graduation - rewarded with the promised cure. Come, I will acquaint you with the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nPlayer: I would rather acquaint myself - if you show me how.\nMalus Thorm: Your diligence is exemplary. Very well: your own scalpel you will be. Observe - then succeed me, into the succour of Shar.",

Though I'm afraid that's all the welcome we can give you. Whatever your business, I'd see to it quickly - the druids are forcing everyone out. This attack will only strengthen their resolve.\nPlayer: Why are they forcing you out?\nZevlor: There have been several attacks by different monsters. The druids blame us 'outsiders' for drawing them here. Nobody's welcome anymore. They've started a ritual to cut the grove off from the world outside. We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: What brought you here?\nZevlor: We're refugees from Elturel - we took shelter here after gnolls attacked us on the road. We were bound for Baldur's Gate, and it was too late to turn back. Elturel had no place for tieflings after the Descent.\nPlayer: That's sad - but it doesn't mean the druids owe you sanctuary.\nZevlor: It seems you're of a mind with our hosts here. But their ritual will force you out, too. We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: This ritual - is there no way to convince the druids to stop it?\nZevlor: I've tried. Kagha - their new First Druid - won't even see me. You, though... I know it's not your business, but she owes you for saving this place. Perhaps you could persuade her.

Another who needs to learn the difference between right and wrong?\n\nEsther the expeditioner: S_GLO_Expeditioner_5f4048ba-72ef-43c2-9528-1c9a12f3f82f\nNarrator: *A githyanki youth, and a familiar one at that. Can it be that this is the one who hatched from the egg you took from the cr√®che?*\nPlayer: A githyanki? What are you doing down here?\nPtaris: I am not a githyanki. Do not call me that! I am Ptaris. And I am good. Father was bad. They all were. I tried to make them better, but they were not strong enough. They lacked resolve.\nPlayer: So you killed them?\nPtaris: It is not my fault they died. I was only upholding father's code. Even he was not strong enough to follow it. He was not righteous. He was not innocent. His thoughts were impure. Such evil can only be cured one way. With pain. With torment. And if that does not work - with death. Tell me - are you a good person?\nPlayer: I try not to look at things as good or evil. Life is a mixture of both.\nPtaris: There is no 'try'. You are either good or you are not. The Ptarian Code must be obeyed. This is the only way to be sure. Do you follow it?\nPlayer: The Ptarian code? Then you follow the teachings of Bahamut?\nPtaris: The purest of your rulers. But you are nothing like him. You are tainted. I know what you did to me. I see the memory of it, right there in your head. You stole me from my people. Gave me to that woman. Unhatched, defenceless. You let me be brought here so father could hurt me.\nLae'zel: A githyanki raised in isolation. His blood boils like his kin's, but their ways are foreign.\nPtaris: You are bad. You must be taught a lesson.\nNodeContext: Like this is the onyl reasonable conclusion\nPlayer: I thought I was saving you. I had no idea what they were planning. You would have been destroyed if not for me. I saved you.\nPtaris: You were trying to save me? I - I don't understand. Father saved me. I was a nasty, evil thing, but his treatments made me good. I - I'm cured.",

    "conversation": "Havkelaag: Well met. What can the Society of Brilliance do for you? Tell me, what can the Society do for you?\nPlayer: I met an expeditioner claiming to work for you. She sought a githyanki egg.\nHavkelaag: Yes, dear Lady Esther. One of our most reliable contractors, though unfortunately this particular request was too much even for her. I believe she quite lost her senses over the task. She came here insisting I purchase an owlbear egg from her, of all things. I don't suppose you've stumbled across any githyanki eggs during your travels? The Society will compensate you for any we purchase, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54]) Would you consider parting with it? The Society's coffers are deep enough to cover any expenses accrued in its retrieval, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: Chk. Don't you dare consider it.\nPlayer: What are you going to do with it?\nHavkelaag: Study it, of course. The githyanki have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months. You yourself have no doubt experienced the prejudice of those who assume that, as beings of the Underdark, we are inherently evil. The githyanki face similar prejudice, but I believe, if hatched in a less violent, more intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome its evil predispositions. I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: So the child inside will be experimented on?\nHavkelaag: Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue. Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: You would teach the child virtue, but rear it without patience. Curious.\nHavkelaag: Tell me, then, philosopher - if patience delays the fostering of the other virtues, can it be rightly called virtuous?\nPlayer: Patience does not delay, it simply tempers virtue. Curtails it from excess.\nHavkelaag: A cautious, hesitant instinct. One I am afraid we do not have time for. My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: Sounds pointless. Public opinion will hardly be swayed by such a small experiment.\nHavkelaag: Not at first. But if the experiment proves successful, it must be repeated. Only then will we know if the findings are to be trusted. Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg? ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: A gith hatchling is not a lab rat! This shka'keth should be bled dry for the mere suggestion.\nPlayer: This experiment is barbaric. You're never getting the egg.",

She preferred it when we were alone, curled up before a crackling hearth with some ancient, esoteric tome between us, ink glinting in the firelight...\nPlayer: Who are you referring to? A former lover, perhaps?\nGale: I speak of Tara, my tressym, assistant, my constant companion through all the ills and tribulations my hubris has thrust upon me. She'd be proud to see me keeping such fine company - the saviour of those poor tieflings, no less. And I've given her precious little to be proud of recently. She has a good heart, and she would recognise the same in your actions here. I'm sure she'd approve of me lending myself to your efforts.

I see your reputation is well earned...\nNarrator: *Barely a breath of confusion, before he sees you through your borrowed guise.*\nLorroakan: My - could it be? Gale of Waterdeep, here in my tower. I'm surprised you dare show your face after Mystra cast you on the scrap heap. Well don't stand on ceremony - out with it.\nPlayer: I seek a certain rare tome - concerning Karsus.\nLorroakan: You're quite in luck, then - see Tolna downstairs. One such tome is amongst our rarest books. But enough of dusty history - I look to the future. You know I seek the Nightsong. Do you have it or not?\nPlayer: What do you want with her?\nLorroakan: 'She'. Then you do know her. You've been to Shar's temple. To the Shadowfell. You've looked upon the Nightsong's face. Tell me - and choose your next words carefully - where is she now?\nPlayer: Be careful what you wish for. She'll eat you alive.\nLorroakan: I'm growing tired of this repartee, my friend. Let us cut to the chase. Beautiful, isn't it? Worth more than your life, too. I bought it from a Calishite warlock with very little of his soul left to him. It can bind a celestial to the wearer's service with a snap of the fingers. And this? This can keep her in place. Forever.\nPlayer: I know where she is. I might even be willing to tell you.\nShadowheart: That was more than he strictly needed to know. You're not intending to surrender her over to him, are you...?\nNightwarden Minthara: Surrendering a powerful ally to this preening wizard does not seem wise. I have little affection for Nightsong, but I would have less for you if you gave her up without a fight.\nLorroakan: Good. Then you'll have no trouble fulfilling the contract to bring the Nightsong here.\nPlayer: Why do you want her so badly?\nLorroakan: I'm growing tired of this repartee, my friend.

This is the point when a clever operator like you accepts my gratitude and walks away.\nPlayer: You're missing a golden opportunity. Report the cargo lost - and we can sell it ourselves. You'll find I'm very persuasive. We can make much more coin than you would with your employers.\nRugan: I like the way you think. Didn't expect to turn this horrorshow to my advantage... but why not? The chest's all yours. Damn thing's sealed tighter than a Duke's pursestrings, so there's no point in trying to open it. I know a fence in Baldur's Gate who'll take it off your hands. Nobody will be the wiser. Don't try to cut me out of the deal though. The Black Network has eyes and blades everywhere. Crafty swine like you could make a name for yourself in the Zhentarim.

Good manners, however, all beings can aspire to. I suggest you find yours before dealing with the lady of this house. A sharp wit will serve you better, if you're to bargain with the lady of this house. That is why you come to her lair, I take it? To bargain?\nPlayer: 'The lady of this house'?\nGandrel: A more innocent name than some I could call her. But it is what she is that ought to concern you. Her kind have hidden among us since the first darkness - and their knowledge is matched only by their spite. Know how to ask, and they'll share that knowledge. If you're fool enough to pay their price.\nPlayer: I know Ethel - that sounds nothing like her.\nGandrel: I hope this Ethel is waiting for you when you walk through that door. But I suspect you'll find something else. But the thing I hunt has gone to ground. If she can tell me how to draw him out, I'll pay whatever she asks. But she thrives on suffering. Once she hears what awaits my quarry when I catch him, she will help.\nPlayer: Who is it you're hunting?\nGandrel: Truth is like a blade, my friend. We can arm ourselves with it. Or just as easily find it pressed against our throat. I would not put you in danger.\nPlayer: I like danger. The truth - now.\nGandrel: Perhaps I was... hasty with my words. I hunt a vampire spawn called Astarion. I'm bound to bring him back to Baldur's Gate - alive. Though I cannot swear to his condition once my tribe are done with him. Is he known to you?\nPlayer: You're wasting your time. Astarion's been dealt with.\nGandrel: You know him? Not too well, I think, if you believe he is so easily slain. He could be stalking your camp at this very moment. Perhaps you could tell me where to look, and I could ensure peace of mind for us both? But you're right - he's no true vampire. Not yet. I don't suppose you'll tell me where he is?\nPlayer: I'm not going to help you find him. Back off.",

But don't you worry about Mol - it goes without saying she still has the unconditional freedom to choose the only option she has left. Besides, I do enjoy being in this neighbourhood again.

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon‚Äôs voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar. See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy. Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human‚Äôs belly, but it‚Äôs a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace. Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver. Come. Step forward. You are no sister, but that matters none. Every student is welcome.\nPlayer: You will stop this sick spectacle at once.\nMalus Thorm: Sick. Quite. But on the cusp of a cure:\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly. It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nAstarion: He's just like Cazador - utterly insane.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being? If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: But you: look how the succour of Shar eludes even you, one who walks faithfully in her shadow. See how painfully present you remain... We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: Their blades are uneven. Efficient surgery will require further training.\nMalus Thorm: Their incisions are, as yet, still streaked with imprecision - that much I must concede. How to steady their hands, I wonder.\nPlayer: Sparring is vital to progress. Have them practice on each other. Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\nMalus Thorm: Yes... For are we not all in need of a cure? The scalpel does not discriminate. Let each and every one of you partake in its soothing journey. Absence, sisters. Acquaint yourselves.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) Screaming and slashing, the sisters brutally murder each other.\nMalus Thorm: It is a proud moment when one sees one's teachings so lovingly taken to heart. You are to be commended for their graduation - rewarded with the promised cure. Come, I will acquaint you with the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nPlayer: You do me an honour, but I am not worthy. Show me the way of Shar - I beg of you. I would rather acquaint myself - if you show me how.\nMalus Thorm: Your diligence is exemplary. Very well: your own scalpel you will be. Observe - then succeed me, into the succour of Shar.",

    "conversation": "Havkelaag: Tell me, what can the Society do for you?\nPlayer: I met an expeditioner claiming to work for you. She sought a githyanki egg.\nHavkelaag: Yes, dear Lady Esther. One of our most reliable contractors, though unfortunately this particular request was too much even for her. I believe she quite lost her senses over the task. She came here insisting I purchase an owlbear egg from her, of all things. I don't suppose you've stumbled across any githyanki eggs during your travels? The Society will compensate you for any we purchase, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54]) Would you consider parting with it? The Society's coffers are deep enough to cover any expenses accrued in its retrieval, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: Chk. Don't you dare consider it.\nPlayer: What are you going to do with it?\nHavkelaag: Study it, of course. Your kind have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months. Most on this plane believe you to be innately cruel, violent beings. Evil, if you will. As citizens of the Underdark, we face similar stigmas. Totally unfounded, of course - our natures are as unfixed as any who walk the surface. I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: You assume my people are evil, yet your research is built on sheer superstition.\nHavkelaag: Enough of your kind have wreaked destruction on this plane for me to be confident in my assertion. When I have a suitable sample for my study, I will, however, prove that the effects of their biological inclination are reversible. Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue. Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: So you, too, follow the teachings of Bahamut. Why him?\nHavkelaag: In my years of study, they're the closest I've found to moral perfection. Only under such rigorous 'goodness' will the subject stand a chance of being cured. My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: No benefit could justify you inflicting such cruelty.\nHavkelaag: Rigorous experimental methods demand we do not indulge our own emotional responses in the application of discomfort to our subjects. Only by the full, uninhibited application of psionic stimuli will we have a true measure of whether the child's innate evil has been cured. Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg? ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: A gith hatchling is not a lab rat! This shka'keth should be bled dry for the mere suggestion.\nPlayer: This experiment is barbaric. You're never getting the egg.",

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon‚Äôs voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar. See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy. Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human‚Äôs belly, but it‚Äôs a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace. Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver. Come. Step forward. I can see the love of Shar darken your eyes. Be welcome.\nPlayer: May Shar guide your blessing hands.\nMalus Thorm: And the rough vessels that are yours.

What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being? If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: But you: look how the succour of Shar eludes even you, one who walks faithfully in her shadow. See how painfully present you remain... We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: The sisters aren't ready. They'll make me sick instead of curing me.\nMalus Thorm: Their incisions are, as yet, still streaked with imprecision - that much I must concede. How to steady their hands, I wonder.\nPlayer: Sparring is vital to progress. Have them practice on each other. Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\nMalus Thorm: Yes... For are we not all in need of a cure? The scalpel does not discriminate. Let each and every one of you partake in its soothing journey. Absence, sisters. Acquaint yourselves.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) Screaming and slashing, the sisters brutally murder each other.\nMalus Thorm: It is a proud moment when one sees one's teachings so lovingly taken to heart. You are to be commended for their graduation - rewarded with the promised cure. Come, I will acquaint you with the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nPlayer: I am but a fumbling squire before a master swordsman. Please, demonstrate so that I might learn.

I am Ptaris. And I am good. Father was bad. They all were. I tried to make them better, but they were not strong enough. They lacked resolve.\nPlayer: What did they do that was so terrible?\nPtaris: They did not live up to father's code. Even he did not follow it correctly. He was not righteous. He was not innocent. His thoughts were impure. Such evil can only be cured one way. With pain. With torment. And if that does not work - with death. Tell me - are you a good person?\nPlayer: I fight, eat, drink, love, and hate with everything I have - that is all that matters.\nPtaris: Such an empty and  meaningless life. The Ptarian Code must be obeyed. This is the only way to be sure. Do you follow it?\nPlayer: I live by my own code, though not the one you speak of.\nPtaris: Then your code is flawed. Your actions cannot be defended. I know what you did to me. I see the memory of it, right there in your head. You stole me from my people. Gave me to that woman. Unhatched, defenceless. You let me be brought here so father could hurt me.\nLae'zel: A githyanki raised in isolation. His blood boils like his kin's, but their ways are foreign.\nPtaris: You are bad. You must be taught a lesson.\nNodeContext: Like this is the onyl reasonable conclusion\nPlayer: I never should have saved you. But I'm happy to rectify my mistake. You would have been destroyed if not for me. I saved you.\nPtaris: You were trying to save me? I - I don't understand. Father saved me. I was a nasty, evil thing, but his treatments made me good.

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon‚Äôs voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar. See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy. Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human‚Äôs belly, but it‚Äôs a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace. Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver. Come. Step forward. You are no sister, but that matters none. Every student is welcome.\nPlayer: In my experience, torture is usually more pain and less proselytising.\nMalus Thorm: Behold, sisters, the very face of ignorance - one who mistakes tenderness for torture. Go on. Acquaint the face of ignorance with the true object of our studies.\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly. It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nWyll: Hells. Only a monster would inflict misery and call it medicine.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being? If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: But you: look how the succour of Shar eludes even you, one who walks faithfully in her shadow. See how painfully present you remain... We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: The sisters aren't ready. They'll make me sick instead of curing me.\nMalus Thorm: Their incisions are, as yet, still streaked with imprecision - that much I must concede. How to steady their hands, I wonder.\nPlayer: Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\nMalus Thorm: Yes... For are we not all in need of a cure? The scalpel does not discriminate.

You are here to help me, and not to sacrifice me, aren't you?\nPlayer: Show her the target list. Say nothing of your intentions.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: I'm glad you're on the right side of this, Bhaalspawn. You could be invaluable, if you can get on the inside. Hells, you might be the only one who can stop this. What else do you know?\nPlayer: I was hoping you could tell me more.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: Most of what I know is based on reading into Sarevok's history. I'm sure it's nothing next to your personal experience, but I'll share what I have. A century ago, Bhaal bred dozens just like you. One of whom was Sarevok Anchev. For most, that was the end of it. But cults like that don't disappear overnight. That list you spoke of confirms I'm right. The Bhaal cult is back, and someone is out there, continuing Sarevok's work.\nPlayer: Not only is the cult back, it's spreading fast. I ran into some Bhaalists in the park.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: No doubt you found a trail of bodies in their wake? The brutality of the killings is on a par with Sarevok's own. But there's something more here, something new... There's a reverence to these murders, a certain flair. It's as if they were done in worship. The precision of the cuts, the depth, the execution - the best butchers in Faer√ªn couldn't make a cut like that. Trust me, I've asked them. I've done everything I can within the remit of my job. Any more, and they'll fire me. But you - you're not bound by such constraints. Help me out, here. Help the city out. Follow the trail of these murders. Prove the truth. Use your lineage to get places the Fist can't. I'll bet if you follow the trail of these murders, you'll be able to unearth the truth of this resurgence.\nPlayer: I'm going to stop my Father, whatever it takes.",

Though I never felt alone with a book in my hand. Or with her for company. I speak of Tara, my tressym, assistant, my constant companion through all the ills and tribulations my hubris has thrust upon me. She'd be proud to see me keeping such fine company - the saviour of those poor tieflings, no less. And I've given her precious little to be proud of recently.

You remind me of her somewhat. You share her pragmatic streak. I wish she were here for me to make a formal introduction, but I would never ask her to undertake such a journey. She is safer at home.

The preamble to a civilisation's downfall, committed to parchment by the very hand that wrought its destruction. If the crown atop the elder brain was truly forged by Karsus himself, this book will confirm it. All we have to do is turn the page... If my suspicions are correct, the crown currently perched atop the elder brain may be one of Karsus' design. And now we hold the very tome that could confirm it.\nPlayer: Don't stand on ceremony - see what it says.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Gale takes book out (of his own inventory),\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Player hands book to Gale\nGale: This isn't what I expected... this is much more. The Crown of Karsus. And this - this is no mere journal - it contains Karsus' original plans for the Crown's construction. His designs for godhood.\nPlayer: How did such a powerful object end up in the hands of the Absolute?\nGale: I haven't the foggiest. No doubt through some nefarious means - the crown's existence had been consigned to legend centuries ago. The book states that the Crown and Netherstones were originally one construct, seemingly sundered at the moment of Karsus' downfall. If we can collect the crown's setting, and the three Netherstones, and with the correct invocation of certain spells and gestures detailed in these notes... I think I could reforge it.\nPlayer: You 'think'? What happens if you fail?\nGale: Well, there'd be risk in such an endeavour, but only proportionate to the reward.\nNodeContext: Doesn't want to get bogged down by doubts like these\nGale: Just think of it... the power of the gods in mortal hands at last. We'd be free of doctrine and dogma, confined only by the limits of our imaginations. I promise you - the gods will never grant us such a blessing, no matter how much we worship and adore them.\nPlayer: And you think Mystra will let you do this?\nGale: I don't know. Ao does not look kindly on gods meddling in mortal affairs - she may have no choice but to stand by and let events unfold. Even with the fate of the world at stake, she had little more to offer me than the means of blowing myself up at a more convenient time. She's done nothing to help us. Mystra wanted the brain obliterated because of this crown. She fears a world in which such power is beyond her control - ready to be claimed by Karsus' successor.\nPlayer: I thought you were past this kind of temptation, Gale. You know exactly where such over-reaching leads.\nGale: Neither of us can know what truly may be if we don't at least try. Potential is nothing in itself - just a fleeting dream, unless we drag it into the waking world. Please, at least think on it. Powerful as he was, Karsus lacked some advantages I can lay claim to. I know Mystra - intimately. And I carry a fragment of the Weave itself within my body. Karsus achieved many things, but he never managed that. A long road lies ahead before the Crown comes into our possession. All I ask for now is that you not dismiss this possibility out of hand. Please - at least think on it.\nPlayer: You're a convincing man, Gale. The crown sounds promising.",

She's a fine wizard in her own right, though somewhat held back by her lack of opposable thumbs. You remind me of her somewhat. There's a steeliness to you, an unwavering tenacity even in the face of, to be frank, quite dire odds. I wish she were here for me to make a formal introduction, but I would never ask her to undertake such a journey. She is safer at home. Besides, she was always telling me I needed to spread my wings, so to speak. Find mortal friends, instead of hanging onto Mystra's coattails. So that's what I'm doing. I hope.\nPlayer: What if she doesn't like me?\nGale: She'll love you. So long as you don't rub her belly. She hates it when anyone does that.\nPlayer: Not as much as I hate talking about cats. Is there nothing else on your mind?\nGale: Not an animal lover? Nobody's perfect, I suppose. Nonetheless, your finer qualities are remarkably plentiful. Suffice it to say, I think rather a lot of you. And there aren't many on this plane who I'd give such high praise.\nPlayer: Being mentioned in the same breath as your pet isn't the compliment you think it is...\nGale: Then let me say it more plainly - I think you're rather wonderful. And that's not a word I waste on anyone unworthy of it.\nPlayer: Don't stop now. What else do you like about me?\nGale: Were I to recite that list, I fear we'd still be here at dusk tomorrow. Many things, I assure you, but a conversation better saved for another time. Perhaps we'd better leave it at that. My ineloquent tongue isn't worthy of your ear at present. With my condition as volatile as it is, I fear any undue, er, excitement, may tip it over the edge. So to speak. Go - enjoy your evening. Nothing better for the heart than a good night's rest, and mine is gladdened to know I'll have the pleasure of your company again come morning.",

I used to while away many hours just like these with my companion, though in far comfier surrounds. She preferred it when we were alone, curled up before a crackling hearth with some ancient, esoteric tome between us, ink glinting in the firelight...\nPlayer: Are you... are you talking about your cat?\nGale: By Ahghairon's lost nose - no! Tara is not any cat. She's a tressym. And given your confusion, I'm guessing you've never met one. They're brilliant creatures - fine company for any self-respecting wizard. I speak of Tara, my tressym, assistant, my constant companion through all the ills and tribulations my hubris has thrust upon me. She'd be most impressed by our efforts saving these tieflings. Proud, even. And I've given her little to be proud of recently. After I was afflicted with my condition, I locked myself in my tower for an entire year.

There's no doubt - the Crown of Karsus is what's controlling the elder brain. And this - this is no mere journal - it contains Karsus' original plans for the Crown's construction. His designs for godhood.\nPlayer: The design for self-destruction, more like. Didn't this crown kill Karsus?\nGale: Not exactly. It was what he did with it that sealed his fate, and for a time, that of magic itself. The Crown was merely the means. The book states that the Crown and Netherstones were originally one construct, seemingly sundered at the moment of Karsus' downfall. If we can collect the crown's setting, and the three Netherstones, and with the correct invocation of certain spells and gestures detailed in these notes... I think I could reforge it.\nPlayer: Aren't you forgetting something? We have to hand the Crown to Raphael...\nGale: A situation I suggest we remedy with the utmost urgency. I promise you - the power such an item would give us is worth transcending all nine Hells for. The heavens too, while we're at it.\nNodeContext: Gleam in his eyes, excitement\nGale: Just think of it... the power of the gods in mortal hands at last.

Even with the fate of the world at stake, she had little more to offer me than the means of blowing myself up at a more convenient time. She's done nothing to help us. Mystra wanted the brain obliterated because of this crown. She fears a world in which such power is beyond her control - ready to be claimed by Karsus' successor.\nPlayer: Or to destroy the next wizard who attempts it. The attempt would kill you as it killed Karsus.\nGale: Do you think I had not considered that? I have no intention of repeating his folly. Powerful as he was, Karsus lacked some advantages I can lay claim to. I know Mystra - intimately. And I carry a fragment of the Weave itself within my body. Karsus achieved many things, but he never managed that. A long road lies ahead before the Crown comes into our possession. All I ask for now is that you not dismiss this possibility out of hand.

It's a view I would once have shared with my companion. Though definitely unaccompanied by such revelry. She preferred it when we were alone, curled up before a crackling hearth with some ancient, esoteric tome between us, ink glinting in the firelight...\nPlayer: Who are you referring to? A former lover, perhaps?\nGale: I speak of Tara, my tressym, assistant, my constant companion through all the ills and tribulations my hubris has thrust upon me. She'd be proud to see me keeping such fine company - the saviour of those poor tieflings, no less. And I've given her precious little to be proud of recently. She has a good heart, and she would recognise the same in your actions here. I'm sure she'd approve of me lending myself to your efforts. After so long being cared for by someone else, it feels good to have repaid the favour. Not directly to Tara, but to these poor tieflings. I'm sure she would approve.\nPlayer: What is Tara like?\nGale: 'Smart' does her a disservice. She's a fine wizard in her own right, though somewhat held back by her lack of opposable thumbs. You remind me of her somewhat. You share her pragmatic streak. I wish she were here for me to make a formal introduction, but I would never ask her to undertake such a journey. She is safer at home. Besides, she was always telling me I needed to spread my wings, so to speak. Find mortal friends, instead of hanging onto Mystra's coattails. So that's what I'm doing. I hope.\nPlayer: She sounds like a fine animal. One I'd be honoured to know.\nGale: She'll love you. So long as you don't rub her belly. She hates it when anyone does that.\nPlayer: Do you like having your belly rubbed?\nGale: The pleasures I experienced in Mystra's embrace go far beyond the thrill of having one's tummy tickled. I remember once, she took the smallest piece of the Weave and made it into - Wait. Are you saying... You know what, I think I've clearly had far too much wine. And you've had nowhere near enough. I think this is a conversation best held back on - for now. With my condition as volatile as it is, I fear any undue, er, excitement, may tip it over the edge. So to speak. Go - enjoy your evening. Nothing better for the heart than a good night's rest, and mine is gladdened to know I'll have the pleasure of your company again come morning.",

I allowed myself to get carried away, and failed to properly explain myself.\nPlayer: Apologies are useless if you're still intent on doing something dangerous.\nGale: When are we not doing something dangerous? Give me a chance - I think I can help you understand. Words alone are not enough. Permit me to show you. Please, close your eyes a moment.\nPlayer: Close your eyes.\nGale: Astra navigabimus.\nNodeContext: Latin spellcasting - ass-tra navi-gah-mus ('we sail the stars')\nGale: Few mortals ever glimpse what you're about to see. But don't be alarmed - I'm here with you. Now... open your eyes.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Fade up from black as the player opens their eyes to a dazzling spectacle. They and Gale are now sitting in a small boat that shimmers with iridescent light. Unpiloted, it silently meanders through a majestic, infinite starfield.\nGale: The Outer Planes. This is where gods dwell. Where they observe us from afar. Where they make play-things of us. They would keep all of this from us - the power, the possibilities. They only want us to serve them, pray to them... and ultimately, die for them. But what if we didn't need them? What if we wielded their power instead, and helped ourselves in all the ways they refuse to. I could make that happen. I could make this illusion a reality, with you by my side.\nPlayer: You're still determined to do this, after all that was said?\nGale: How could I not crave this? But I don't want it for myself, alone - I want you at my side, willing and wholehearted. The tadpoles, the orb - these threats to our existence - the gods could aid us if they wished, but instead they cower behind Ao. So let us act ourselves.\nNodeContext: Ao = AY-oh (an overlord deity that most gods answer to)\nGale: With the power of the crown, any foe would be rendered impotent. Any obstacle would be dwarfed by our might. I used to believe Mystra's forgiveness was worth dying for. But I was wrong. You showed me just how much I have to live for. With you, I forget my goddess. I love you. Tell me you feel the same way. Tell me you want what I want. Please.\nPlayer: I don't know what to say.\nGale: Say yes. But if words fail you, I'll accept a kiss. You mean... you want the same as I do?\nNodeContext: Hope rising again\nPlayer: Yes. I want you to seize the crown, and make us a new world.\nGale: I've never wanted to kiss you more than I do now.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Player and Gale are seated facing each other but do not lean in to kiss.\nGale: You put the stars to shame.

The preamble to a civilisation's downfall, committed to parchment by the very hand that wrought its destruction. If the crown atop the elder brain was truly forged by Karsus himself, this book will confirm it. All we have to do is turn the page... If my suspicions are correct, the crown currently perched atop the elder brain may be one of Karsus' design. And now we hold the very tome that could confirm it.\nPlayer: Don't stand on ceremony - see what it says.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Gale takes book out (of his own inventory),\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Player hands book to Gale\nGale: This isn't what I expected... this is much more. The Crown of Karsus. And this - this is no mere journal - it contains Karsus' original plans for the Crown's construction. His designs for godhood.\nPlayer: How did such a powerful object end up in the hands of the Absolute?\nGale: I haven't the foggiest. No doubt through some nefarious means - the crown's existence had been consigned to legend centuries ago. The book states that the Crown and Netherstones were originally one construct, seemingly sundered at the moment of Karsus' downfall. If we can collect the crown's setting, and the three Netherstones, and with the correct invocation of certain spells and gestures detailed in these notes... I think I could reforge it.\nPlayer: Aren't you forgetting something? We have to hand the Crown to Raphael...\nGale: A situation I suggest we remedy with the utmost urgency. I promise you - the power such an item would give us is worth transcending all nine Hells for. The heavens too, while we're at it.\nNodeContext: Gleam in his eyes, excitement\nGale: Just think of it... the power of the gods in mortal hands at last. We'd be free of doctrine and dogma, confined only by the limits of our imaginations. I promise you - the gods will never grant us such a blessing, no matter how much we worship and adore them.\nPlayer: Mortals are far better guardians of their fates than the gods. We have more to lose.\nGale: Then you're already wiser than me. That's a lesson I've only recently learned. I worshipped Mystra loyally for years, and in that time she granted me the barest sliver of the power I was ready to wield. Even with the fate of the world at stake, she had little more to offer me than the means of blowing myself up at a more convenient time. She's done nothing to help us. Mystra wanted the brain obliterated because of this crown. She fears a world in which such power is beyond her control - ready to be claimed by Karsus' successor.\nPlayer: This is no ordinary artefact, Gale. Do this and you'd challenge the gods themselves.\nGale: Perhaps they deserve to be challenged. Perhaps you and I deserve better than to live and die as their pawns. Ambition is not a sin. To question the powers that rule us is not treason. We must at least try - why wallow in the dirt when we can reach for the stars? A long road lies ahead before the Crown comes into our possession. All I ask for now is that you not dismiss this possibility out of hand. Please - at least think on it.\nPlayer: You're a convincing man, Gale. The crown sounds promising.",

More's the pity you've already found someone else to make merry with, just the two of you. Wyll's a good man. He may actually be a tried-and-true storybook hero.

Far be it from me of course, to question your tastes.\nPlayer: Actually, I may just want to spend the night with you instead of Wyll.\nGale: Indeed? We had a moment, you and I, a moment in which we expressed the possibility of becoming more than friends. Tonight seems perfectly suited for such endeavours. Allow me to make the following proposition: There's a book that circulates in Amn, detailing the first thousand nights of a newlywed king and queen. They turned everything they did into an art. The art of conversation. The art of taste, time honoured and newly acquired. The art of the body. The exploration and acceptance of the self and the other. The art of the night itself. I say we take a page from their book.\nPlayer: Leave it to you to woo someone with a book.\nGale: Forget the book then. Let's be blank slates on blank sheets, delightfully new.

    "conversation": "Gale: A beautiful night, don't you think? Nothing like a brush with destruction to make one appreciate the majesty of the celestial canvas. It's a view I would once have shared with my companion. Though definitely unaccompanied by such revelry. She preferred it when we were alone, curled up before a crackling hearth with some ancient, esoteric tome between us, ink glinting in the firelight...\nPlayer: I hope you aren't talking about Mystra again...\nGale: I speak of Tara, my tressym, assistant, my constant companion through all the ills and tribulations my hubris has thrust upon me. She'd be most impressed by our efforts saving these tieflings. Proud, even. And I've given her little to be proud of recently. After I was afflicted with my condition, I locked myself in my tower for an entire year. I was inconsolable, wallowing in my self-inflicted tragedy. I'd given up on myself, but Tara never did. It was her encouragement, her research that led me to my treatment. Once we knew that magically-infused items were the key, she went out to find them for me. She saved my life. After so long being cared for by someone else, it feels good to have repaid the favour. Not directly to Tara, but to these poor tieflings. I'm sure she would approve.\nPlayer: What is Tara like?\nGale: 'Smart' does her a disservice. She's a fine wizard in her own right, though somewhat held back by her lack of opposable thumbs. You remind me of her somewhat. An expression you both share - when she gives in to her more feline qualities, a mouse trapped beneath her paw... I wish she were here for me to make a formal introduction, but I would never ask her to undertake such a journey. She is safer at home. Besides, she was always telling me I needed to spread my wings, so to speak. Find mortal friends, instead of hanging onto Mystra's coattails. So that's what I'm doing. I hope.\nPlayer: You don't have any friends?\nGale: Sadly not. If I'm being entirely honest, my social circle is rather small. More of a dot. Or a pinhead. I've got aquaintances, certainly. Plenty of colleagues. But friends? Those are precious indeed. I hope, though we've only known each other for a short time, I might be able to count you among that number?\nPlayer: Friends with the mighty Gale of Waterdeep? I'd be honoured.\nGale: I'm glad. To know you enjoy my company is, well, it's rather wonderful actually. I'd be loathe to waste the time of someone who's become rather important to me. I think you're rather wonderful. And that's not a word I waste on anyone unworthy of it.\nPlayer: Don't stop now. What else do you like about me?\nGale: Were I to recite that list, I fear we'd still be here at dusk tomorrow. Many things, I assure you, but a conversation better saved for another time. Perhaps we'd better leave it at that. My ineloquent tongue isn't worthy of your ear at present. With my condition as volatile as it is, I fear any undue, er, excitement, may tip it over the edge. So to speak. Go, indulge in the frivolities - they're good for the heart. And mine will be all the lighter, to see you enjoying yourself.",

    "conversation": "[description] CinematicNodeContext: Player hands book to Gale\nGale: That devil Raphael was telling the truth. There's no doubt - the Crown of Karsus is what's controlling the elder brain. And this - this is no mere journal - it contains Karsus' original plans for the Crown's construction. His designs for godhood.\nPlayer: A design you could follow?\nGale: Not from scratch - unless you happen to have several pounds of the purest Netherese metals in that pack of yours? Don't worry - I'm not asking you to surrender anything else on my account. What's called for here is something altogether different. The book states that the Crown and Netherstones were originally one construct, seemingly sundered at the moment of Karsus' downfall. If we can collect the crown's setting, and the three Netherstones, and with the correct invocation of certain spells and gestures detailed in these notes... I think I could reforge it.\nPlayer: That Crown's caused chaos. We should be seeking a way to destroy it, not make it more powerful.\nGale: Do not mistake the crown itself for the actions of its wearer, or rather, those controlling its wearer at present. If we could restore its former glory, it would no longer be a mere leash and collar, used to subjugate friend or foe. It would be something greater. Something divine. Just think of it... the power of the gods in mortal hands at last. We'd be free of doctrine and dogma, confined only by the limits of our imaginations. I promise you - the gods will never grant us such a blessing, no matter how much we worship and adore them.\nPlayer: You dismiss the entire pantheon so easily. Not all gods are selfish.\nGale: Some gods may delude themselves into believing they care about their worshippers, but when it comes down to it - we're all expendable. Children to be appeased, not respected. I worshipped Mystra loyally for years, and in that time she granted me the barest sliver of the power I was ready to wield. Even with the fate of the world at stake, she had little more to offer me than the means of blowing myself up at a more convenient time. She's done nothing to help us. Mystra wanted the brain obliterated because of this crown. She fears a world in which such power is beyond her control - ready to be claimed by Karsus' successor.\nPlayer: Or to destroy the next wizard who attempts it. The attempt would kill you as it killed Karsus.\nGale: Do you think I had not considered that? I have no intention of repeating his folly. Powerful as he was, Karsus lacked some advantages I can lay claim to. I know Mystra - intimately. And I carry a fragment of the Weave itself within my body. Karsus achieved many things, but he never managed that. A long road lies ahead before the Crown comes into our possession. All I ask for now is that you not dismiss this possibility out of hand. Please - at least think on it.\nPlayer: The pursuit of knowledge and power is in our nature. There's no question - you must do this.",

She preferred it when we were alone, curled up before a crackling hearth with some ancient, esoteric tome between us, ink glinting in the firelight...\nPlayer: Who are you referring to? A former lover, perhaps?\nGale: I speak of Tara, my tressym, assistant, my constant companion through all the ills and tribulations my hubris has thrust upon me. She'd be most impressed by our efforts saving these tieflings. Proud, even. And I've given her little to be proud of recently. After I was afflicted with my condition, I locked myself in my tower for an entire year. I was inconsolable, wallowing in my self-inflicted tragedy. I'd given up on myself, but Tara never did. It was her encouragement, her research that led me to my treatment. Once we knew that magically-infused items were the key, she went out to find them for me. She saved my life. After so long being cared for by someone else, it feels good to have repaid the favour. Not directly to Tara, but to these poor tieflings. I'm sure she would approve.\nPlayer: What is Tara like?\nGale: 'Smart' does her a disservice. She's a fine wizard in her own right, though somewhat held back by her lack of opposable thumbs. You remind me of her somewhat. An expression you both share - when she gives in to her more feline qualities, a mouse trapped beneath her paw... I wish she were here for me to make a formal introduction, but I would never ask her to undertake such a journey. She is safer at home. Besides, she was always telling me I needed to spread my wings, so to speak. Find mortal friends, instead of hanging onto Mystra's coattails. So that's what I'm doing. I hope.\nPlayer: She sounds like a fine animal. One I'd be honoured to know.\nGale: She'll love you. So long as you don't rub her belly. She hates it when anyone does that.\nPlayer: She sounds great. But I was hoping I meant more to you than an animal companion...\nGale: I assure you, were you to meet Tara you would see the comparison for the flattery it is. But perhaps that's not a point worth labouring further. Suffice it to say, I think rather a lot of you. And there aren't many on this plane who I'd give such high praise.\nPlayer: Being mentioned in the same breath as your pet isn't the compliment you think it is...\nGale: Then let me say it more plainly - I think you're rather wonderful. And that's not a word I waste on anyone unworthy of it.\nPlayer: Actually, I was thinking we'd be wonderful together...\nGale: Wait. Are you saying... You know what, I think I've clearly had far too much wine. And you've had nowhere near enough. I think this is a conversation best held back on - for now.

Yet you haven't uttered a peep one way or the other about it. The power to change the world - it may be within our reach. You must have an opinion, surely.\nPlayer: I don't know what to say.

They and Gale are now sitting in a small boat that shimmers with iridescent light. Unpiloted, it silently meanders through a majestic, infinite starfield.\nGale: The Outer Planes. This is where gods dwell. Where they observe us from afar. Where they make play-things of us. They would keep all of this from us - the power, the possibilities. They only want us to serve them, pray to them... and ultimately, die for them. But what if we didn't need them? What if we wielded their power instead, and helped ourselves in all the ways they refuse to. I could make that happen. I could make this illusion a reality, with you by my side.\nPlayer: You'd defy Mystra? As if we need more enemies.\nGale: I've already defied Mystra.

The tadpoles, the orb - these threats to our existence - the gods could aid us if they wished, but instead they cower behind Ao. So let us act ourselves.\nNodeContext: Ao = AY-oh (an overlord deity that most gods answer to)\nGale: With the power of the crown, any foe would be rendered impotent.

More's the pity you've already found someone else to make merry with, just the two of you. You might be in for an adventure with Karlach. More than you bargained for - with a bit of luck.

Far be it from me of course, to question your tastes.\nPlayer: Actually, I may just want to spend the night with you instead of Astarion.\nGale: Indeed? Perhaps that's a moment we ought to further explore. Allow me to make the following proposition: There's a book that circulates in Amn, detailing the first thousand nights of a newlywed king and queen. They turned everything they did into an art. The art of conversation. The art of taste, time honoured and newly acquired. The art of the body. The exploration and acceptance of the self and the other. The art of the night itself. I say we take a page from their book.\nPlayer: Leave it to you to woo someone with a book.\nGale: Forget the book then. Let's be blank slates on blank sheets, delightfully new. What do you say?\nPlayer: I'm not sure you're the one I want.\nGale: That's because you've yet to find out what you're missing. Doubt is a spoilsport. Cast it aside.\nPlayer: You're right.

Tara is not any cat. She's a tressym. And given your confusion, I'm guessing you've never met one. They're brilliant creatures - fine company for any self-respecting wizard. I speak of Tara, my tressym, assistant, my constant companion through all the ills and tribulations my hubris has thrust upon me. She'd be proud to see me keeping such fine company - the saviour of those poor tieflings, no less. And I've given her precious little to be proud of recently. She has a good heart, and she would recognise the same in your actions here. I'm sure she'd approve of me lending myself to your efforts. After so long being cared for by someone else, it feels good to have repaid the favour. Not directly to Tara, but to these poor tieflings. I'm sure she would approve.\nPlayer: She must be very smart, to have done all that.\nGale: 'Smart' does her a disservice. She's a fine wizard in her own right, though somewhat held back by her lack of opposable thumbs. You remind me of her somewhat. An expression you both share - when she gives in to her more feline qualities, a mouse trapped beneath her paw... I wish she were here for me to make a formal introduction, but I would never ask her to undertake such a journey. She is safer at home. Besides, she was always telling me I needed to spread my wings, so to speak. Find mortal friends, instead of hanging onto Mystra's coattails. So that's what I'm doing. I hope.\nPlayer: She sounds like a fine animal. One I'd be honoured to know.\nGale: She'll love you. So long as you don't rub her belly. She hates it when anyone does that.\nPlayer: Not as much as I hate talking about cats. Is there nothing else on your mind?\nGale: Not an animal lover? Nobody's perfect, I suppose. Nonetheless, your finer qualities are remarkably plentiful. Suffice it to say, I think rather a lot of you. And there aren't many on this plane who I'd give such high praise.\nPlayer: I'm flattered. Is your good opinion so hard to come by?\nGale: One doesn't become the most powerful archmage in Waterdeep and lover to the goddess of magic herself by having low standards. I assure you, when I tell someone they're wonderful - I mean it. And you are wonderful. I think you're rather wonderful. And that's not a word I waste on anyone unworthy of it.\nPlayer: Actually, I was thinking we'd be wonderful together...\nGale: Wait. Are you saying... You know what, I think I've clearly had far too much wine. And you've had nowhere near enough. I think this is a conversation best held back on - for now. With my condition as volatile as it is, I fear any undue, er, excitement, may tip it over the edge. So to speak. Go, indulge in the frivolities - they're good for the heart. And mine will be all the lighter, to see you enjoying yourself.",

I hope, though we've only known each other for a short time, I might be able to count you among that number?\nPlayer: Friends with the mighty Gale of Waterdeep? I'd be honoured.\nGale: I'm glad.

This is where gods dwell. Where they observe us from afar. Where they make play-things of us. They would keep all of this from us - the power, the possibilities. They only want us to serve them, pray to them... and ultimately, die for them. But what if we didn't need them? What if we wielded their power instead, and helped ourselves in all the ways they refuse to. I could make that happen.

It's merely a tool - a means to an end. You told me once to choose you, the one who loved me. That's what this is all about. Do you doubt me?\nPlayer: If you believe this can be done, then I will believe too.\nGale: You mean... you want the same as I do?\nNodeContext: Hope rising again\nPlayer: Yes.

Tell me, Sazza, did your misadventures take you to the Underdark?\nSazza: They woz in some rickety druid grove! Mostly full of tieflin's, but them intruders you're after were hidin' out there!\nNightwarden Minthara: I presume you dealt with my prey, and massacred the rest?\nSazza: Ah... well, the thing about that is... they sorta massacred us. This mug helped me escape though. I say we stick a few holes in them... show how grateful we are.\n\nNarrator: *You feel a cold hand caress your mind as the drow appraises you.*\nNightwarden Minthara: Oh dear. Your prisoner is one of the Absolute's favourites, Sazza. A True Soul.\nSazza: Nah. Can't be... they woz in the grove, hangin' around with the tieflin's.\nNightwarden Minthara: Undercover, no doubt. Carrying out the Absolute's will. Oh, Sazza - you have made a grave error. And it will be your last. My spiders are hungry, little one... ...but before they feast, tell me where that grove is, and I may yet spare your life.\nSazza: It's past the bridge, to the east! Big ol' gate, covered in ivy! Don't hurt me, mistress. Please!\nNightwarden Minthara: I will not hurt you. My spiders will have that pleasure.\nSazza: No! I mucked up, I'm sorry! But I didn't know who they woz... they didn't tell me nothin'!\nPlayer: She's telling the truth. She didn't know.\nSazza: I told ya! I was tryin' to follow orders best I could!\nNightwarden Minthara: Silence, wretch. And remember - you owe your miserable life to this one.\nSazza: I won't cause any more trouble - I swears it.\nNightwarden Minthara: Through sheer luck, that pathetic worm has brought me the information I need. And it seems that the inhabitants of the grove trust you - we can use that against them. You have a part to play in this slaughter. Return to the grove. When my raiding party approaches, throw open the gate and signal me.\nNarrator: *The fate of the grove's inhabitants hangs in the balance.* *Killing the drow here would spare them, but it might be better to face her warband at the grove itself, on familiar ground.* *On the other hand, participating in the slaughter as she asks may be the perfect way to earn her trust, and access to the cult's inner circle.*\nPlayer: You misunderstand.
