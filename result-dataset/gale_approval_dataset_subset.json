    "conversation": "Jaheira: There is a grave threat to us all, stretching as far as Baldur's Gate, and I need your help.\nJaheira: The cult of the Absolute is spreading through the city - quietly, quickly, and with unsettling deliberation.\nJaheira: We tracked them to this ancient village only to be faced with a man we killed and buried over a century ago.\nPlayer: Ketheric Thorm, I presume.\nJaheira: The one and only. He was a Sharran, then. We caught him building an army of Dark Justiciars. With the local druids, we made a powerful alliance and put him down.\nJaheira: But he's returned. Not only does General Ketheric Thorm live again, it seems he is no longer mortal. He has become, in fact, invincible.\nJaheira: We met him on the road here - commanding an army of the Absolute, intent on destroying Baldur's Gate. I put an arrow through his eye myself, only to watch him pluck it out like a splinter.\nJaheira: He healed right in front of me, and chased us into the shadows. Things looked hopeless, but experience has taught me that no matter how bleak things look, there's always hope.\nJaheira: You are that hope.\nPlayer: What do you have in mind?\nJaheira: Protected by your artefact, you can infiltrate his forces at Moonrise Towers, posing as a True Soul.\nJaheira: Find out what it is that makes him invincible so we can strip him of his advantage.\nJaheira: Once Ketheric is without his shield, the sword: together we assault his tower, and put a final end to this blight.\nPlayer: There's something you should know - Marcus, the Flaming Fist upstairs, is a True Soul. He wants to kidnap Isobel.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Jaheir takes the glass from the table.\nJaheira: This place is crawling with Harpers. If Marcus managed to get himself infected, we would've known the same minute.\nJaheira: Is this some kind of test? Or a game, perhaps?\nPlayer: Absolutely not. Marcus is a danger to you all.\n: False\nJaheira: A Harper's gaze can only be turned by proof. By the looks of it, a tall tale is all you have to offer.\nJaheira: But you're far from the most eccentric drinking companion I've had. I'd like to know more. Cheers.\nJaheira: To your very good health.\nPlayer: And I'll drink to the darkness that will soon fall when I drag Isobel all the way to Moonrise Towers.",

She won't be a problem.\nJaheira: You make promises that aren't yours to keep. Take care that their breaking does not break something more.\nMinsc: If Minsc is certain of one thing, it is that he very much plans on being a problem for Sarevok.\nSarevok Anchev: I know this one well. I have travelled in her company.

I'll get my people clear of this - but on our terms.\nPlayer: Can you delay the ritual?\nZevlor: You saw what they were willing to do to a child just for trying.\nZevlor: It's Kagha's influence. Without her twisting things, I believe the druids might see sense.\nPlayer: You need to cut your losses and run. I'll help.\nZevlor: It's good of you to offer, but there's a whole army of goblins out there.\nZevlor: We'd need an army of our own to escort us safely to Baldur's Gate, and while I don't doubt your abilities... you're no army.\nZevlor: There may be a way though. Goblins are ill-disciplined - it's unlike them to organise so cleverly.\n\nZevlor: Somebody must be leading them, bringing discipline to their ranks. Take out that leadership, and they'll scatter.\nZevlor: It's no small thing to ask, but... I've seen you fight. You're equal to the task.\nWyll: By the Triad, there is only one correct answer. Refuse him, and we sentence these people to die.\nPlayer: Kill the goblin horde's leaders? I'll see what I can do.",

Though I confess it has been very interesting.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: You see, these murders have been cropping up all over the city. I've been following their trail for a while now, and tracing it back to its roots.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: The ritualistic brutality of them... it's extraordinary. And it could only be the work of a Bhaalist.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: But you've been investigating too, if I'm not mistaken? You're trying to stop your own kind?\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: You are here to help me, and not to sacrifice me, aren't you?\nPlayer: I am working against Bhaal - I got a hold of the list of murder targets.",
