The goblins tell me that you forced a confession from our prisoner.\nNightwarden Minthara: Without your help, they would have extracted nothing but screams and blood.\nNarrator: *Her thoughts mingle with yours, a cold hand caressing your brain.*\nNightwarden Minthara: You are a True Soul? Little wonder that you serve me so well.\nNightwarden Minthara: It is time for the raid to begin. The grove, and those who are hiding there, will fall.\nNarrator: *You attune your mind to it. The artefact does not want to part from you. It does not want to fall into the Absolute's clutches.*\nNarrator: *Her mind focuses - the cultists cannot discover that the weapon they seek is within their grasp.*\nNarrator: *The drow's mind closes around yours, her bloodlust like needles in your skull.*\nPlayer: The grove's inhabitants are weak - it's ready to fall.\nNightwarden Minthara: My patience wears thin, True Soul. The hunt must begin.\nNightwarden Minthara: Show me the grove. Be my eyes.\nNarrator: *Images of the battle at the gate shimmer into view, along with the adventurers pleading to be let inside.*\nNarrator: *Tiefling faces flicker into view as she attempts to learn the grove's location.*\nPlayer: Get out of my mind.\nNightwarden Minthara: Destroying this place is the Absolute's will. Would you defy Her?\nPlayer: Open your mind to her.\nNarrator: *She sees the entrance to the grove as the adventurers retreat inside, joining the tieflings...*\nNarrator: *...and then smiles serenely as blood and shadow spread like stains across your memory, erasing all that live there.*\nNightwarden Minthara: The cowards found refuge among the desperate. Perfect.\nNightwarden Minthara: If the inhabitants do not realise you are the knife at their throats, we can use that against them.\nNightwarden Minthara: Go to their refuge and make your way inside. As a friend.\nPlayer: They'll die thinking I'm their hero.\nNightwarden Minthara: Exquisite. The Absolute chose well when She chose you.\nNightwarden Minthara: I will gather a raiding party and move into position.\nNightwarden Minthara: You will open the gates from the inside when the time is right to strike.\nNightwarden Minthara: We will cleanse the place of infidels and burn it to the ground in the Absolute's name.\nNightwarden Minthara: And then we will be the first among Her favourites.\nNarrator: *The masterful painting she depicts of the massacre awakens you hungrily.*\nPlayer: It shall be so.",

Her hands are in a prayer position and she's chanting softly as the moonlight dances around her. She exhales, then inhales and breaths in tendrils of shadow, absorbing them. She swallows, then begins hacking coughing. The moonlight dissipates. She quickly goes from seeming like a divine spirit to a normal young woman.\nIsobel: I didn't realise I had an audience.\nFist Marcus: Isobel. This is -\nIsobel: A Sharran.\nNarrator: *Isobel. The same name as Ketheric Thorm's daughter - the one whose sarcophagus you found empty in the family mausoleum.*\nPlayer: Push your Urges down.\nPlayer: This Sharran exposed a traitor in your midst.\nIsobel: Fair. I admit, Marcus waltzing around the place undetected bodes rather ill for our defences, doesn't it?\nIsobel: Then again, the best defence is a good offence.\nIsobel: Frankly, I'm surprised you're willing to help us. Your kind aren't known for their decency - particularly when a Sharran curse is our greatest obstacle.\nIsobel: But if you are who I think you are, I'd be a fool to reject your help. The True Soul with... well, a soul. Imagine.\nPlayer: I may have the parasite of a True Soul, but not the mind of one.\nIsobel: And that's what makes you essential.\nIsobel: You'll be needing the protection spell, I presume?\nIsobel: Oh - aren't you looking for a protection spell?\nPlayer: I am already protected. My Lady shields me from the curse.\nIsobel: For now, perhaps. But Shar can be fickle, and her love can prove fleeting. Do not turn your back on an advantage you may need... even a Selûnite one.\nIsobel: If nothing else, it can aid any companions who travel with you - somehow I doubt Shar's largesse was extended to them.\nPlayer: Ngh... it hurts...\nIsobel: Well! If the Moonmaiden didn't strike me dead for blessing you, she must rather approve of this little alliance.\nIsobel: This will block the lesser effects of the shadow curse, allowing you to traverse the darkness outside... should Shar's own protection falter, that is.\nIsobel: Curious. Surely the Nightsinger could have shielded all her followers, and made this place her domain long ago... yet she only acts now, and aids you alone. I wonder why.\nPlayer: The Dark Lady's works aren't for me to question.\nIsobel: Mustn't question the great shadow mother, must we?\nIsobel: I'll stop needling you, though. You have more important things to do, after all.\nPlayer: I've already been to Moonrise, but I have more work to do indeed.\nIsobel: I imagine so, if Jaheira hasn't gone tearing off into the night.\nPlayer: You're coming with me, cleric.",

In this intro he feels compelled to speak out of necessity, but he doesn’t really want to.\nGale: That said, necessity compels me to set aside my reservations. I have no choice but to speak.\nGale: You see, I have this... condition. Very different from the parasite we share, but just as deadly.\nPlayer: Can it be cured?\nGale: No, it cannot be cured. And I assure you I've left no page unturned in reaching that conclusion.\nGale: I can keep this condition under control, as indeed I've done for a significant amount of time, but that was under different circumstances altogether. Home, in Waterdeep.\nGale: What it comes down to is this: every so often I need to get my hands on a powerful magical item and absorb the Weave inside.\nPlayer: Wouldn't that ruin the item?\nGale: Trust me when I say - the loss of the occasional wizard's staff or tome of enchantment is a bargain given the cost of allowing me to deteriorate.\nGale: Catastrophe.\nGale: It's been days since I last consumed an artefact - since before we were abducted. It is time.\nGale: And by that I mean it's imperative that I find and consume strands of Weave at the earliest possible juncture.\nGale: That is why I turn to you. I need you to help me find magic items to consume. It is vital. Dare I say it, critical.\nPlayer: I fail to see why you need me to help you with this. You've done fine without me so far.\nGale: A fair point - however, until recently I was able to rely on a supply of artefacts stored in my tower in Waterdeep. A  supply that has now run dry.\nGale: The reality of the matter is that a lone wizard with a chronic impairment such as my own is not in the most ideal of situations with regards to self-defence.\nGale: The manner of artefacts I need are not often found waiting patiently on a shop-keep's shelf. One usually has to lift them delicately from trap-filled tombs or prise them from the hands of violent ne'erdowells.\nGale: There will be danger involved - or great cost.\nPlayer: Why exactly would I risk either of those things for a wizard I barely know?\nGale: Valid question. If not out of the simple goodness of your heart, then perhaps your own self-interest might be sufficient motivation.\nGale: Having a wizard like me around is quite the boon when facing the perils that stalk these lands. It will be far harder for me to assist you if I can barely stand upright.\nGale: Please - trust me. Your help could be the difference between life and death.\nPlayer: My help was already the difference between life and death where you're concerned. You owe me an explanation.\nGale: I'm afraid it doesn't quite work like that - though of course I'm immensely grateful for any assistance you provide in times of mortal peril. But I must ask more trust of you still.\nGale: Please reconsider.\nPlayer: No, I won't. And that's final.\nPlayer: Neither am I. We'll have to see who gives up first.\nGale: Very well. You're clearly in no mood to be receptive to my request at present.",

You are nestled in the cup of her hand.*\nGale: Look at that. We're channelling the Weave. How does it feel?\nGale: You did it. You're channelling the Weave. How does it feel?\nPlayer: Incredible. Though of course, I could have managed it by myself...\nGale: You're hard to please, aren't you?\nNarrator: *The Weave connects you. The moment feels intimate.*\nPlayer: Hold on to the moment.

He's looking at the figure intensely.\nPlayer: Pretty.\nGale: Oh! My, you startled me. I... I was miles away.\nNodeContext: Gale is looking at a miniature magical projection of Mystra he's created in his hand in his hand. Startled, he dispells it.\nPlayer: Is everything all right?\nGale: Of course, of course. I was just... practising an incantation.\nPlayer: If you say so.\nGale: I do - because it's through practice that I seek to perfect. To augment.\nGale: Magic is... my life. I've been in touch with the Weave for as long as I can remember. There's nothing like it.\nGale: It's like music, poetry, physical beauty all rolled into one and given expression through the senses.\nGale: That is why I asked you to seek me out, to offer you a taste of such wonders. Would you like me to show you?\nGale: Would you like to experience this?\nPlayer: Yes, I would.\nGale: Then follow my lead.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: ~Gale walks around behind the player (as though teaching them to fly a kite) and makes a delicate gesture with both hands.\nGale: Now you.\nPlayer: Imitate the gesture with ease.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: ~The player imitates the gesture. There’s a first visual effect. Some sparks of magic start to appear around the player and Gale.\nNarrator: *A familiar feeling - like a kind word and a kind touch at the same time. It's warm and comfortable.*\nGale: Excellent. Now repeat after me: Ah-Thran Mystra-Ryl Kantrach-Ao.\nPlayer: Repeat the words, slowly, but carefully.\nPlayer: You sense power in these words. Speak them deliberately.\n: True\nNarrator: *Suddenly: the scent of rosewater and a sense of wellbeing. A sliver of Weave that tastes sweet on the tongue.*\nGale: Very good. Now I want you to picture in your mind the concept of harmony. As true as you can.\nPlayer: Harmony comes easily to you. Allow it to wash over your mind and magic.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: ~The player and Gale are now fully enveloped in a magic glow - a protective field of beautiful magic. Unconsciously player steps back closer to Gale.\nNarrator: *You see - or is it sense? - the unmistakable presence of Mystra, the Lady of Mysteries.*\nNarrator: *There's something like the anticipation of a kiss, then the pleasure of being cloaked in peace.*\nNarrator: *You are safe. You are nestled in the cup of her hand.*\nGale: You did it. You're channelling the Weave. How does it feel?\nPlayer: It's not quite like praying to her. She feels closer, somehow.\nGale: Quite so. The Weave is a sensitive conduit.\nNarrator: *The Weave connects you. The moment feels intimate.*\nPlayer: Hold on to the moment. It's a good night for intimacy.\nNarrator: *You realise the Weave is making you one. You have but to imagine your desire, and Gale will know it.*\nPlayer: Picture kicking him in the gut.",

He's looking at the figure intensely.\nPlayer: Pretty.\nGale: Oh! My, you startled me. I... I was miles away.\nNodeContext: Gale is looking at a miniature magical projection of Mystra he's created in his hand in his hand. Startled, he dispells it.\nPlayer: Is everything all right?\nGale: Of course, of course. I was just... practising an incantation.\nPlayer: If you say so.\nGale: I do - because it's through practice that I seek to perfect. To augment.\nGale: Magic is... my life. I've been in touch with the Weave for as long as I can remember. There's nothing like it.\nGale: It's like music, poetry, physical beauty all rolled into one and given expression through the senses.\nGale: That is why I asked you to seek me out, to offer you a taste of such wonders. Would you like me to show you?\nGale: Would you like to experience this?\nPlayer: I'd be glad to try, though I normally commune with Mystra through prayer.\nGale: Then follow my lead.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: ~Gale walks around behind the player (as though teaching them to fly a kite) and makes a delicate gesture with both hands.\nGale: Now you.\nPlayer: Imitate the gesture with a flourish.\n: True\nNarrator: *You feel something strange - like a kind word and a kind touch at the same time. It's warm and comfortable.*\nGale: Excellent. Now repeat after me: Ah-Thran Mystra-Ryl Kantrach-Ao.\nPlayer: Repeat the words, bold and proud.\nPlayer: You sense power in these words. Speak them deliberately.\n: True\nNarrator: *Suddenly: the scent of rosewater and a sense of wellbeing. A sliver of Weave that tastes sweet on the tongue.*\nGale: Very good. Now I want you to picture in your mind the concept of harmony. As true as you can.\nPlayer: Sink deep into your magic. It is who you are. It is home.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: ~The player and Gale are now fully enveloped in a magic glow - a protective field of beautiful magic. Unconsciously player steps back closer to Gale.\nNarrator: *You see - or is it sense? - the unmistakable presence of Mystra, the Lady of Mysteries.*\nNarrator: *There's something like the anticipation of a kiss, then the pleasure of being cloaked in peace.*\nNarrator: *You are safe. You are nestled in the cup of her hand.*\nGale: Look at that. We're channelling the Weave. How does it feel?\nGale: You did it. You're channelling the Weave. How does it feel?\nPlayer: It's not quite like praying to her. She feels closer, somehow.\nGale: Quite so. The Weave is a sensitive conduit.\nNarrator: *The Weave connects you. The moment feels intimate.*\nPlayer: Hold on to the moment. It's a good night for intimacy.\nNarrator: *You realise the Weave is making you one. You have but to imagine your desire, and Gale will know it.*\nPlayer: Picture kicking him in the gut.",

Home, in Waterdeep.\nGale: What it comes down to is this: every so often I need to get my hands on a powerful magical item and absorb the Weave inside.\nPlayer: Are you telling me you're addicted to magic?\nGale: No - no, it's nothing like that. Magic isn't a narcotic to me, it's quite literally a life-saver.\nGale: I would not burden anyone other than myself with this were the stakes not so high, and the means of obtaining such artefacts challenging for a humble wizard to face alone.\nGale: Catastrophe.\nGale: It's been days since I last consumed an artefact - since before we were abducted. It's only a matter of time before my craving returns.\nGale: That is why I turn to you. I need you to help me find magic items to consume. It is vital. Dare I say it, critical.\nPlayer: I fail to see why you need me to help you with this. You've done fine without me so far.\nGale: A fair point - however, until recently I was able to rely on a supply of artefacts stored in my tower in Waterdeep. A  supply that has now run dry.\nGale: The reality of the matter is that a lone wizard with a chronic impairment such as my own is not in the most ideal of situations with regards to self-defence.\nGale: The manner of artefacts I need are not often found waiting patiently on a shop-keep's shelf. One usually has to lift them delicately from trap-filled tombs or prise them from the hands of violent ne'erdowells.\nGale: There will be danger involved - or great cost.\nPlayer: Why exactly would I risk either of those things for a wizard I barely know?\nGale: Valid question. If not out of the simple goodness of your heart, then perhaps your own self-interest might be sufficient motivation.\nGale: Having a wizard like me around is quite the boon when facing the perils that stalk these lands. It will be far harder for me to assist you if I can barely stand upright.\nGale: Please - trust me. Your help could be the difference between life and death.\nPlayer: No. If you aren't willing to tell me the truth, I'm not helping you.\nGale: I understand that I'm asking for a lot, but I can't tell you everything. Not yet anyway.\nGale: Please reconsider.\nPlayer: You aren't going to drop this, are you?\nGale: No.\nPlayer: Neither am I. We'll have to see who gives up first.\nGale: Very well. You're clearly in no mood to be receptive to my request at present.",

Her hands are in a prayer position and she's chanting softly as the moonlight dances around her. She exhales, then inhales and breaths in tendrils of shadow, absorbing them. She swallows, then begins hacking coughing. The moonlight dissipates. She quickly goes from seeming like a divine spirit to a normal young woman.\nIsobel: I didn't realise I had an audience.\nFist Marcus: Isobel. This is -\nIsobel: A Sharran.\nNarrator: *Isobel. The same name as Ketheric Thorm's daughter - the one whose sarcophagus you found empty in the family mausoleum.*\nPlayer: Push your Urges down.\nPlayer: Let's not let an ancient squabble interfere with the task at hand.\nIsobel: Not as ancient as you think.\nIsobel: Frankly, I'm surprised you're willing to help us.

Better to humour her than make an enemy of all in this place. Lady Shar will understand.\nIsobel: Refreshingly pragmatic of you. I sense Shar has offered some amount of protection to you already, but... well, no harm in extra precaution - even from a Selûnite.\nPlayer: Try to understand what's happening.\nNarrator: *Is Lady Shar punishing you? Or perhaps testing you? Is it the tadpole, or a curse? You cannot say.*\nIsobel: Well! If the Moonmaiden didn't strike me dead for blessing you, she must rather approve of this little alliance.\nIsobel: This will block the lesser effects of the shadow curse, allowing you to traverse the darkness outside... should Shar's own protection falter, that is.\nIsobel: Curious. Surely the Nightsinger could have shielded all her followers, and made this place her domain long ago... yet she only acts now, and aids you alone. I wonder why.\nPlayer: The Dark Lady's works aren't for me to question.\nIsobel: Mustn't question the great shadow mother, must we?\nIsobel: I'll stop needling you, though.

Her hands are in a prayer position and she's chanting softly as the moonlight dances around her. She exhales, then inhales and breaths in tendrils of shadow, absorbing them. She swallows, then begins hacking coughing. The moonlight dissipates. She quickly goes from seeming like a divine spirit to a normal young woman.\nIsobel: I didn't realise I had an audience.\nFist Marcus: Isobel. This is -\nIsobel: A Sharran.\nNarrator: *Isobel. The same name as Ketheric Thorm's daughter - the one whose sarcophagus you found empty in the family mausoleum.*\nPlayer: Push your Urges down.\nPlayer: I thought I smelled a Selûnite.\nIsobel: At your service.\nIsobel: Frankly, I'm surprised you're willing to help us. Your kind aren't known for their decency - particularly when a Sharran curse is our greatest obstacle.\nIsobel: But if you are who I think you are, I'd be a fool to reject your help. The True Soul with... well, a soul. Imagine.\nPlayer: You seem to have a lot to say about my allegiance. Can we focus on the task at hand?\nIsobel: I suppose that would be wise. We have a common enemy, after all: Ketheric Thorm.\nIsobel: You'll be needing the protection spell, I presume?\nIsobel: Oh - aren't you looking for a protection spell?\nPlayer: Nod. Better to humour her than make an enemy of all in this place. Lady Shar will understand.\nIsobel: Refreshingly pragmatic of you. I sense Shar has offered some amount of protection to you already, but... well, no harm in extra precaution - even from a Selûnite.\nPlayer: Silently petition Lady Shar for guidance.\nNarrator: *She offers you nothing.*\nIsobel: Well! If the Moonmaiden didn't strike me dead for blessing you, she must rather approve of this little alliance.\nIsobel: This will block the lesser effects of the shadow curse, allowing you to traverse the darkness outside... should Shar's own protection falter, that is.\nIsobel: Curious. Surely the Nightsinger could have shielded all her followers, and made this place her domain long ago... yet she only acts now, and aids you alone. I wonder why.\nPlayer: I don't know what to make of it myself.\nIsobel: I suppose Shar is nothing if not mysterious.\nIsobel: I'll stop needling you, though. You have more important things to do, after all.\nPlayer: I've already been to Moonrise, but I have more work to do indeed.\nIsobel: I imagine so, if Jaheira hasn't gone tearing off into the night.\nPlayer: You're coming with me, cleric.",

If the Moonmaiden didn't strike me dead for blessing you, she must rather approve of this little alliance.\nIsobel: This will block the lesser effects of the shadow curse, allowing you to traverse the darkness outside... should Shar's own protection falter, that is.\nIsobel: Curious. Surely the Nightsinger could have shielded all her followers, and made this place her domain long ago... yet she only acts now, and aids you alone.

Startled, he dispells it.\nPlayer: Is everything all right?\nGale: Of course, of course. I was just... practising an incantation.\nPlayer: There's more to it than that.

She's Mystra.\nGale: I can't quite describe it, the need I sometimes feel to see her - to draw the filaments of fantasy into existence.\nGale: No sculpture or painting could ever do her justice, only the fabric that she herself is and embodies:\nGale: The Weave.\nGale: Mystra is all magic.

Now repeat after me: Ah-Thran Mystra-Ryl Kantrach-Ao.\nPlayer: Belt the words with a little flourish on 'Ao'.\n: True\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: The visual effect intensifies. There’s the start of a glow, of a rush of beautiful magic.\nNarrator: *Ah, yes: the scent of rosewater and a sense of wellbeing. A sliver of Weave that tastes sweet on the tongue.*\nGale: Very good. Now I want you to picture in your mind the concept of harmony. As true as you can.\nPlayer: Sink deep into your magic. It is who you are. It is home.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: ~The player and Gale are now fully enveloped in a magic glow - a protective field of beautiful magic. Unconsciously player steps back closer to Gale.\nNarrator: *You see - or is it sense? - the unmistakable presence of Mystra, the Lady of Mysteries.*\nNarrator: *There's something like the anticipation of a kiss, then the pleasure of being cloaked in peace.*\nNarrator: *You are safe. You are nestled in the cup of her hand.*\nGale: You did it. You're channelling the Weave. How does it feel?\nPlayer: The same as it always does.\nGale: You're hard to please, aren't you?\nNarrator: *The Weave connects you. The moment feels intimate.*\nPlayer: Hold on to the moment. It's a good night for intimacy.\nNarrator: *You realise the Weave is making you one. You have but to imagine your desire, and Gale will know it.*\nPlayer: Picture his severed head on a spike.",

If you are here, it is because it suits her.\nGandrel: Her kind have hidden among us since the first darkness - and their knowledge is matched only by their spite.\nGandrel: Know how to ask, and they'll share that knowledge. If you're fool enough to pay their price.\nPlayer: What price is that?\nGandrel: Whatever's easiest to lose and hardest to do without.\nGandrel: But the thing I hunt has gone to ground. If she can tell me how to draw him out, I'll pay whatever she asks.\nGandrel: But she thrives on suffering. Once she hears what awaits my quarry when I catch him, she will help.\nPlayer: Who is it you're hunting?\nGandrel: Truth is like a blade, my friend. We can arm ourselves with it.\nGandrel: Or just as easily find it pressed against our throat. I would not put you in danger.\nPlayer: Come now - I've almost certainly killed worse.\n: True\nGandrel: I would not be so sure. But I won't keep the truth from you.\nGandrel: I hunt a vampire spawn called Astarion.

Astarion's been dealt with.\nGandrel: You know him? Not too well, I think, if you believe he is so easily slain. He could be stalking your camp at this very moment.\nGandrel: Perhaps you could tell me where to look, and I could ensure peace of mind for us both?\nGandrel: But you're right - he's no true vampire. Not yet. I don't suppose you'll tell me where he is?\nPlayer: Tell him how to find your camp.",

I'd do anything to take it back. Anything.\nPlayer: Stab yourself. Rip your stomach open. Feel the pain of your friends - only then will you be free.\nPlayer: Anything? Then hurt yourself as Ben and Marc did - stab yourself.\n: True\nMadeline: Like... this?\nNodeContext: Madeline draws a blade from behind her and holds it in front of her stomach, blade pointed towards her stomach. She is utterly terrified (pose like seppuku)\nPlayer: Prove you're sorry. Do it for Ben and Marc.\nMadeline: Ah! I'm sorry.\nNodeContext: Ah! is a noise of pain as she stabs herself in the stomach and then pulls out the knife. 'I'm sorry' is said in clear pain.\nMadeline: Argh. I'm so sorry.\nNodeContext: stabs herself again on 'Argh', noise of pain. I'm so so sorry is half crying as she's in agony.\nPlayer: Keep going.",

Nere - I aided him in the Underdark.\nBalthazar: Ah, it was you who pulled his sorry carcass from the rubble. You should have left him there.\nBalthazar: The miserable worm tried to kill me, hoping to take all the glory of this mission for himself.\nBalthazar: Dull, dull, dull. Nere was never cut out to be a True Soul - he's a very obedient corpse, though.\nBalthazar: Perhaps you can prove to me that you're more useful alive than dead.

How do you keep going?\nPlayer: I'll let you know when I figure it out.\nAlfira: We're in the same boat, then? That's... somewhat of a comfort.\nAlfira: You've done so much for us already, but I have to ask - the others might still be out there.\nAlfira: If they're not dead, they're in Moonrise.

Not an entirely unpromising specimen, for one naturally-born.\nNodeContext: Begrudging and largely hostile, but with a hint of appreciation for the player's skill in actually making it this far.\nBalthazar: Not just any True Soul would have succeeded in following my path through this place. You should be pleased.\nBalthazar: I take it the breaking of my skeletons was an accident - the living are so clumsy, after all.\nPlayer: I'm pleased to be of service, Balthazar.\nBalthazar: Perhaps you can prove to me that you're more useful alive than dead. You know what's at stake here, I take it?\nBalthazar: But you're here now, and I may be able to put those limbs to work. You know what's at stake here, I take it?\nPlayer: Judging by how you're cowering in here, your survival?\nBalthazar: I do not cower - I plan. I command. I create.\nBalthazar: General Thorm trusts me. He knows I will deliver. He knows I will stand by him long after all others wilt and fall.\nBalthazar: You, Z'rell, all the rest... you have only one body with which to serve. I have as many as I care to make.\nPlayer: As you mention serving Ketheric, he sent you to find a relic, no?\nBalthazar: General Thorm to you. But yes, recovering the relic is the crux of it. He commands, and I, his humble servant, fulfil that command.\nBalthazar: While you, an infinitely more humble servant, fulfil my command. I will put you to work - as a scout.\nNarrator: *This necromancer has Ketheric's trust. Helping him could be just what you need to gain access to the man himself.*\nPlayer: What are the properties of this relic, magical or otherwise? So I can be of better assistance, of course.\nPlayer: I need more to go on. Why is this relic so important? What does it do?\n: False\nBalthazar: Telling you will not make the task any less perilous. Just obey, and use your ignorance as a shield. You should be adept at that already.\nBalthazar: The Nightsong lends the General his strength, his invulnerability. It must be recovered, before his enemies attempt to exploit it.\nPlayer: You need my help?\nBalthazar: I do not need you, or your help. But you are here in spite of that, so I may as well make use of you.\nBalthazar: The Nightsong is close, but the way is barred and Shar's dead are... uncooperative. Clear the path for me - by blade, cunning, or whatever it takes.\nBalthazar: I will remain here until you have succeeded, or fallen.\nShadowheart: I'd trust this gasbag about as far as I can throw him - which isn't far. But perhaps better to play along, for now.\nPlayer: For jobs like this it's good form to provide your operatives some extra resources.\n: True\nBalthazar: Fine. I will assign Flesh to aid you on your way. Ring this bell...\nBalthazar: ...Hmm. Misplaced, it seems. You will be capable enough without it.\nPlayer: I'll see what I can do.",

Let's do it.\nAraj Oblodra: Just a little prick and it's all over. Close your eyes.\nAraj Oblodra: A little pain for a lot of gold. And...\nAraj Oblodra: There we are. All of your very best traits in a bottle. Use it well!\nAraj Oblodra: Although perhaps there's one more thing we could discuss: your friend.\nAraj Oblodra: He's a vampire, no? Or one of their spawn, at least.\nAstarion: Don't worry, we're all friends under the Absolute. I won't bite.\nAraj Oblodra: Oh I'd prefer if you did.\nAraj Oblodra: I assume he belongs to you?\nPlayer: Yes. All mine.\nAraj Oblodra: Well, I hope you don't mind sharing him for just a minute.\nAraj Oblodra: Do you have a name, spawn?\nAstarion: Astarion, but hold on-\nAraj Oblodra: Good. Now, Astarion, I've dreamt of being bitten by a vampire since I was a young girl.\nAstarion: I'm sorry? You want to be bitten?\nAraj Oblodra: To feel your life's blood slipping away? To dance on the edge between life and death? Yes, I want it.\nAraj Oblodra: I'll even compensate you - a potion of legendary power that forever increases the strength of the one who consumes it.\nAraj Oblodra: It's not for sale, but it's yours if you bite me.\nAstarion: I will have to decline.\nAraj Oblodra: Excuse me? This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and you're squandering it.\nAstarion: I gave you my answer.\nAraj Oblodra: Can't you talk some sense into your obstinate charge?\nPlayer: I am surprised, Astarion. I thought you'd jump at a chance like this.\nAstarion: I'm sorry, but could you excuse us a moment?\nAstarion: Are you actually asking me to do this? Trading me for some potion?\nAstarion: Because there's something wrong with her blood. I can smell it from here - it's rank.\nPlayer: Her house, Oblodra, was infamous for experimenting with mind flayers. Could her blood be tainted somehow?\nAstarion: That would explain the stench, yes.\nAstarion: I already have enough illithid filth in my head - I don't want it in my stomach as well.\nAraj Oblodra: I don't have all day, True Soul.\nPlayer: Don't do anything you don't want to.\nAstarion: All right.

Nere was never cut out to be a True Soul - he's a very obedient corpse, though.\nBalthazar: Perhaps you can prove to me that you're more useful alive than dead.

Don't make threats you can't back up.\n: True\nBalthazar: ...Fine. I'll forgive your transgressions this time - there are much grander things at stake.\nNodeContext: A pause before 'fine' - weighing up the player's fate.\nBalthazar: The Nightsong is my finest creation - if I never exceed myself, I will still die happy. Not that I ever intend to do something as gauche as truly dying, of course.\nBalthazar: Now, given your prying nature, I have work for you, as a scout.\nBalthazar: The Nightsong lends the General his strength, his invulnerability. It must be recovered, before his enemies attempt to exploit it.\nPlayer: You need my help?\nBalthazar: I do not need you, or your help. But you are here in spite of that, so I may as well make use of you.\nBalthazar: The Nightsong is close, but the way is barred and Shar's dead are... uncooperative.

There are much grander things at stake.\nNodeContext: A pause before 'fine' - weighing up the player's fate.\nBalthazar: The Nightsong is my finest creation - if I never exceed myself, I will still die happy. Not that I ever intend to do something as gauche as truly dying, of course.\nBalthazar: Now, given your prying nature, I have work for you, as a scout.\nBalthazar: The Nightsong lends the General his strength, his invulnerability. It must be recovered, before his enemies attempt to exploit it.\nPlayer: Sounds like you've good reason to be proud of the Nightsong - tell me more.\nBalthazar: And spoil the surprise? I think not.

When you see for yourself, you will understand.\nPlayer: What do you need me to do?\nBalthazar: I do not need you, or your help. But you are here in spite of that, so I may as well make use of you.\nBalthazar: The Nightsong is close, but the way is barred and Shar's dead are... uncooperative. Clear the path for me - by blade, cunning, or whatever it takes.\nBalthazar: I will remain here until you have succeeded, or fallen.\nShadowheart: I'd trust this gasbag about as far as I can throw him - which isn't far.

She ain't the type you say no to.\nMadeline: She gave 'em a dagger each, and told 'em to press it against their stomachs.\nMadeline: On the count of three, to 'start stabbin', and not to stop 'til she said so.\nMadeline: She never said stop. I'd do anything to take it back. Anything.\nPlayer: Anything? Then hurt yourself as Ben and Marc did - stab yourself.\n: True\nMadeline: Like... this?\nNodeContext: Madeline draws a blade from behind her and holds it in front of her stomach, blade pointed towards her stomach. She is utterly terrified (pose like seppuku)\nPlayer: Start stabbing, and don't stop until I say so.\nMadeline: Ah! I'm sorry.\nNodeContext: Ah! is a noise of pain as she stabs herself in the stomach and then pulls out the knife. 'I'm sorry' is said in clear pain.\nMadeline: Argh. I'm so sorry.\nNodeContext: stabs herself again on 'Argh', noise of pain. I'm so so sorry is half crying as she's in agony.\nPlayer: Stop. You've done enough.",

Would you be interested in studying it?\nHavkelaag: A githyanki egg? What a fortuitous turn of events. I've been attempting to get my hands on one for some time now.\nHavkelaag: Would you consider parting with it? The Society's coffers are deep enough to cover any expenses accrued in its retrieval, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: Chk. Don't you dare consider it.\nPlayer: What are you going to do with it?\nHavkelaag: Study it, of course. The githyanki have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months.\nHavkelaag: You yourself have no doubt experienced the prejudice of those who assume that, as beings of the Underdark, we are inherently evil.\nHavkelaag: The githyanki face similar prejudice, but I believe, if hatched in a less violent, more intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome its evil predispositions.\nHavkelaag: I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: You're letting your personal biases affect your method. Why assume they're evil?\nHavkelaag: I assume nothing. Innate githyanki cruelty is an established fact - no doubt you witnessed it yourself in the retrieval of the egg itself.\nHavkelaag: When I have a suitable sample for my study, I will, however, prove that the effects of their biological inclination are reversible.\nHavkelaag: Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach:\nHavkelaag: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue.\nHavkelaag: Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: You would teach the child virtue, but rear it without patience. Curious.\nHavkelaag: Tell me, then, philosopher - if patience delays the fostering of the other virtues, can it be rightly called virtuous?\nPlayer: Patience does not delay, it simply tempers virtue. Curtails it from excess.\nHavkelaag: A cautious, hesitant instinct. One I am afraid we do not have time for.\nHavkelaag: My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: And what if your experiment fails?\nHavkelaag: If the child remains evil after the experiment is concluded, it will be destroyed. Such is the fate of all used specimens.\nHavkelaag: Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg? ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: A gith hatchling is not a lab rat! This shka'keth should be bled dry for the mere suggestion.\nPlayer: Sell the egg.\nHavkelaag: Ah. Unfortunately, it seems I've mislaid my purse.\nHavkelaag: I don't suppose you'd consider simply donating it to the Society instead?\nPlayer: Fine. Here you go.",

Unless...\nHalsin: ...Hrrm. That look in your eyes - I've seen it before. Are you feeling all right?\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Halsin raises a hand to your head, magically connecting with you (no contact). He gives an alarmed look - he knows what’s inside you\nHalsin: Oak Father preserve you, child... You're infected, aren't you? The mind flayers' spawn.\nHalsin: But... something's different. You're aware of the monster inside you. You don't bow to the Absolute, like the True Souls do...\nHalsin: How is this possible...?\nPlayer: I think this artefact has something to do with it.\nHalsin: Hmmm... that looks very alien. As alien as the mind flayers. They do not belong on this world.\nHalsin: You weren't speaking lightly when you said you needed help. Let me tell you what I know.\nHalsin: I've been studying these parasites for a while now. Ever since I discovered these so-called True Souls are infected with them.\nHalsin: Someone is using very powerful magic to modify these tadpoles. They are using them to exert control over the infected.\nHalsin: I'm sorry to say, I can't undo that magic, which means I can't cure you. But that doesn't mean I can't help.\nHalsin: I didn't find what I came here for - a way to remove the tadpoles - but I found the next best thing. I found out where they come from.\nHalsin: That must be where these enchantments are placed on them, and it's where you'll find your cure.\nPlayer: How did you come to study mind flayer parasites?\nHalsin: A drow forced me to defend myself. Afterwards, I was able to study the parasite that slithered out of the corpse, see what drives these 'True Souls'.\nHalsin: I had no idea anyone beyond their ranks was infected. You have my sincere sympathies.\nPlayer: This magic you mentioned - it isn't normal for these parasites?\nPlayer: Then everything we did here was hopeless.\nHalsin: Patience. I can't just snap my fingers... but I know where the solution almost certainly lies.\nHalsin: I overheard that the cultists are sending all of their captives to Moonrise Towers.\nHalsin: Innocents go in, True Souls come out. Given that all of these True Souls are infected, it has to be the source of this magic.\nHalsin: If you want to find a cure, you must head there and discover how the tadpoles are being manipulated.\nPlayer: You seem to know a lot about this. Will you come with me to Moonrise?\nHalsin: I wish I could, but there's still work I've yet to finish - blood I've yet to spill.\nHalsin: I've no right to ask more of you... but if you could help me, I'd be free to join your journey to Moonrise.\nHalsin: I cannot allow these butchers to threaten my grove. The natural order must be protected.\nPlayer: Look around you - there's no order anymore. Only chaos.\nHalsin: Chaos is welcome, in doses; it helps keep balance. But this is too much - this is unnatural.\nHalsin: Help me kill the leaders of this horde, save my grove. Then I will help you.\n\nHalsin: Three deaths could win us peace: the drow Minthara, the hobgoblin Dror Ragzlin, and that perversion of a priestess, Gut.\nHalsin: They are the ones holding these parasites together. Remove them and nature will cure itself.\nPlayer: I'll deal with this. You get to safety.\nHalsin: I told you, nowhere is safe. Not while this rot festers. Once it is cut out - once the grove is secure - then I shall leave.\nPlayer: Follow me, then. Your bear form may prove useful.\nHalsin: Be warned - my presence could make things more difficult... I can only restrain my bear form so much. I won't be able to help but attack goblins.\nHalsin: If I join you, we'll likely have to slaughter this entire place. You may want to use discretion when approaching the goblin leaders.\nPlayer: Come with me.\nHalsin: So be it. May Silvanus lend us nature's fury.",

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon’s voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar.\nMalus Thorm: See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy.\nMalus Thorm: Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision.

We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace.\nMalus Thorm: Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver.\nMalus Thorm: Come. Step forward. You are no sister, but that matters none.

What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being?\nMalus Thorm: If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: But you: look how the succour of Shar eludes even you, one who walks faithfully in her shadow. See how painfully present you remain...\nMalus Thorm: We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: The sisters aren't ready.

They should spar each other.\nPlayer: Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\n: True\nMalus Thorm: Yes... For are we not all in need of a cure?\nMalus Thorm: The scalpel does not discriminate. Let each and every one of you partake in its soothing journey.\nMalus Thorm: Absence, sisters. Acquaint yourselves.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) Screaming and slashing, the sisters brutally murder each other.\nMalus Thorm: It is a proud moment when one sees one's teachings so lovingly taken to heart.\nMalus Thorm: You are to be commended for their graduation - rewarded with the promised cure.\nMalus Thorm: Come, I will acquaint you with the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nPlayer: You do me an honour, but I am not worthy.

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon’s voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar.\nMalus Thorm: See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy.\nMalus Thorm: Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace.\nMalus Thorm: Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver.\nMalus Thorm: Come. Step forward. You are no sister, but that matters none. Every student is welcome.\nPlayer: I am a scholar, this is true - just not in the study of torture.\nMalus Thorm: Behold, sisters, the very face of ignorance - one who mistakes tenderness for torture.\nMalus Thorm: Go on. Acquaint the face of ignorance with the true object of our studies.\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly.\nMalus Thorm: It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nShadowheart: A stinging truth - but a truth nonetheless.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being?\nMalus Thorm: If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: But you: look how the succour of Shar eludes you. See how painfully present you remain...\nMalus Thorm: We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: The goddess has greater plans for me than to submit to your scalpels.\n: True\nMalus Thorm: Another absence is your fate? But if you are not here to be cured, how will my sisters learn?\nMalus Thorm: Their incisions are, as yet, still streaked with imprecision - that much I must concede.\nMalus Thorm: How to steady their hands, I wonder.\nPlayer: Practice - that's how I got good with a blade. They should spar each other.\nPlayer: Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\n: True\nMalus Thorm: Yes...

    "conversation": "Gale: Even in such fraught times as these, there is peace to be found in the stillness as evening draws in.\nGale: I used to while away many hours just like these with my companion, though in far comfier surrounds.\nGale: She preferred it when we were alone, curled up before a crackling hearth with some ancient, esoteric tome between us, ink glinting in the firelight...\nPlayer: Are you... are you talking about your cat?\nGale: By Ahghairon's lost nose - no!\nGale: Tara is not any cat. She's a tressym. And given your confusion, I'm guessing you've never met one. They're brilliant creatures - fine company for any self-respecting wizard.\nGale: I speak of Tara, my tressym, assistant, my constant companion through all the ills and tribulations my hubris has thrust upon me.\nGale: She'd be most impressed by our efforts saving these tieflings. Proud, even. And I've given her little to be proud of recently.\nGale: After I was afflicted with my condition, I locked myself in my tower for an entire year. I was inconsolable, wallowing in my self-inflicted tragedy.\nGale: I'd given up on myself, but Tara never did. It was her encouragement, her research that led me to my treatment. Once we knew that magically-infused items were the key, she went out to find them for me. She saved my life.\nGale: After so long being cared for by someone else, it feels good to have repaid the favour. Not directly to Tara, but to these poor tieflings. I'm sure she would approve.\nPlayer: What is Tara like?\nGale: 'Smart' does her a disservice. She's a fine wizard in her own right, though somewhat held back by her lack of opposable thumbs.\nGale: You remind me of her somewhat. Something in the way you roll your eyes when I speak...\nGale: I wish she were here for me to make a formal introduction, but I would never ask her to undertake such a journey. She is safer at home.\nGale: Besides, she was always telling me I needed to spread my wings, so to speak. Find mortal friends, instead of hanging onto Mystra's coattails. So that's what I'm doing. I hope.\nPlayer: She sounds like a fine animal. One I'd be honoured to know.\nGale: She'll love you. So long as you don't rub her belly. She hates it when anyone does that.\nPlayer: Not as much as I hate talking about cats. Is there nothing else on your mind?\nGale: Not an animal lover? Nobody's perfect, I suppose.\nGale: Nonetheless, your finer qualities are remarkably plentiful.\nGale: Suffice it to say, I think rather a lot of you. And there aren't many on this plane who I'd give such high praise.\nPlayer: Being mentioned in the same breath as your pet isn't the compliment you think it is...\nGale: Then let me say it more plainly -\nGale: I think you're rather wonderful. And that's not a word I waste on anyone unworthy of it.\nPlayer: The feeling's mutual - you're a wonderful friend. Though usually more... erudite.",

Shar's succour must only be granted to the willing.\nMalus Thorm: Hmmm. 'Only the willing may know the Lady's embrace.' You know her teachings well.\nMalus Thorm: And yet, these sisters must exercise their gifts, for the art of absence lies in its execution.\nMalus Thorm: How to proceed, I wonder.\nPlayer: 'Only with sacrifice is mastery gained.' For the sisters to learn, you must submit.\n: True\nMalus Thorm: Yes. Submit I must, into the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nMalus Thorm: I see now. By example I must edify and quell the light that blinds us.",

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon’s voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar.\nMalus Thorm: See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy.\nMalus Thorm: Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace.\nMalus Thorm: Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver.\nMalus Thorm: Come. Step forward. I can see the love of Shar darken your eyes. Be welcome.\nPlayer: What lesson are you teaching these sisters?\nMalus Thorm: The crux of our worship.\nMalus Thorm: Tell me, what is the guiding principle of the goddess?\nPlayer: Darkness.\nMalus Thorm: I profess there is another more profound.\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly.\nMalus Thorm: It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nKarlach: What the fuck is this loon talking about.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being?\nMalus Thorm: If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: But you: look how the succour of Shar eludes you. See how painfully present you remain...\nMalus Thorm: We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: Your subject is tainted. Shar's succour must only be granted to the willing.\nMalus Thorm: Hmmm. 'Only the willing may know the Lady's embrace.' You know her teachings well.\nMalus Thorm: And yet, these sisters must exercise their gifts, for the art of absence lies in its execution.\nMalus Thorm: How to proceed, I wonder.\nPlayer: Sparring is vital to progress. Have them practice on each other.\nPlayer: Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\n: True\nMalus Thorm: Yes... For are we not all in need of a cure?\nMalus Thorm: The scalpel does not discriminate. Let each and every one of you partake in its soothing journey.\nMalus Thorm: Absence, sisters. Acquaint yourselves.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) Screaming and slashing, the sisters brutally murder each other.\nMalus Thorm: It is a proud moment when one sees one's teachings so lovingly taken to heart.\nMalus Thorm: You are to be commended for their graduation - rewarded with the promised cure.\nMalus Thorm: Come, I will acquaint you with the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nPlayer: I am not worthy!

Patience is important, but cannot impede the other virtues.\nHavkelaag: Then we are in accord - the time for action is now.\nHavkelaag: My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: Your findings are irrelevant, as are the opinions of all on this kaincha plane.\nHavkelaag: Ah. A display of the well-known githyanki arrogance. I am not sure my experiment can cure that particular affliction, but give me time and I will find a way.\nHavkelaag: Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg?

To bargain?\nPlayer: Are you talking about Auntie Ethel?\nGandrel: A gentle name.

If you're fool enough to pay their price.\nPlayer: And are you fool enough?\nGandrel: Of course. I'm a hunter who lost his prey, and here I am seeking help from something worse.\nGandrel: But she thrives on suffering. Once she hears what awaits my quarry when I catch him, she will help.\nPlayer: I'd advise against helping such a creature thrive. What quarry could be worth that price?\nGandrel: Truth is like a blade, my friend. We can arm ourselves with it.\nGandrel: Or just as easily find it pressed against our throat. I would not put you in danger.\nPlayer: Maybe I can help with your hunt.\n: True\nGandrel: No. This duty is mine alone. But for such an offer, an answer at least is owed.\nGandrel: I hunt a vampire spawn called Astarion. I'm bound to bring him back to Baldur's Gate - alive.\nGandrel: Though I cannot swear to his condition once my tribe are done with him. Is he known to you?\nPlayer: You can give up your hunt. Astarion's under my protection.\nGandrel: ...I see. Your loyalty is admirable but misplaced. His kind have charm beyond our mortal means to resist.\nGandrel: I can show you who he truly is - if you will just tell me where to find him.\nGandrel: But you're right - he's no true vampire. Not yet. I don't suppose you'll tell me where he is?\nPlayer: I'm not going to help you find him. Back off.",

Curious.\nRugan: If there are valuable goods on the move, The Black Company's always involved.\nRugan: We're the grease that keeps the wheels of commerce turning.\nRugan: And we don't take kindly to people who meddle in our business.\nRugan: This is the point when a clever operator like you accepts my gratitude and walks away.\nPlayer: Enough talking. I'll have that cargo, or I'll have your head.\nPlayer: No. This is the point where I stop asking, and start cutting.\n: False\nRugan: My associates will do worse to me than you ever could.\nRugan: Let's go our separate ways, and be thankful we're all in one piece.\nPlayer: You had your chance. Either way, that cargo's mine.",

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon’s voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar.\nMalus Thorm: See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy.\nMalus Thorm: Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace.\nMalus Thorm: Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver.\nMalus Thorm: Come. Step forward. You are no sister, but that matters none. Every student is welcome.\nPlayer: A student, yes. Do please enlighten me.\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly.\nMalus Thorm: It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nLae'zel: Only a beast of a man toys with his victim. Entertaining, if not efficient.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being?\nMalus Thorm: If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: But you: look how the succour of Shar eludes even you, one who walks faithfully in her shadow. See how painfully present you remain...\nMalus Thorm: We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: Your subject is tainted. Shar's succour must only be granted to the willing.\nMalus Thorm: Hmmm. 'Only the willing may know the Lady's embrace.' You know her teachings well.\nMalus Thorm: And yet, these sisters must exercise their gifts, for the art of absence lies in its execution.\nMalus Thorm: How to proceed, I wonder.\nPlayer: Practice - that's how I got good with a blade. They should spar each other.\nPlayer: Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\n: True\nMalus Thorm: Yes... For are we not all in need of a cure?\nMalus Thorm: The scalpel does not discriminate. Let each and every one of you partake in its soothing journey.\nMalus Thorm: Absence, sisters. Acquaint yourselves.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) Screaming and slashing, the sisters brutally murder each other.\nMalus Thorm: It is a proud moment when one sees one's teachings so lovingly taken to heart.\nMalus Thorm: You are to be commended for their graduation - rewarded with the promised cure.\nMalus Thorm: Come, I will acquaint you with the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nPlayer: You do me an honour, but I am not worthy. Show me the way of Shar - I beg of you.\nPlayer: I would rather acquaint myself - if you show me how.\n: True\nMalus Thorm: Your diligence is exemplary. Very well: your own scalpel you will be.",

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon’s voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar.\nMalus Thorm: See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy.\nMalus Thorm: Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision.

See how painfully present you remain...\nMalus Thorm: We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: Their blades are uneven.

Don't you dare consider it.\nPlayer: What are you going to do with it?\nHavkelaag: Study it, of course. The githyanki have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months.\nHavkelaag: You yourself have no doubt experienced the prejudice of those who assume that, as beings of the Underdark, we are inherently evil.\nHavkelaag: The githyanki face similar prejudice, but I believe, if hatched in a less violent, more intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome its evil predispositions.\nHavkelaag: I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: You're letting your personal biases affect your method. Why assume they're evil?\nHavkelaag: I assume nothing. Innate githyanki cruelty is an established fact - no doubt you witnessed it yourself in the retrieval of the egg itself.\nHavkelaag: When I have a suitable sample for my study, I will, however, prove that the effects of their biological inclination are reversible.\nHavkelaag: Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach:\nHavkelaag: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue.\nHavkelaag: Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: You would teach the child virtue, but rear it without patience. Curious.\nHavkelaag: Tell me, then, philosopher - if patience delays the fostering of the other virtues, can it be rightly called virtuous?\nPlayer: Perhaps not. Patience is important, but cannot impede the other virtues.\nHavkelaag: Then we are in accord - the time for action is now.\nHavkelaag: My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: Sounds pointless. Public opinion will hardly be swayed by such a small experiment.\nHavkelaag: Not at first. But if the experiment proves successful, it must be repeated.

Nothing like a brush with destruction to make one appreciate the majesty of the celestial canvas.\nGale: It's a view I would once have shared with my companion. Though definitely unaccompanied by such revelry.\nGale: She preferred it when we were alone, curled up before a crackling hearth with some ancient, esoteric tome between us, ink glinting in the firelight...\nPlayer: Are you... are you talking about your cat?\nGale: By Ahghairon's lost nose - no!\nGale: Tara is not any cat. She's a tressym. And given your confusion, I'm guessing you've never met one. They're brilliant creatures - fine company for any self-respecting wizard.\nGale: I speak of Tara, my tressym, assistant, my constant companion through all the ills and tribulations my hubris has thrust upon me.\nGale: She'd be most impressed by our efforts saving these tieflings. Proud, even. And I've given her little to be proud of recently.\nGale: After I was afflicted with my condition, I locked myself in my tower for an entire year. I was inconsolable, wallowing in my self-inflicted tragedy.\nGale: I'd given up on myself, but Tara never did. It was her encouragement, her research that led me to my treatment. Once we knew that magically-infused items were the key, she went out to find them for me. She saved my life.\nGale: After so long being cared for by someone else, it feels good to have repaid the favour. Not directly to Tara, but to these poor tieflings. I'm sure she would approve.\nPlayer: What is Tara like?\nGale: 'Smart' does her a disservice. She's a fine wizard in her own right, though somewhat held back by her lack of opposable thumbs.\nGale: You remind me of her somewhat. The same sharp tongue. And sharp teeth.\nGale: I wish she were here for me to make a formal introduction, but I would never ask her to undertake such a journey. She is safer at home.\nGale: Besides, she was always telling me I needed to spread my wings, so to speak. Find mortal friends, instead of hanging onto Mystra's coattails. So that's what I'm doing. I hope.\nPlayer: What if she doesn't like me?\nGale: She'll love you. So long as you don't rub her belly. She hates it when anyone does that.\nPlayer: Not as much as I hate talking about cats. Is there nothing else on your mind?\nGale: Not an animal lover? Nobody's perfect, I suppose.\nGale: Nonetheless, your finer qualities are remarkably plentiful.\nGale: Suffice it to say, I think rather a lot of you. And there aren't many on this plane who I'd give such high praise.\nPlayer: I'm flattered.

I was worried you might have second thoughts after my little confrontation with Mystra.\nGale: Most would think me foolish, deluded even, for daring to pursue dreams of wielding Karsus' Crown. I do not take your faith lightly.\nGale: Words alone are not enough. Permit me to show you. Please, close your eyes a moment.\nPlayer: Close your eyes.\nGale: Astra navigabimus.\nNodeContext: Latin spellcasting - ass-tra navi-gah-mus ('we sail the stars')\nGale: Few mortals ever glimpse what you're about to see. But don't be alarmed - I'm here with you. Now... open your eyes.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Fade up from black as the player opens their eyes to a dazzling spectacle. They and Gale are now sitting in a small boat that shimmers with iridescent light. Unpiloted, it silently meanders through a majestic, infinite starfield.\nGale: The Outer Planes. This is where gods dwell. Where they observe us from afar. Where they make play-things of us.\nGale: They would keep all of this from us - the power, the possibilities. They only want us to serve them, pray to them... and ultimately, die for them.\nGale: But what if we didn't need them? What if we wielded their power instead, and helped ourselves in all the ways they refuse to. I could make that happen. I could make this illusion a reality, with you by my side.\nPlayer: You're still determined to do this, after all that was said?\nGale: How could I not crave this? But I don't want it for myself, alone - I want you at my side, willing and wholehearted.\nGale: The tadpoles, the orb - these threats to our existence - the gods could aid us if they wished, but instead they cower behind Ao. So let us act ourselves.\nNodeContext: Ao = AY-oh (an overlord deity that most gods answer to)\nGale: With the power of the crown, any foe would be rendered impotent. Any obstacle would be dwarfed by our might.\nGale: I used to believe Mystra's forgiveness was worth dying for. But I was wrong. You showed me just how much I have to live for.\nGale: With you, I forget my goddess. I love you.\nGale: Tell me you feel the same way. Tell me you want what I want. Please.\nPlayer: I feel the same. Whatever you need of me, consider it done.\nGale: Right now, I need nothing more than a kiss. Then we'll face what is to come, together. And claim the crown when the time comes.\nPlayer: Let's not grow complacent - that path you speak of is sure to be a dangerous one.\nGale: No doubt it will be - abominably so. As is just about everything we do. But I know we're up to the task. Are you still with me?\nGale: You mean... you want the same as I do?\nNodeContext: Hope rising again\nPlayer: I can't, Gale. This is best forgotten. I love you as you are.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Gale's shoulders sag. The starfield around seems to dim. Distant points of light vanish into the infinite dark.\nGale: What more is there to be said?\nPlayer: Plenty, in time. This doesn't have to be the end for us - just forget the crown.\nGale: But I could be so much more to you.\nNodeContext: crestfallen\nPlayer: You're already everything I need you to be.\nGale: I hope you're right. I truly do. Godly power, perhaps I can live without, but you? You're everything.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: The player and Gale lean in to kiss while seated facing each other.\nGale: You put the stars to shame.

Proud, even. And I've given her little to be proud of recently.\nGale: After I was afflicted with my condition, I locked myself in my tower for an entire year. I was inconsolable, wallowing in my self-inflicted tragedy.\nGale: I'd given up on myself, but Tara never did. It was her encouragement, her research that led me to my treatment. Once we knew that magically-infused items were the key, she went out to find them for me. She saved my life.\nGale: After so long being cared for by someone else, it feels good to have repaid the favour. Not directly to Tara, but to these poor tieflings. I'm sure she would approve.\nPlayer: She must be very smart, to have done all that.\nGale: 'Smart' does her a disservice. She's a fine wizard in her own right, though somewhat held back by her lack of opposable thumbs.\nGale: You remind me of her somewhat. An expression you both share - when she gives in to her more feline qualities, a mouse trapped beneath her paw...\nGale: I wish she were here for me to make a formal introduction, but I would never ask her to undertake such a journey. She is safer at home.\nGale: Besides, she was always telling me I needed to spread my wings, so to speak. Find mortal friends, instead of hanging onto Mystra's coattails. So that's what I'm doing. I hope.\nPlayer: She sounds like a fine animal. One I'd be honoured to know.\nGale: She'll love you. So long as you don't rub her belly. She hates it when anyone does that.\nPlayer: Not as much as I hate talking about cats. Is there nothing else on your mind?\nGale: Not an animal lover? Nobody's perfect, I suppose.\nGale: Nonetheless, your finer qualities are remarkably plentiful.\nGale: Suffice it to say, I think rather a lot of you. And there aren't many on this plane who I'd give such high praise.\nPlayer: I'm flattered. Is your good opinion so hard to come by?\nGale: One doesn't become the most powerful archmage in Waterdeep and lover to the goddess of magic herself by having low standards.\nGale: I assure you, when I tell someone they're wonderful - I mean it. And you are wonderful.\nGale: I think you're rather wonderful. And that's not a word I waste on anyone unworthy of it.\nPlayer: Don't stop now.

    "conversation": "Gale: I must admit, the Crown of Karsus has occupied my every thought since we learned of it.\nGale: If we can seize it, and use it... the possibilities are endless. Yet you haven't uttered a peep one way or the other about it.\nGale: The power to change the world - it may be within our reach. You must have an opinion, surely.\nPlayer: I don't know what to say. How can I respond to something so... immense? It's beyond comprehension.\nGale: Then the fault lies with me, and my inadequate words. Please, allow me to show you instead. Just close your eyes a moment.\nGale: Words alone are not enough. Permit me to show you. Please, close your eyes a moment.\nPlayer: Close your eyes.\nGale: Astra navigabimus.\nNodeContext: Latin spellcasting - ass-tra navi-gah-mus ('we sail the stars')\nGale: Few mortals ever glimpse what you're about to see. But don't be alarmed - I'm here with you. Now... open your eyes.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Fade up from black as the player opens their eyes to a dazzling spectacle. They and Gale are now sitting in a small boat that shimmers with iridescent light. Unpiloted, it silently meanders through a majestic, infinite starfield.\nGale: The Outer Planes. This is where gods dwell. Where they observe us from afar. Where they make play-things of us.\nGale: They would keep all of this from us - the power, the possibilities. They only want us to serve them, pray to them... and ultimately, die for them.\nGale: But what if we didn't need them? What if we wielded their power instead, and helped ourselves in all the ways they refuse to. I could make that happen. I could make this illusion a reality, with you by my side.\nPlayer: Are you saying you want to ascend? Claim godhood?\nGale: No, not like that. I don't want to join them, I want to better them. A god's powers, paired with a mortal conscience, a mortal heart.\nGale: The tadpoles, the orb - these threats to our existence - the gods could aid us if they wished, but instead they cower behind Ao. So let us act ourselves.\nNodeContext: Ao = AY-oh (an overlord deity that most gods answer to)\nGale: With the power of the crown, any foe would be rendered impotent. Any obstacle would be dwarfed by our might.\nGale: I used to believe Mystra's forgiveness was worth dying for. But I was wrong. You showed me just how much I have to live for.\nGale: With you, I forget my goddess. I love you.\nGale: Tell me you feel the same way. Tell me you want what I want. Please.\nPlayer: I love you. But for the man that you are. Not the god you'd pretend to be.\nGale: But think what I offer. The vastness of eternity to explore, the Weave at our fingertips... You would really prefer me as I am?\nPlayer: You're already everything I need you to be.\nGale: I hope you're right. I truly do. Godly power, perhaps I can live without, but you? You're everything.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: The player and Gale lean in to kiss while seated facing each other.\nGale: You put the stars to shame. Let's sit here another while - I want to drink you in.",

    "conversation": "Gale: Even in such fraught times as these, there is peace to be found in the stillness as evening draws in.\nGale: I used to while away many hours just like these with my companion, though in far comfier surrounds.\nGale: She preferred it when we were alone, curled up before a crackling hearth with some ancient, esoteric tome between us, ink glinting in the firelight...\nPlayer: Are you... are you talking about your cat?\nGale: By Ahghairon's lost nose - no!\nGale: Tara is not any cat. She's a tressym. And given your confusion, I'm guessing you've never met one. They're brilliant creatures - fine company for any self-respecting wizard.\nGale: I speak of Tara, my tressym, assistant, my constant companion through all the ills and tribulations my hubris has thrust upon me.\nGale: She'd be most impressed by our efforts saving these tieflings. Proud, even. And I've given her little to be proud of recently.\nGale: After I was afflicted with my condition, I locked myself in my tower for an entire year. I was inconsolable, wallowing in my self-inflicted tragedy.\nGale: I'd given up on myself, but Tara never did. It was her encouragement, her research that led me to my treatment. Once we knew that magically-infused items were the key, she went out to find them for me. She saved my life.\nGale: After so long being cared for by someone else, it feels good to have repaid the favour. Not directly to Tara, but to these poor tieflings. I'm sure she would approve.\nPlayer: She must be very smart, to have done all that.\nGale: 'Smart' does her a disservice. She's a fine wizard in her own right, though somewhat held back by her lack of opposable thumbs.\nGale: You remind me of her somewhat. You share a certain nobility of spirit.\nGale: I wish she were here for me to make a formal introduction, but I would never ask her to undertake such a journey. She is safer at home.\nGale: Besides, she was always telling me I needed to spread my wings, so to speak. Find mortal friends, instead of hanging onto Mystra's coattails. So that's what I'm doing. I hope.\nPlayer: So I remind you of your pet? How romantic...\nGale: I assure you, were you to meet Tara you would see the comparison for the flattery it is. But perhaps that's not a point worth labouring further.\nGale: Suffice it to say, I think rather a lot of you. And there aren't many on this plane who I'd give such high praise.\nPlayer: Being mentioned in the same breath as your pet isn't the compliment you think it is...\nGale: Then let me say it more plainly -\nGale: I think you're rather wonderful. And that's not a word I waste on anyone unworthy of it.\nPlayer: Actually, I was thinking we'd be wonderful together...\nGale: Wait. Are you saying...\nGale: I see. Then perhaps we see each other in the same light after all. A resplendent one, flush with warmth and anticipation, but one which I must shy away from, for now.",

I hope.\nPlayer: She sounds like a fine animal. One I'd be honoured to know.\nGale: She'll love you. So long as you don't rub her belly. She hates it when anyone does that.\nPlayer: She sounds great. But I was hoping I meant more to you than an animal companion...\nGale: I assure you, were you to meet Tara you would see the comparison for the flattery it is. But perhaps that's not a point worth labouring further.\nGale: Suffice it to say, I think rather a lot of you. And there aren't many on this plane who I'd give such high praise.\nPlayer: Being mentioned in the same breath as your pet isn't the compliment you think it is...\nGale: Then let me say it more plainly -\nGale: I think you're rather wonderful. And that's not a word I waste on anyone unworthy of it.\nPlayer: Actually, I was thinking we'd be wonderful together...\nGale: Wait. Are you saying...\nGale: I see. Then perhaps we see each other in the same light after all. A resplendent one, flush with warmth and anticipation, but one which I must shy away from, for now.",

The player approaches Gale and sits down next to him.\nGale: I love this time of night.\nNodeContext: Wistful\nGale: There's an almost reverent silence that accompanies the peak of darkness, when you'd almost believe the dawn will never break.\nGale: The cradle of eternity.\nGale: The timelessness of lovers.\nGale: That most beautiful of fantasies.\nPlayer: I'm afraid all of this is just a fantasy.\nGale: So it is. But a very fine one.\nGale: This may be my last night alive. I wanted it to be under a canopy of beauty and wonder...\nGale: ...and with company to match.\nNodeContext: Full of longing\nGale: I thought this place might bring me peace. I thought it might make the weight of what I must do feel a little lighter... but I am not so sure.\nPlayer: You speak as if this affects you alone. How many will die if you unleash what's inside you?\nGale: Fewer than if the Absolute goes unchecked. I don't want to kill, and I don't want to die... but inaction will lead to bloodshed all the same.\nGale: I am terrified - I will not claim otherwise. My face could scarcely conceal it even if my words sought to deny it.\nGale: There is no point in running from the inevitable. Better to meet it, on my own terms.\nPlayer: Why are you so sure it's inevitable? We haven't even found this 'Heart of the Absolute' yet.\nGale: I can feel it - ever since we set foot in this strange, corrupted land. The closer we get, the heavier my own heart becomes.\nGale: Stay with me a while, will you? Day will come all too soon, even in this place.\nPlayer: I'm not going anywhere, Gale. I'll be by your side, whatever dawn brings.\nGale: One moment with you could sate me for a lifetime, and prise the fear from my heart. I'm so very glad you came, to share this with me.\nGale: I know this is all unreal, but I created it for you. You must know that you're... That you're very special to me.\nGale: If things were different, if we were home, I'd have taken the time to do things properly. To say it all better. But time is short.\nGale: I'm in love with you.\nPlayer: Lean in for a kiss.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: The player and Gale kiss seated on the ground. It's relatively chaste.\nPlayer: You're a good kisser.\nGale: And you're a bad liar. I lived the life of a hermit for some time before I met you - safer for all, but not conducive to pleasures of the flesh.\nGale: I want it to be perfect - to bond with you in the way that gods do... intertwining our spirits in visions of the Weave.\nPlayer: I don't need illusions. I want the Gale standing right in front of me.\nGale: Are you sure...? I could conjure up any sight that you could dream of, and a few you could not. I could use the Weave to make us feel sensations beyond reckoning. I could do more than woo you. I could wow you.\nPlayer: You don't need to impress me, Gale. I'm no deity.",

I was hoping to speak to you - I confess, my thoughts have been somewhat scattered since my audience with Mystra.\nGale: A pity I did not learn all she had to offer, but the fact that she summoned me to her presence is proof enough that the Crown of Karsus is worth pursuing.\nGale: The Karsite Weave could offer more than just power - it could bestow divinity. If I only trust myself to wield it.\nGale: The power to change the world - it may be within our reach. You must have an opinion, surely.\nPlayer: I'm here to support you, no matter what you want.\nGale: Words alone are not enough. Permit me to show you.

They only want us to serve them, pray to them... and ultimately, die for them.\nGale: But what if we didn't need them? What if we wielded their power instead, and helped ourselves in all the ways they refuse to. I could make that happen. I could make this illusion a reality, with you by my side.\nPlayer: You know how I feel. I've already voiced my support.\nGale: Yes, you have. But I want more than your support. I want your heart.\nGale: The tadpoles, the orb - these threats to our existence - the gods could aid us if they wished, but instead they cower behind Ao. So let us act ourselves.\nNodeContext: Ao = AY-oh (an overlord deity that most gods answer to)\nGale: With the power of the crown, any foe would be rendered impotent.

You showed me just how much I have to live for.\nGale: With you, I forget my goddess. I love you.\nGale: Tell me you feel the same way. Tell me you want what I want. Please.\nPlayer: This is wrong, Gale. That power will corrupt you, even if you can seize it.\nGale: It won't, I swear to you. It's merely a tool - a means to an end.\nGale: You told me once to choose you, the one who loved me. That's what this is all about. Do you doubt me?\nPlayer: I don't doubt your motivations, but do this, and you will match Karsus' folly with your own.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Gale's shoulders sag. The starfield around seems to dim. Distant points of light vanish into the infinite dark.\nGale: What more is there to be said?\nPlayer: Plenty, in time. This doesn't have to be the end for us - just forget the crown.\nGale: But I could be so much more to you.\nNodeContext: crestfallen\nPlayer: You're already everything I need you to be.\nGale: I hope you're right. I truly do. Godly power, perhaps I can live without, but you? You're everything.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Player and Gale are seated facing each other but do not lean in to kiss.\nGale: You see me as I am, and do not find me wanting.

The art of conversation. The art of taste, time honoured and newly acquired.\nGale: The art of the body. The exploration and acceptance of the self and the other. The art of the night itself.\nGale: I say we take a page from their book.\nPlayer: You're remarkably upfront about your intentions.\nGale: I'm many things, but coy's not one of them.\nGale: What do you say?\nPlayer: I'm not sure you're the one I want.\nGale: That's because you've yet to find out what you're missing.\nGale: Doubt is a spoilsport.

I was hoping to speak to you - I confess, my thoughts have been somewhat scattered since my audience with Mystra.\nGale: The Karsite Weave could offer more than just power - it could bestow divinity. If I only trust myself to wield it.\nGale: The power to change the world - it may be within our reach. You must have an opinion, surely.\nPlayer: So much power will only prove dangerous. You should forget it.\nGale: But I cannot. You would  not be able to either, if you knew what I knew. Please, allow me to show you. Just close your eyes a moment.\nGale: Words alone are not enough.

I could make this illusion a reality, with you by my side.\nPlayer: You're still determined to do this, after all that was said?\nGale: How could I not crave this? But I don't want it for myself, alone - I want you at my side, willing and wholehearted.\nGale: The tadpoles, the orb - these threats to our existence - the gods could aid us if they wished, but instead they cower behind Ao. So let us act ourselves.\nNodeContext: Ao = AY-oh (an overlord deity that most gods answer to)\nGale: With the power of the crown, any foe would be rendered impotent.

You showed me just how much I have to live for.\nGale: With you, I forget my goddess. I love you.\nGale: Tell me you feel the same way. Tell me you want what I want. Please.\nPlayer: I feel the same. Whatever you need of me, consider it done.\nGale: Right now, I need nothing more than a kiss. Then we'll face what is to come, together. And claim the crown when the time comes.\nPlayer: Let's not grow complacent - that path you speak of is sure to be a dangerous one.\nGale: No doubt it will be - abominably so.
