Her hands are in a prayer position and she's chanting softly as the moonlight dances around her. She exhales, then inhales and breaths in tendrils of shadow, absorbing them. She swallows, then begins hacking coughing. The moonlight dissipates. She quickly goes from seeming like a divine spirit to a normal young woman.\nIsobel: I didn't realise I had an audience.\nFist Marcus: Isobel. This is -\nIsobel: A Sharran.\nNarrator: *Isobel. The same name as Ketheric Thorm's daughter - the one whose sarcophagus you found empty in the family mausoleum.*\nPlayer: Push your Urges down.\nPlayer: Let's not let an ancient squabble interfere with the task at hand.\nIsobel: Not as ancient as you think.\nIsobel: Frankly, I'm surprised you're willing to help us. Your kind aren't known for their decency - particularly when a Sharran curse is our greatest obstacle.\nIsobel: But if you are who I think you are, I'd be a fool to reject your help. The True Soul with... well, a soul. Imagine.\nPlayer: I'm glad you've remembered who needs whose help here.\nIsobel: Oh - aren't you looking for a protection spell?\nPlayer: I am already protected. My Lady shields me from the curse.\nIsobel: For now, perhaps. But Shar can be fickle, and her love can prove fleeting. Do not turn your back on an advantage you may need... even a Selûnite one.\nIsobel: If nothing else, it can aid any companions who travel with you - somehow I doubt Shar's largesse was extended to them.\nPlayer: Ngh... it hurts...\nIsobel: Well! If the Moonmaiden didn't strike me dead for blessing you, she must rather approve of this little alliance.\nIsobel: This will block the lesser effects of the shadow curse, allowing you to traverse the darkness outside... should Shar's own protection falter, that is.\nIsobel: Curious. Surely the Nightsinger could have shielded all her followers, and made this place her domain long ago... yet she only acts now, and aids you alone. I wonder why.\nPlayer: The Dark Lady's works aren't for me to question.\nIsobel: Mustn't question the great shadow mother, must we?\nIsobel: I'll stop needling you, though. You have more important things to do, after all.\nPlayer: I've already been to Moonrise, but I have more work to do indeed.\nIsobel: I imagine so, if Jaheira hasn't gone tearing off into the night.\nPlayer: You're coming with me, cleric.",

A  supply that has now run dry.\nGale: The reality of the matter is that a lone wizard with a chronic impairment such as my own is not in the most ideal of situations with regards to self-defence.\nGale: The manner of artefacts I need are not often found waiting patiently on a shop-keep's shelf. One usually has to lift them delicately from trap-filled tombs or prise them from the hands of violent ne'erdowells.\nGale: There will be danger involved - or great cost.\nPlayer: And at the end of all that I lose a valuable artefact? No thanks.\nGale: I know that what I ask may seem unreasonable, but I promise I only make such a request because it is so incredibly important.\nGale: Please - trust me.

He's looking at the figure intensely.\nPlayer: Pretty.\nGale: Oh! My, you startled me. I... I was miles away.\nNodeContext: Gale is looking at a miniature magical projection of Mystra he's created in his hand in his hand. Startled, he dispells it.\nPlayer: Is everything all right?\nGale: Of course, of course. I was just... practising an incantation.\nPlayer: If you say so.\nGale: I do - because it's through practice that I seek to perfect. To augment.\nGale: Magic is... my life. I've been in touch with the Weave for as long as I can remember. There's nothing like it.\nGale: It's like music, poetry, physical beauty all rolled into one and given expression through the senses.\nGale: That is why I asked you to seek me out, to offer you a taste of such wonders. Would you like me to show you?\nGale: Would you like to experience this?\nPlayer: Magic normally comes to me through prayer, but I don't mind trying.\nGale: Then follow my lead.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: ~Gale walks around behind the player (as though teaching them to fly a kite) and makes a delicate gesture with both hands.\nGale: Now you.\nPlayer: Imitate the gesture quickly and decisively.\n: True\nNarrator: *You feel something strange - like a kind word and a kind touch at the same time. It's warm and comfortable.*\nGale: Excellent. Now repeat after me: Ah-Thran Mystra-Ryl Kantrach-Ao.\nPlayer: An easy incantation. Simply repeat after Gale.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: The visual effect intensifies. There’s the start of a glow, of a rush of beautiful magic.\nNarrator: *Ah, yes: the scent of rosewater and a sense of wellbeing. A sliver of Weave that tastes sweet on the tongue.*\nGale: Very good. Now I want you to picture in your mind the concept of harmony. As true as you can.\nPlayer: Try to hum a familiar tune.\nPlayer: Picture the perfect darkness - to be in the womb of Shar.\n: True\nNarrator: *You see - or is it sense? - the presence of a woman, the woman who hovered over Gale's palm.*\nNarrator: *There's something like the anticipation of a kiss, then the pleasure of being cloaked in peace.*\nNarrator: *You are safe. You are nestled in the cup of her hand.*\nGale: You did it. You're channelling the Weave. How does it feel?\nPlayer: Magical. Sensual, even.\nGale: That it does.\nNarrator: *The Weave connects you. The moment feels intimate.*\nPlayer: Hold on to the moment. It's a good night for intimacy.\nNarrator: *You realise the Weave is making you one. You have but to imagine your desire, and Gale will know it.*\nPlayer: Picture his severed head on a spike.",

Her hands are in a prayer position and she's chanting softly as the moonlight dances around her. She exhales, then inhales and breaths in tendrils of shadow, absorbing them. She swallows, then begins hacking coughing. The moonlight dissipates. She quickly goes from seeming like a divine spirit to a normal young woman.\nIsobel: I didn't realise I had an audience.\nFist Marcus: Isobel. This is -\nIsobel: A Sharran.\nNarrator: *Isobel. The same name as Ketheric Thorm's daughter - the one whose sarcophagus you found empty in the family mausoleum.*\nPlayer: Push your Urges down.\nPlayer: Isobel - Isobel Thorm?\n: False\nIsobel: An unfortunate coincidence. I hope never to meet the wicked man who haemorrhaged shadows over this peaceful village. I've heard you might be the person to stop him.\nIsobel: A True Soul with a soul.

We have a common enemy, after all: Ketheric Thorm.\nIsobel: You'll be needing the protection spell, I presume?\nIsobel: Oh - aren't you looking for a protection spell?\nPlayer: I am already protected. My Lady shields me from the curse.\nIsobel: For now, perhaps. But Shar can be fickle, and her love can prove fleeting. Do not turn your back on an advantage you may need... even a Selûnite one.\nIsobel: If nothing else, it can aid any companions who travel with you - somehow I doubt Shar's largesse was extended to them.\nPlayer: Silently petition Lady Shar for guidance.\nNarrator: *She offers you nothing.*\nIsobel: Well! If the Moonmaiden didn't strike me dead for blessing you, she must rather approve of this little alliance.\nIsobel: This will block the lesser effects of the shadow curse, allowing you to traverse the darkness outside... should Shar's own protection falter, that is.\nIsobel: Curious. Surely the Nightsinger could have shielded all her followers, and made this place her domain long ago... yet she only acts now, and aids you alone. I wonder why.\nPlayer: I don't know what to make of it myself.\nIsobel: I suppose Shar is nothing if not mysterious.\nIsobel: I'll stop needling you, though.

In fact you have one in your possession.\nGale: You know for yourself how hard won such an item was, and it will be no easier when even more are required to assuage my hunger.\nGale: There will be danger involved - or great cost.\nPlayer: Why exactly would I risk either of those things for a wizard I barely know?\nGale: Valid question. If not out of the simple goodness of your heart, then perhaps your own self-interest might be sufficient motivation.\nGale: Having a wizard like me around is quite the boon when facing the perils that stalk these lands. It will be far harder for me to assist you if I can barely stand upright.\nGale: Please - trust me. Your help could be the difference between life and death.\nPlayer: My help was already the difference between life and death where you're concerned. You owe me an explanation.\nGale: I'm afraid it doesn't quite work like that - though of course I'm immensely grateful for any assistance you provide in times of mortal peril. But I must ask more trust of you still.\nGale: Please reconsider.\nPlayer: You aren't going to drop this, are you?\nGale: No.\nPlayer: Neither am I. We'll have to see who gives up first.\nGale: Very well. You're clearly in no mood to be receptive to my request at present.",

Her hands are in a prayer position and she's chanting softly as the moonlight dances around her. She exhales, then inhales and breaths in tendrils of shadow, absorbing them. She swallows, then begins hacking coughing. The moonlight dissipates. She quickly goes from seeming like a divine spirit to a normal young woman.\nIsobel: I didn't realise I had an audience.\nFist Marcus: Isobel. This is -\nIsobel: A Sharran.\nNarrator: *Isobel. The same name as Ketheric Thorm's daughter - the one whose sarcophagus you found empty in the family mausoleum.*\nPlayer: Push your Urges down.\nPlayer: I thought I smelled a Selûnite.\nIsobel: At your service.\nIsobel: Frankly, I'm surprised you're willing to help us. Your kind aren't known for their decency - particularly when a Sharran curse is our greatest obstacle.\nIsobel: But if you are who I think you are, I'd be a fool to reject your help. The True Soul with... well, a soul. Imagine.\nPlayer: I'm glad you've remembered who needs whose help here.\nIsobel: Oh - aren't you looking for a protection spell?\nPlayer: I need nothing from a Selûnite.\nIsobel: But any others who travel with you may not agree. Do it for them at least - you will need all the help you can get out there.\nPlayer: Ngh... it hurts...\nIsobel: Well! If the Moonmaiden didn't strike me dead for blessing you, she must rather approve of this little alliance.\nIsobel: This will block the lesser effects of the shadow curse, allowing you to traverse the darkness outside... should Shar's own protection falter, that is.\nIsobel: Curious. Surely the Nightsinger could have shielded all her followers, and made this place her domain long ago... yet she only acts now, and aids you alone. I wonder why.\nPlayer: That's none of your concern.\nIsobel: I suppose you're right.\nIsobel: I'll stop needling you, though. You have more important things to do, after all.\nPlayer: I've already been to Moonrise, but I have more work to do indeed.\nIsobel: I imagine so, if Jaheira hasn't gone tearing off into the night.\nPlayer: You're coming with me, cleric.",

She swallows, then begins hacking coughing. The moonlight dissipates. She quickly goes from seeming like a divine spirit to a normal young woman.\nIsobel: I didn't realise I had an audience.\nFist Marcus: Isobel. This is -\nIsobel: A Sharran.\nNarrator: *Isobel.

If the Moonmaiden didn't strike me dead for blessing you, she must rather approve of this little alliance.\nIsobel: This will block the lesser effects of the shadow curse, allowing you to traverse the darkness outside... should Shar's own protection falter, that is.\nIsobel: Curious. Surely the Nightsinger could have shielded all her followers, and made this place her domain long ago... yet she only acts now, and aids you alone. I wonder why.\nPlayer: The Dark Lady's works aren't for me to question.\nIsobel: Mustn't question the great shadow mother, must we?\nIsobel: I'll stop needling you, though.

Her hands are in a prayer position and she's chanting softly as the moonlight dances around her. She exhales, then inhales and breaths in tendrils of shadow, absorbing them. She swallows, then begins hacking coughing. The moonlight dissipates. She quickly goes from seeming like a divine spirit to a normal young woman.\nIsobel: I didn't realise I had an audience.\nFist Marcus: Isobel. This is -\nIsobel: A Sharran.\nNarrator: *Isobel. The same name as Ketheric Thorm's daughter - the one whose sarcophagus you found empty in the family mausoleum.*\nPlayer: Push your Urges down.\nPlayer: Let's not let an ancient squabble interfere with the task at hand.\nIsobel: Not as ancient as you think.\nIsobel: Frankly, I'm surprised you're willing to help us. Your kind aren't known for their decency - particularly when a Sharran curse is our greatest obstacle.\nIsobel: But if you are who I think you are, I'd be a fool to reject your help. The True Soul with... well, a soul. Imagine.\nPlayer: I may have the parasite of a True Soul, but not the mind of one.\nIsobel: And that's what makes you essential.\nIsobel: You'll be needing the protection spell, I presume?\nIsobel: Oh - aren't you looking for a protection spell?\nPlayer: Nod. Better to humour her than make an enemy of all in this place. Lady Shar will understand.\nIsobel: Refreshingly pragmatic of you. I sense Shar has offered some amount of protection to you already, but... well, no harm in extra precaution - even from a Selûnite.\nPlayer: It was nothing. Put it out of your mind.\nNarrator: *But was it truly nothing? The pain gripped you tight, robbing you of all composure for a moment...*\nIsobel: Well! If the Moonmaiden didn't strike me dead for blessing you, she must rather approve of this little alliance.\nIsobel: This will block the lesser effects of the shadow curse, allowing you to traverse the darkness outside... should Shar's own protection falter, that is.\nIsobel: Curious. Surely the Nightsinger could have shielded all her followers, and made this place her domain long ago... yet she only acts now, and aids you alone. I wonder why.\nPlayer: I don't know what to make of it myself.\nIsobel: I suppose Shar is nothing if not mysterious.\nIsobel: I'll stop needling you, though. You have more important things to do, after all.\nPlayer: You're coming with me, cleric.",

It's warm and comfortable.*\nGale: Excellent. Now repeat after me: Ah-Thran Mystra-Ryl Kantrach-Ao.\nPlayer: An easy incantation. Simply repeat after Gale.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: The visual effect intensifies. There’s the start of a glow, of a rush of beautiful magic.\nNarrator: *Ah, yes: the scent of rosewater and a sense of wellbeing. A sliver of Weave that tastes sweet on the tongue.*\nGale: Very good. Now I want you to picture in your mind the concept of harmony. As true as you can.\nPlayer: Picture the perfect darkness - to be in the womb of Shar.\n: True\nNarrator: *You see - or is it sense? - the presence of a woman, the woman who hovered over Gale's palm.*\nNarrator: *There's something like the anticipation of a kiss, then the pleasure of being cloaked in peace.*\nNarrator: *You are safe. You are nestled in the cup of her hand.*\nGale: You did it. You're channelling the Weave. How does it feel?\nPlayer: Magical.\nGale: That it does.\nNarrator: *The Weave connects you. The moment feels intimate.*\nPlayer: Hold on to the moment. It's a good night for intimacy.\nNarrator: *You realise the Weave is making you one. You have but to imagine your desire, and Gale will know it.*\nPlayer: Picture kicking him in the gut.",

She swallows, then begins hacking coughing. The moonlight dissipates. She quickly goes from seeming like a divine spirit to a normal young woman.\nIsobel: I didn't realise I had an audience.\nFist Marcus: Isobel. This is -\nIsobel: A Sharran.\nNarrator: *Isobel. The same name as Ketheric Thorm's daughter - the one whose sarcophagus you found empty in the family mausoleum.*\nPlayer: Push your Urges down.\nPlayer: You can tell my allegiance from a look?\nIsobel: It's an aura. Or a lack of one, really.\nIsobel: Frankly, I'm surprised you're willing to help us. Your kind aren't known for their decency - particularly when a Sharran curse is our greatest obstacle.\nIsobel: But if you are who I think you are, I'd be a fool to reject your help. The True Soul with... well, a soul. Imagine.\nPlayer: I won't be spoken to like that by a Selûnite.\nIsobel: We've both got a bitter pill to swallow.

My Lady shields me from the curse.\nIsobel: For now, perhaps. But Shar can be fickle, and her love can prove fleeting. Do not turn your back on an advantage you may need... even a Selûnite one.\nIsobel: If nothing else, it can aid any companions who travel with you - somehow I doubt Shar's largesse was extended to them.\nPlayer: It was nothing. Put it out of your mind.\nNarrator: *But was it truly nothing? The pain gripped you tight, robbing you of all composure for a moment...*\nIsobel: Well! If the Moonmaiden didn't strike me dead for blessing you, she must rather approve of this little alliance.\nIsobel: This will block the lesser effects of the shadow curse, allowing you to traverse the darkness outside... should Shar's own protection falter, that is.\nIsobel: Curious. Surely the Nightsinger could have shielded all her followers, and made this place her domain long ago... yet she only acts now, and aids you alone. I wonder why.\nPlayer: I don't know what to make of it myself.\nIsobel: I suppose Shar is nothing if not mysterious.\nIsobel: I'll stop needling you, though.

Her hands are in a prayer position and she's chanting softly as the moonlight dances around her. She exhales, then inhales and breaths in tendrils of shadow, absorbing them. She swallows, then begins hacking coughing. The moonlight dissipates. She quickly goes from seeming like a divine spirit to a normal young woman.\nIsobel: I didn't realise I had an audience.\nFist Marcus: Isobel. This is -\nIsobel: A Sharran.\nNarrator: *Isobel. The same name as Ketheric Thorm's daughter - the one whose sarcophagus you found empty in the family mausoleum.*\nPlayer: Push your Urges down.\nPlayer: Isobel - Isobel Thorm?\n: False\nIsobel: An unfortunate coincidence. I hope never to meet the wicked man who haemorrhaged shadows over this peaceful village. I've heard you might be the person to stop him.\nIsobel: A True Soul with a soul. Imagine.\nIsobel: But if you are who I think you are, I'd be a fool to reject your help. The True Soul with... well, a soul. Imagine.\nPlayer: I'm glad you've remembered who needs whose help here.\nIsobel: Oh - aren't you looking for a protection spell?\nPlayer: Nod. Better to humour her than make an enemy of all in this place. Lady Shar will understand.\nIsobel: Refreshingly pragmatic of you. I sense Shar has offered some amount of protection to you already, but... well, no harm in extra precaution - even from a Selûnite.\nPlayer: Silently petition Lady Shar for guidance.\nNarrator: *She offers you nothing.*\nIsobel: Well! If the Moonmaiden didn't strike me dead for blessing you, she must rather approve of this little alliance.\nIsobel: This will block the lesser effects of the shadow curse, allowing you to traverse the darkness outside... should Shar's own protection falter, that is.\nIsobel: Curious. Surely the Nightsinger could have shielded all her followers, and made this place her domain long ago... yet she only acts now, and aids you alone. I wonder why.\nPlayer: I don't know what to make of it myself.\nIsobel: I suppose Shar is nothing if not mysterious.\nIsobel: I'll stop needling you, though. You have more important things to do, after all.\nPlayer: I've already been to Moonrise, but I have more work to do indeed.\nIsobel: I imagine so, if Jaheira hasn't gone tearing off into the night.\nPlayer: You're coming with me, cleric.",

The preamble to a civilisation's downfall, committed to parchment by the very hand that wrought its destruction.\nGale: If the crown atop the elder brain was truly forged by Karsus himself, this book will confirm it. All we have to do is turn the page...\nGale: If my suspicions are correct, the crown currently perched atop the elder brain may be one of Karsus' design. And now we hold the very tome that could confirm it.\nPlayer: Don't stand on ceremony - see what it says.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Gale takes book out (of his own inventory),\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Player hands book to Gale\nGale: This isn't what I expected... this is much more. The Crown of Karsus.\nGale: And this - this is no mere journal - it contains Karsus' original plans for the Crown's construction. His designs for godhood.\nPlayer: Karsus? Crown? You might need to catch me up a bit...\nGale: Karsus - I believe I mentioned him before. The child-who-would-become-a-god. He was the most powerful wizard ever known... and he attempted to unseat the goddess of magic herself.\nGale: Only she used the last of her power to block him from the Weave. His magic faltered. The great flying cities of Netheril plunged from the sky. Karsus' Folly.\nGale: That goddess of magic was reborn as Mystra. She ruled on, while Netherese magic was reduced to mere fragments of what Karsus once wielded - artefacts, the most powerful of which appears to be his Crown.\nGale: The book states that the Crown and Netherstones were originally one construct, seemingly sundered at the moment of Karsus' downfall.\nGale: If we can collect the crown's setting, and the three Netherstones, and with the correct invocation of certain spells and gestures detailed in these notes... I think I could reforge it.\nPlayer: To what end?\nGale: To every end you can imagine, and a thousand more beyond.\nGale: Just think of it... the power of the gods in mortal hands at last. We'd be free of doctrine and dogma, confined only by the limits of our imaginations.\nGale: I promise you - the gods will never grant us such a blessing, no matter how much we worship and adore them.\nPlayer: You dismiss the entire pantheon so easily. Not all gods are selfish.\nGale: Some gods may delude themselves into believing they care about their worshippers, but when it comes down to it - we're all expendable. Children to be appeased, not respected.\nGale: I worshipped Mystra loyally for years, and in that time she granted me the barest sliver of the power I was ready to wield.\nGale: Even with the fate of the world at stake, she had little more to offer me than the means of blowing myself up at a more convenient time. She's done nothing to help us.\nGale: Mystra wanted the brain obliterated because of this crown. She fears a world in which such power is beyond her control - ready to be claimed by Karsus' successor.\nPlayer: I thought you were past this kind of temptation, Gale. You know exactly where such over-reaching leads.\nGale: Neither of us can know what truly may be if we don't at least try. Potential is nothing in itself - just a fleeting dream, unless we drag it into the waking world. Please, at least think on it.\nGale: Powerful as he was, Karsus lacked some advantages I can lay claim to.\nGale: I know Mystra - intimately. And I carry a fragment of the Weave itself within my body. Karsus achieved many things, but he never managed that.\nGale: A long road lies ahead before the Crown comes into our possession. All I ask for now is that you not dismiss this possibility out of hand. Please - at least think on it.\nPlayer: Gale - I'm urging you to drop this. This Crown cannot be reforged.\nGale: I see.

It would be something greater. Something divine.\nGale: Just think of it... the power of the gods in mortal hands at last.

I am now but a shadow of my former self.\nSarevok Anchev: Orin is the one you seek to butcher.

Perhaps stronger.\nSarevok Anchev: I have heard of the duel Orin proposed to you. She seeks to sacrifice you in our Father's temple.\nSarevok Anchev: She dreams that your corpse will be her masterpiece, but she forgets - before your incident, you were the true master.\nSarevok Anchev: You were murder.

There's no doubt - the Crown of Karsus is what's controlling the elder brain.\nGale: And this - this is no mere journal - it contains Karsus' original plans for the Crown's construction. His designs for godhood.\nPlayer: Karsus? Crown? You might need to catch me up a bit...\nGale: Karsus. The child-who-would-become-a-god. He was the most powerful wizard ever known... and he attempted to unseat the goddess of magic herself.\nGale: Only she used the last of her power to block him from the Weave. His magic faltered. The great flying cities of Netheril plunged from the sky. Karsus' Folly.\nGale: That goddess of magic was reborn as Mystra. She ruled on, while Netherese magic was reduced to mere fragments of what Karsus once wielded - artefacts, the most powerful of which appears to be his Crown.\nGale: The book states that the Crown and Netherstones were originally one construct, seemingly sundered at the moment of Karsus' downfall.\nGale: If we can collect the crown's setting, and the three Netherstones, and with the correct invocation of certain spells and gestures detailed in these notes... I think I could reforge it.\nPlayer: Aren't you forgetting something? We have to hand the Crown to Raphael...\nGale: A situation I suggest we remedy with the utmost urgency.\nGale: I promise you - the power such an item would give us is worth transcending all nine Hells for. The heavens too, while we're at it.\nNodeContext: Gleam in his eyes, excitement\nGale: Just think of it... the power of the gods in mortal hands at last. We'd be free of doctrine and dogma, confined only by the limits of our imaginations.\nGale: I promise you - the gods will never grant us such a blessing, no matter how much we worship and adore them.\nPlayer: And you think Mystra will let you do this?\nGale: I don't know. Ao does not look kindly on gods meddling in mortal affairs - she may have no choice but to stand by and let events unfold.\nGale: Even with the fate of the world at stake, she had little more to offer me than the means of blowing myself up at a more convenient time. She's done nothing to help us.\nGale: Mystra wanted the brain obliterated because of this crown. She fears a world in which such power is beyond her control - ready to be claimed by Karsus' successor.\nPlayer: And you believe yourself to be that successor?\nGale: Not until this moment, but I can't help beginning to see such a destiny unfold before me.\nGale: Powerful as he was, Karsus lacked some advantages I can lay claim to.\nGale: I know Mystra - intimately. And I carry a fragment of the Weave itself within my body. Karsus achieved many things, but he never managed that.\nGale: A long road lies ahead before the Crown comes into our possession. All I ask for now is that you not dismiss this possibility out of hand. Please - at least think on it.\nPlayer: Gale - I'm urging you to drop this. This Crown cannot be reforged.\nGale: I see.

You should be pleased.\nBalthazar: I take it the breaking of my skeletons was an accident - the living are so clumsy, after all.\nPlayer: I'm pleased to be of service, Balthazar.\nBalthazar: Perhaps you can prove to me that you're more useful alive than dead. You know what's at stake here, I take it?\nBalthazar: But you're here now, and I may be able to put those limbs to work. You know what's at stake here, I take it?\nPlayer: Judging by how you're cowering in here, your survival?\nBalthazar: I do not cower - I plan. I command. I create.\nBalthazar: General Thorm trusts me. He knows I will deliver. He knows I will stand by him long after all others wilt and fall.\nBalthazar: You and all the rest have only one body with which to serve. I have as many as I care to make.\nBalthazar: You, Z'rell, all the rest... you have only one body with which to serve. I have as many as I care to make.\nPlayer: As you mention serving Ketheric, he sent you to find a relic, no?\nBalthazar: General Thorm to you. But yes, recovering the relic is the crux of it. He commands, and I, his humble servant, fulfil that command.\nBalthazar: While you, an infinitely more humble servant, fulfil my command. I will put you to work - as a scout.\nNarrator: *This necromancer has Ketheric's trust. Helping him could be just what you need to gain access to the man himself.*\nPlayer: Jobs like this always go smoother when I know exactly what I'm looking for.\nPlayer: I need more to go on. Why is this relic so important? What does it do?\n: True\nBalthazar: Fine, if it'll spare me your bleating. The relic lends the General his strength, his invulnerability. It must be recovered, before his enemies attempt to exploit it.\nBalthazar: The Nightsong lends the General his strength, his invulnerability. It must be recovered, before his enemies attempt to exploit it.\nPlayer: Sounds like you've good reason to be proud of the Nightsong - tell me more.\nBalthazar: And spoil the surprise? I think not. But let's just say that the Nightsong was a unique specimen even before I began my work...\nBalthazar: Words - even my words - are woefully insufficient. When you see for yourself, you will understand.\nPlayer: What do you need me to do?\nBalthazar: I do not need you, or your help. But you are here in spite of that, so I may as well make use of you.\nBalthazar: The relic is close, but the way is barred and Shar's dead are... uncooperative. Clear the path for me - by blade, cunning, or whatever it takes.\nBalthazar: I will remain here until you have succeeded, or fallen.\nShadowheart: I'd trust this gasbag about as far as I can throw him - which isn't far. But perhaps better to play along, for now.\nPlayer: For jobs like this it's good form to provide your operatives some extra resources.\n: True\nBalthazar: Fine. I will assign Flesh to aid you on your way. Ring this bell...\nBalthazar: ...and he will come.\nBalthazar: My brother is no intellectual powerhouse, but he is strong, loyal and punctual. Should a fight turn against you, remember the bell.\nPlayer: Keep it - this is your problem, not mine.\nBalthazar: This is not a problem - it is an opportunity.

I worshipped that woman.\nPlayer: An old flame?\nNightwarden Minthara: Jealous? You needn't be -  when Orin is in my hands, her agony will nourish me.\nNightwarden Minthara: She is the iblith who indoctrinated me with the Absolute's lies.\nNightwarden Minthara: Indeed, she is the one who indoctrinated me with the Absolute's lies.\nPlayer: What do you remember of your indoctrination?\nNightwarden Minthara: When I first visited Moonrise, I stood before the Absolute in awe.\nNightwarden Minthara: It was more of an idea than an entity. Pure love. Total power.\nNightwarden Minthara: Orin was by my side. She told me that god had chosen me to be a True Soul. Blessed and adored.\nNightwarden Minthara: Now I know that those memories are lies.\nNightwarden Minthara: There was no god. Orin held me down in a cocoon of flesh, while a mind flayer forced a parasite into my brain. And she laughed at my fear.\nNightwarden Minthara: I will find her, I will murder her. And I will smile.\nPlayer: We'll be heroes - the saviours of Baldur's Gate.\nNightwarden Minthara: Let them think that. There is a short path from saviour to ruler - a short and bloody path. I know it well, and we will walk it together.\nNightwarden Minthara: But Baldur's Gate is a mere bauble. We have the chance to seize something much greater. Surely you see it?\nNightwarden Minthara: In killing Ketheric, we fractured the cult's leadership. When we break the other Chosen and claim their Netherstones, we can take control.\nPlayer: A bold gamble. How can you be sure it's possible?\nNightwarden Minthara: I would have thought this entire conspiracy of gods and monsters to be impossible if I had not seen it for myself.\nNightwarden Minthara: We may fail, but we must try.\nNightwarden Minthara: The power of the enslaved elder brain could reshape the world. We could reshape the world.\nPlayer: I fear we could lose everything if we try to take control.\nNightwarden Minthara: Nothing worthwhile ever came without loss. But together we have the strength to decide who loses. And to make sure it is not us.\nNightwarden Minthara: You are not stupid. When we reach Baldur's Gate and face the other Chosen, you will see that my way is the right one.\nPlayer: Maybe I'll change your mind.\nNightwarden Minthara: The elder brain is the only thing that has ever managed to change my mind. You're welcome to try.\nNightwarden Minthara: We are bound, then, to travel together, even if we do not yet agree on our ultimate purpose.\nNightwarden Minthara: There is yet one thing about you that troubles me, though.

    "conversation": "[description] CinematicNodeContext: Player hands book to Gale\nGale: That devil Raphael was telling the truth. There's no doubt - the Crown of Karsus is what's controlling the elder brain.\nGale: And this - this is no mere journal - it contains Karsus' original plans for the Crown's construction. His designs for godhood.\nPlayer: Karsus? Crown? You might need to catch me up a bit...\nGale: Karsus. The child-who-would-become-a-god. He was the most powerful wizard ever known... and he attempted to unseat the goddess of magic herself.\nGale: Only she used the last of her power to block him from the Weave. His magic faltered. The great flying cities of Netheril plunged from the sky. Karsus' Folly.\nGale: That goddess of magic was reborn as Mystra. She ruled on, while Netherese magic was reduced to mere fragments of what Karsus once wielded - artefacts, the most powerful of which appears to be his Crown.\nGale: The book states that the Crown and Netherstones were originally one construct, seemingly sundered at the moment of Karsus' downfall.\nGale: If we can collect the crown's setting, and the three Netherstones, and with the correct invocation of certain spells and gestures detailed in these notes... I think I could reforge it.\nPlayer: We already know the crown's dangerous. Wouldn't that make things worse?\nGale: Worse? It could be the best thing that ever happened to me. To us.\nGale: Just think of it... the power of the gods in mortal hands at last. We'd be free of doctrine and dogma, confined only by the limits of our imaginations.\nGale: I promise you - the gods will never grant us such a blessing, no matter how much we worship and adore them.\nPlayer: And you think Mystra will let you do this?\nGale: I don't know. Ao does not look kindly on gods meddling in mortal affairs - she may have no choice but to stand by and let events unfold.\nGale: Even with the fate of the world at stake, she had little more to offer me than the means of blowing myself up at a more convenient time. She's done nothing to help us.\nGale: Mystra wanted the brain obliterated because of this crown. She fears a world in which such power is beyond her control - ready to be claimed by Karsus' successor.\nPlayer: Or to destroy the next wizard who attempts it. The attempt would kill you as it killed Karsus.\nGale: Do you think I had not considered that? I have no intention of repeating his folly.\nGale: Powerful as he was, Karsus lacked some advantages I can lay claim to.\nGale: I know Mystra - intimately. And I carry a fragment of the Weave itself within my body. Karsus achieved many things, but he never managed that.\nGale: A long road lies ahead before the Crown comes into our possession. All I ask for now is that you not dismiss this possibility out of hand. Please - at least think on it.\nPlayer: Gale - I'm urging you to drop this. This Crown cannot be reforged.\nGale: I see. I suppose I am asking you to take a leap of faith even the most loyal of companions might struggle to land gracefully.",

He commands, and I, his humble servant, fulfil that command.\nBalthazar: While you, an infinitely more humble servant, fulfil my command. I will put you to work - as a scout.\nNarrator: *This necromancer has Ketheric's trust. Helping him could be just what you need to gain access to the man himself.*\nPlayer: Jobs like this always go smoother when I know exactly what I'm looking for.\nPlayer: I need more to go on. Why is this relic so important? What does it do?\n: True\nBalthazar: Fine, if it'll spare me your bleating. The relic lends the General his strength, his invulnerability. It must be recovered, before his enemies attempt to exploit it.\nBalthazar: The Nightsong lends the General his strength, his invulnerability. It must be recovered, before his enemies attempt to exploit it.\nPlayer: You need my help?\nBalthazar: I do not need you, or your help. But you are here in spite of that, so I may as well make use of you.\nBalthazar: The relic is close, but the way is barred and Shar's dead are... uncooperative. Clear the path for me - by blade, cunning, or whatever it takes.\nBalthazar: I will remain here until you have succeeded, or fallen.\nShadowheart: I'd trust this gasbag about as far as I can throw him - which isn't far.

There's no doubt - the Crown of Karsus is what's controlling the elder brain.\nGale: And this - this is no mere journal - it contains Karsus' original plans for the Crown's construction. His designs for godhood.\nPlayer: The design for self-destruction, more like. Didn't this crown kill Karsus?\nGale: Not exactly. It was what he did with it that sealed his fate, and for a time, that of magic itself. The Crown was merely the means.\nGale: The book states that the Crown and Netherstones were originally one construct, seemingly sundered at the moment of Karsus' downfall.\nGale: If we can collect the crown's setting, and the three Netherstones, and with the correct invocation of certain spells and gestures detailed in these notes... I think I could reforge it.\nPlayer: Aren't you forgetting something? We have to hand the Crown to Raphael...\nGale: A situation I suggest we remedy with the utmost urgency.\nGale: I promise you - the power such an item would give us is worth transcending all nine Hells for. The heavens too, while we're at it.\nNodeContext: Gleam in his eyes, excitement\nGale: Just think of it... the power of the gods in mortal hands at last. We'd be free of doctrine and dogma, confined only by the limits of our imaginations.\nGale: I promise you - the gods will never grant us such a blessing, no matter how much we worship and adore them.\nPlayer: And you think Mystra will let you do this?\nGale: I don't know. Ao does not look kindly on gods meddling in mortal affairs - she may have no choice but to stand by and let events unfold.\nGale: Even with the fate of the world at stake, she had little more to offer me than the means of blowing myself up at a more convenient time. She's done nothing to help us.\nGale: Mystra wanted the brain obliterated because of this crown. She fears a world in which such power is beyond her control - ready to be claimed by Karsus' successor.\nPlayer: And you believe yourself to be that successor?\nGale: Not until this moment, but I can't help beginning to see such a destiny unfold before me.\nGale: Powerful as he was, Karsus lacked some advantages I can lay claim to.\nGale: I know Mystra - intimately. And I carry a fragment of the Weave itself within my body. Karsus achieved many things, but he never managed that.\nGale: A long road lies ahead before the Crown comes into our possession. All I ask for now is that you not dismiss this possibility out of hand. Please - at least think on it.\nPlayer: Gale - I'm urging you to drop this. This Crown cannot be reforged.\nGale: I see. I suppose I am asking you to take a leap of faith even the most loyal of companions might struggle to land gracefully.",

You know what's at stake here, I take it?\nBalthazar: But you're here now, and I may be able to put those limbs to work. You know what's at stake here, I take it?\nPlayer: Judging by how you're cowering in here, your survival?\nBalthazar: I do not cower - I plan. I command.

He knows I will stand by him long after all others wilt and fall.\nBalthazar: You, Z'rell, all the rest... you have only one body with which to serve. I have as many as I care to make.\nPlayer: As you mention serving Ketheric, he sent you to find a relic, no?\nBalthazar: General Thorm to you. But yes, recovering the relic is the crux of it. He commands, and I, his humble servant, fulfil that command.\nBalthazar: While you, an infinitely more humble servant, fulfil my command. I will put you to work - as a scout.\nNarrator: *This necromancer has Ketheric's trust. Helping him might just be the best way to gain access to Moonrise Towers.*\nNarrator: *This necromancer has Ketheric's trust. Helping him could be just what you need to gain access to the man himself.*\nPlayer: A scout is little good if they don't know what to look for. What does this relic do?\nPlayer: I need more to go on. Why is this relic so important? What does it do?\n: True\nBalthazar: Fine, if it'll spare me your bleating. The relic lends the General his strength, his invulnerability. It must be recovered, before his enemies attempt to exploit it.\nBalthazar: The Nightsong lends the General his strength, his invulnerability. It must be recovered, before his enemies attempt to exploit it.\nPlayer: You need my help?\nBalthazar: I do not need you, or your help. But you are here in spite of that, so I may as well make use of you.\nBalthazar: The Nightsong is close, but the way is barred and Shar's dead are... uncooperative. Clear the path for me - by blade, cunning, or whatever it takes.\nBalthazar: I will remain here until you have succeeded, or fallen.\nShadowheart: I'd trust this gasbag about as far as I can throw him - which isn't far. But perhaps better to play along, for now.\nPlayer: For jobs like this it's good form to provide your operatives some extra resources.\n: True\nBalthazar: Fine. I will assign Flesh to aid you on your way. Ring this bell...\nBalthazar: ...and he will come.\nBalthazar: My brother is no intellectual powerhouse, but he is strong, loyal and punctual. Should a fight turn against you, remember the bell.\nPlayer: Keep it - this is your problem, not mine.\nBalthazar: This is not a problem - it is an opportunity. And it is not a choice either - you will obey.\nPlayer: Fine. I'll see what I can do.\nPlayer: I'll see what I can do.",

    "conversation": "Gale: If my suspicions are correct, the crown currently perched atop the elder brain may be one of Karsus' design. And now we hold the very tome that could confirm it.\nPlayer: Don't stand on ceremony - see what it says.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Gale takes book out (of his own inventory),\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Player hands book to Gale\nGale: That devil Raphael was telling the truth. There's no doubt - the Crown of Karsus is what's controlling the elder brain.\nGale: And this - this is no mere journal - it contains Karsus' original plans for the Crown's construction. His designs for godhood.\nPlayer: Godhood? I know crowns are an ego boost, but that's ridiculous.\nGale: Gods have ascended through far stranger means - a circle drawn on a globe, a walk in a swamp, the destruction of a magical stone. Why not with a symbol of such innate authority?\nNodeContext: Doesnt' really want to waste time justifying this to you\nGale: The book states that the Crown and Netherstones were originally one construct, seemingly sundered at the moment of Karsus' downfall.\nGale: If we can collect the crown's setting, and the three Netherstones, and with the correct invocation of certain spells and gestures detailed in these notes... I think I could reforge it.\nPlayer: You 'think'? What happens if you fail?\nGale: Well, there'd be risk in such an endeavour, but only proportionate to the reward.\nNodeContext: Doesn't want to get bogged down by doubts like these\nGale: Just think of it... the power of the gods in mortal hands at last. We'd be free of doctrine and dogma, confined only by the limits of our imaginations.\nGale: I promise you - the gods will never grant us such a blessing, no matter how much we worship and adore them.\nPlayer: You dismiss the entire pantheon so easily. Not all gods are selfish.\nGale: Some gods may delude themselves into believing they care about their worshippers, but when it comes down to it - we're all expendable. Children to be appeased, not respected.\nGale: I worshipped Mystra loyally for years, and in that time she granted me the barest sliver of the power I was ready to wield.\nGale: Even with the fate of the world at stake, she had little more to offer me than the means of blowing myself up at a more convenient time. She's done nothing to help us.\nGale: Mystra wanted the brain obliterated because of this crown. She fears a world in which such power is beyond her control - ready to be claimed by Karsus' successor.\nPlayer: I thought you were past this kind of temptation, Gale. You know exactly where such over-reaching leads.\nGale: Neither of us can know what truly may be if we don't at least try. Potential is nothing in itself - just a fleeting dream, unless we drag it into the waking world. Please, at least think on it.\nGale: Powerful as he was, Karsus lacked some advantages I can lay claim to.\nGale: I know Mystra - intimately. And I carry a fragment of the Weave itself within my body. Karsus achieved many things, but he never managed that.\nGale: A long road lies ahead before the Crown comes into our possession. All I ask for now is that you not dismiss this possibility out of hand. Please - at least think on it.\nPlayer: What you're suggesting is blasphemy. You'd be wise to banish these notions from your head.\nGale: I see. I suppose I am asking you to take a leap of faith even the most loyal of companions might struggle to land gracefully.",

And now we hold the very tome that could confirm it.\nPlayer: Don't stand on ceremony - see what it says.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Gale takes book out (of his own inventory),\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Player hands book to Gale\nGale: That devil Raphael was telling the truth. There's no doubt - the Crown of Karsus is what's controlling the elder brain.\nGale: And this - this is no mere journal - it contains Karsus' original plans for the Crown's construction. His designs for godhood.\nPlayer: Karsus? Crown? You might need to catch me up a bit...\nGale: Karsus - I believe I mentioned him before. The child-who-would-become-a-god. He was the most powerful wizard ever known... and he attempted to unseat the goddess of magic herself.\nGale: Only she used the last of her power to block him from the Weave. His magic faltered. The great flying cities of Netheril plunged from the sky. Karsus' Folly.\nGale: That goddess of magic was reborn as Mystra. She ruled on, while Netherese magic was reduced to mere fragments of what Karsus once wielded - artefacts, the most powerful of which appears to be his Crown.\nGale: The book states that the Crown and Netherstones were originally one construct, seemingly sundered at the moment of Karsus' downfall.\nGale: If we can collect the crown's setting, and the three Netherstones, and with the correct invocation of certain spells and gestures detailed in these notes... I think I could reforge it.\nPlayer: You 'think'? What happens if you fail?\nGale: Well, there'd be risk in such an endeavour, but only proportionate to the reward.\nNodeContext: Doesn't want to get bogged down by doubts like these\nGale: Just think of it... the power of the gods in mortal hands at last. We'd be free of doctrine and dogma, confined only by the limits of our imaginations.\nGale: I promise you - the gods will never grant us such a blessing, no matter how much we worship and adore them.\nPlayer: Don't dare to assume why I worship. Not all of us share such transactional relationships with our gods.\nGale: But do you not expect something in return for your devotion? Some favour, some stir of courage, some response?\nGale: I worshipped Mystra loyally for years, and in that time she granted me the barest sliver of the power I was ready to wield.\nGale: Even with the fate of the world at stake, she had little more to offer me than the means of blowing myself up at a more convenient time. She's done nothing to help us.\nGale: Mystra wanted the brain obliterated because of this crown. She fears a world in which such power is beyond her control - ready to be claimed by Karsus' successor.\nPlayer: Or to destroy the next wizard who attempts it. The attempt would kill you as it killed Karsus.\nGale: Do you think I had not considered that? I have no intention of repeating his folly.\nGale: Powerful as he was, Karsus lacked some advantages I can lay claim to.\nGale: I know Mystra - intimately. And I carry a fragment of the Weave itself within my body. Karsus achieved many things, but he never managed that.\nGale: A long road lies ahead before the Crown comes into our possession. All I ask for now is that you not dismiss this possibility out of hand. Please - at least think on it.\nPlayer: Gale - I'm urging you to drop this. This Crown cannot be reforged.\nGale: I see.

It must be recovered, before his enemies attempt to exploit it.\nPlayer: You need my help?\nBalthazar: I do not need you, or your help. But you are here in spite of that, so I may as well make use of you.\nBalthazar: The Nightsong is close, but the way is barred and Shar's dead are... uncooperative. Clear the path for me - by blade, cunning, or whatever it takes.\nBalthazar: I will remain here until you have succeeded, or fallen.\nShadowheart: I'd trust this gasbag about as far as I can throw him - which isn't far. But perhaps better to play along, for now.\nPlayer: You have resources to spare - give me something to aid my search.\n: True\nBalthazar: Fine. I will assign Flesh to aid you on your way.

I'd do anything to take it back. Anything.\nPlayer: Stab yourself. Rip your stomach open. Feel the pain of your friends - only then will you be free.\nPlayer: Anything? Then hurt yourself as Ben and Marc did - stab yourself.\n: True\nMadeline: Like... this?\nNodeContext: Madeline draws a blade from behind her and holds it in front of her stomach, blade pointed towards her stomach.

I'm sorry.\nNodeContext: Ah! is a noise of pain as she stabs herself in the stomach and then pulls out the knife. 'I'm sorry' is said in clear pain.\nMadeline: Argh.

And now we hold the very tome that could confirm it.\nPlayer: Give the book to Gale.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Player hands book to Gale\nGale: That devil Raphael was telling the truth. There's no doubt - the Crown of Karsus is what's controlling the elder brain.\nGale: And this - this is no mere journal - it contains Karsus' original plans for the Crown's construction. His designs for godhood.\nPlayer: The design for self-destruction, more like. Didn't this crown kill Karsus?\nGale: Not exactly. It was what he did with it that sealed his fate, and for a time, that of magic itself. The Crown was merely the means.\nGale: The book states that the Crown and Netherstones were originally one construct, seemingly sundered at the moment of Karsus' downfall.\nGale: If we can collect the crown's setting, and the three Netherstones, and with the correct invocation of certain spells and gestures detailed in these notes... I think I could reforge it.\nPlayer: To what end?\nGale: To every end you can imagine, and a thousand more beyond.\nGale: Just think of it... the power of the gods in mortal hands at last. We'd be free of doctrine and dogma, confined only by the limits of our imaginations.\nGale: I promise you - the gods will never grant us such a blessing, no matter how much we worship and adore them.\nPlayer: Mortals are far better guardians of their fates than the gods. We have more to lose.\nGale: Then you're already wiser than me. That's a lesson I've only recently learned.\nGale: I worshipped Mystra loyally for years, and in that time she granted me the barest sliver of the power I was ready to wield.\nGale: Even with the fate of the world at stake, she had little more to offer me than the means of blowing myself up at a more convenient time. She's done nothing to help us.\nGale: Mystra wanted the brain obliterated because of this crown. She fears a world in which such power is beyond her control - ready to be claimed by Karsus' successor.\nPlayer: And you believe yourself to be that successor?\nGale: Not until this moment, but I can't help beginning to see such a destiny unfold before me.\nGale: Powerful as he was, Karsus lacked some advantages I can lay claim to.\nGale: I know Mystra - intimately. And I carry a fragment of the Weave itself within my body. Karsus achieved many things, but he never managed that.\nGale: A long road lies ahead before the Crown comes into our possession. All I ask for now is that you not dismiss this possibility out of hand. Please - at least think on it.\nPlayer: Gale - I'm urging you to drop this. This Crown cannot be reforged.\nGale: I see. I suppose I am asking you to take a leap of faith even the most loyal of companions might struggle to land gracefully.",

You should be pleased.\nBalthazar: I take it the breaking of my skeletons was an accident - the living are so clumsy, after all.\nPlayer: Another True Soul was looking for you. Nere - I aided him in the Underdark.\nBalthazar: Ah, it was you who pulled his sorry carcass from the rubble. You should have left him there.\nBalthazar: The miserable worm tried to kill me, hoping to take all the glory of this mission for himself.\nBalthazar: Dull, dull, dull. Nere was never cut out to be a True Soul - he's a very obedient corpse, though.\nBalthazar: Perhaps you can prove to me that you're more useful alive than dead. You know what's at stake here, I take it?\nBalthazar: But you're here now, and I may be able to put those limbs to work. You know what's at stake here, I take it?\nPlayer: Nere mentioned that you were seeking access to the Temple. Looks like you found it.\nBalthazar: Perhaps you'd be more useful dead than alive if you don't even know what I'm seeking here.\nBalthazar: But you're here now, and I may be able to put those limbs to work. You know what's at stake here, I take it?\nPlayer: Judging by how you're cowering in here, your survival?\nBalthazar: I do not cower - I plan. I command. I create.\nBalthazar: General Thorm trusts me. He knows I will deliver. He knows I will stand by him long after all others wilt and fall.\nBalthazar: You, Z'rell, all the rest... you have only one body with which to serve. I have as many as I care to make.\nPlayer: Yet you seem no closer to retrieving the Nightsong? I read your notes - very interesting.\nBalthazar: Interesting, and private. Give me one reason why I shouldn't have my creations kill you right now, thief.\nPlayer: I outmatch you in both brains and magic - you need me.\nPlayer: It's simple - you need me. Don't pretend otherwise.\n: True\nBalthazar: ...Fine. Your usefulness may outweigh your insolence - for now. There are much grander things at stake.\nNodeContext: A pause before 'fine' - weighing up the player's fate.\nBalthazar: The Nightsong is my finest creation - if I never exceed myself, I will still die happy. Not that I ever intend to do something as gauche as truly dying, of course.\nBalthazar: Now, given your prying nature, I have work for you, as a scout.\nBalthazar: The Nightsong lends the General his strength, his invulnerability. It must be recovered, before his enemies attempt to exploit it.\nPlayer: Sounds like you've good reason to be proud of the Nightsong - tell me more.\nBalthazar: And spoil the surprise? I think not. But let's just say that the Nightsong was a unique specimen even before I began my work...\nBalthazar: Words - even my words - are woefully insufficient. When you see for yourself, you will understand.\nPlayer: What do you need me to do?\nBalthazar: I do not need you, or your help. But you are here in spite of that, so I may as well make use of you.\nBalthazar: The Nightsong is close, but the way is barred and Shar's dead are... uncooperative. Clear the path for me - by blade, cunning, or whatever it takes.\nBalthazar: I will remain here until you have succeeded, or fallen.\nShadowheart: I'd trust this gasbag about as far as I can throw him - which isn't far. But perhaps better to play along, for now.\nPlayer: I'll see what I can do.",

Astarion's been dealt with.\nGandrel: You know him? Not too well, I think, if you believe he is so easily slain. He could be stalking your camp at this very moment.\nGandrel: Perhaps you could tell me where to look, and I could ensure peace of mind for us both?\nGandrel: But you're right - he's no true vampire.

    "conversation": "Gale: I finally have the tome I needed. Such knowledge - such power - contained in such a small object.\nGale: The Annals of Karsus... The preamble to a civilisation's downfall, committed to parchment by the very hand that wrought its destruction.\nGale: If the crown atop the elder brain was truly forged by Karsus himself, this book will confirm it. All we have to do is turn the page...\nGale: If my suspicions are correct, the crown currently perched atop the elder brain may be one of Karsus' design. And now we hold the very tome that could confirm it.\nPlayer: Don't stand on ceremony - see what it says.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Gale takes book out (of his own inventory),\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Player hands book to Gale\nGale: This isn't what I expected... this is much more. The Crown of Karsus.\nGale: And this - this is no mere journal - it contains Karsus' original plans for the Crown's construction. His designs for godhood.\nPlayer: Karsus? Crown? You might need to catch me up a bit...\nGale: Karsus - I believe I mentioned him before. The child-who-would-become-a-god. He was the most powerful wizard ever known... and he attempted to unseat the goddess of magic herself.\nGale: Only she used the last of her power to block him from the Weave. His magic faltered. The great flying cities of Netheril plunged from the sky. Karsus' Folly.\nGale: That goddess of magic was reborn as Mystra. She ruled on, while Netherese magic was reduced to mere fragments of what Karsus once wielded - artefacts, the most powerful of which appears to be his Crown.\nGale: The book states that the Crown and Netherstones were originally one construct, seemingly sundered at the moment of Karsus' downfall.\nGale: If we can collect the crown's setting, and the three Netherstones, and with the correct invocation of certain spells and gestures detailed in these notes... I think I could reforge it.\nPlayer: Aren't you forgetting something? We have to hand the Crown to Raphael...\nGale: A situation I suggest we remedy with the utmost urgency.\nGale: I promise you - the power such an item would give us is worth transcending all nine Hells for. The heavens too, while we're at it.\nNodeContext: Gleam in his eyes, excitement\nGale: Just think of it... the power of the gods in mortal hands at last. We'd be free of doctrine and dogma, confined only by the limits of our imaginations.\nGale: I promise you - the gods will never grant us such a blessing, no matter how much we worship and adore them.\nPlayer: And you think Mystra will let you do this?\nGale: I don't know. Ao does not look kindly on gods meddling in mortal affairs - she may have no choice but to stand by and let events unfold.\nGale: Even with the fate of the world at stake, she had little more to offer me than the means of blowing myself up at a more convenient time. She's done nothing to help us.\nGale: Mystra wanted the brain obliterated because of this crown. She fears a world in which such power is beyond her control - ready to be claimed by Karsus' successor.\nPlayer: And you believe yourself to be that successor?\nGale: Not until this moment, but I can't help beginning to see such a destiny unfold before me.\nGale: Powerful as he was, Karsus lacked some advantages I can lay claim to.\nGale: I know Mystra - intimately. And I carry a fragment of the Weave itself within my body. Karsus achieved many things, but he never managed that.\nGale: A long road lies ahead before the Crown comes into our possession. All I ask for now is that you not dismiss this possibility out of hand. Please - at least think on it.\nPlayer: What you're suggesting is blasphemy. You'd be wise to banish these notions from your head.\nGale: I see. I suppose I am asking you to take a leap of faith even the most loyal of companions might struggle to land gracefully.",

You're aware of the monster inside you. You don't bow to the Absolute, like the True Souls do...\nHalsin: How is this possible...?\nPlayer: I think this artefact has something to do with it.\nHalsin: Hmmm... that looks very alien. As alien as the mind flayers. They do not belong on this world.\nHalsin: You weren't speaking lightly when you said you needed help. Let me tell you what I know.\nHalsin: I've been studying these parasites for a while now. Ever since I discovered these so-called True Souls are infected with them.\nHalsin: Someone is using very powerful magic to modify these tadpoles. They are using them to exert control over the infected.\nHalsin: I'm sorry to say, I can't undo that magic, which means I can't cure you. But that doesn't mean I can't help.\nHalsin: I didn't find what I came here for - a way to remove the tadpoles - but I found the next best thing. I found out where they come from.\nHalsin: That must be where these enchantments are placed on them, and it's where you'll find your cure.\nPlayer: Tell me what you've learned about the tadpoles' origins.\nHalsin: I overheard that the cultists are sending all of their captives to Moonrise Towers.\nHalsin: Innocents go in, True Souls come out. Given that all of these True Souls are infected, it has to be the source of this magic.\nHalsin: If you want to find a cure, you must head there and discover how the tadpoles are being manipulated.\nPlayer: You seem to know a lot about this. Will you come with me to Moonrise?\nHalsin: I wish I could, but there's still work I've yet to finish - blood I've yet to spill.\nHalsin: I've no right to ask more of you... but if you could help me, I'd be free to join your journey to Moonrise.\nHalsin: I cannot allow these butchers to threaten my grove. The natural order must be protected.\nPlayer: All right. How do I help?\nHalsin: My thanks. If you prevail, I'll owe you the debt of a lifetime.\nHalsin: It's too late to stop things from here - the goblins are already marching on the grove in force.\nHalsin: You must get ahead of them, muster the defences.\nPlayer: Very well.

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon’s voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar.\nMalus Thorm: See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy.\nMalus Thorm: Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace.\nMalus Thorm: Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver.\nMalus Thorm: Come. Step forward. I can see the love of Shar darken your eyes. Be welcome.\nPlayer: May Shar guide your blessing hands.\nMalus Thorm: And the rough vessels that are yours.\nMalus Thorm: Tell me, what is the guiding principle of the goddess?\nPlayer: Forgetfulness.\nMalus Thorm: I profess there is another more profound.\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly.\nMalus Thorm: It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nLae'zel: Only a beast of a man toys with his victim. Entertaining, if not efficient.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being?\nMalus Thorm: If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: You are well on your way. But one white orb disfigures you still. Let us finish the cure.\nMalus Thorm: We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: Their blades are uneven. Efficient surgery will require further training.\nMalus Thorm: Their incisions are, as yet, still streaked with imprecision - that much I must concede.\nMalus Thorm: How to steady their hands, I wonder.\nPlayer: They need a better subject to practise on first. Not a student, but a master.\n: True\nMalus Thorm: I see now. By example I must edify and quell the light that blinds us.",

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon’s voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar.\nMalus Thorm: See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy.\nMalus Thorm: Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace.\nMalus Thorm: Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver.\nMalus Thorm: Come. Step forward. You are no sister, but that matters none. Every student is welcome.\nPlayer: You will stop this sick spectacle at once.\nMalus Thorm: Sick. Quite. But on the cusp of a cure:\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly.\nMalus Thorm: It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nGale: Gods, what living nightmare is this?\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being?\nMalus Thorm: If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: You are well on your way. But one white orb disfigures you still. Let us finish the cure.\nMalus Thorm: We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: Your subject is tainted. Shar's succour must only be granted to the willing.\nMalus Thorm: Hmmm. 'Only the willing may know the Lady's embrace.' You know her teachings well.\nMalus Thorm: And yet, these sisters must exercise their gifts, for the art of absence lies in its execution.\nMalus Thorm: How to proceed, I wonder.\nPlayer: Practice - that's how I got good with a blade. They should spar each other.\nPlayer: Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\n: True\nMalus Thorm: Yes... For are we not all in need of a cure?\nMalus Thorm: The scalpel does not discriminate. Let each and every one of you partake in its soothing journey.\nMalus Thorm: Absence, sisters. Acquaint yourselves.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) Screaming and slashing, the sisters brutally murder each other.\nMalus Thorm: It is a proud moment when one sees one's teachings so lovingly taken to heart.\nMalus Thorm: You are to be commended for their graduation - rewarded with the promised cure.\nMalus Thorm: Come, I will acquaint you with the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nPlayer: You do me an honour, but I am not worthy. Show me the way of Shar - I beg of you.\nPlayer: I would rather acquaint myself - if you show me how.\n: True\nMalus Thorm: Your diligence is exemplary. Very well: your own scalpel you will be.",

And I've given her precious little to be proud of recently.\nGale: She has a good heart, and she would recognise the same in your actions here. I'm sure she'd approve of me lending myself to your efforts.\nGale: After so long being cared for by someone else, it feels good to have repaid the favour. Not directly to Tara, but to these poor tieflings. I'm sure she would approve.\nPlayer: She must be very smart, to have done all that.\nGale: 'Smart' does her a disservice. She's a fine wizard in her own right, though somewhat held back by her lack of opposable thumbs.\nGale: You remind me of her somewhat. Something in the way you roll your eyes when I speak...\nGale: I wish she were here for me to make a formal introduction, but I would never ask her to undertake such a journey. She is safer at home.\nGale: Besides, she was always telling me I needed to spread my wings, so to speak. Find mortal friends, instead of hanging onto Mystra's coattails. So that's what I'm doing. I hope.\nPlayer: You don't have any friends?\nGale: Sadly not. If I'm being entirely honest, my social circle is rather small. More of a dot. Or a pinhead.\nGale: I've got aquaintances, certainly. Plenty of colleagues. But friends? Those are precious indeed.\nGale: I hope, though we've only known each other for a short time, I might be able to count you among that number?\nPlayer: Friends with the mighty Gale of Waterdeep? I'd be honoured.\nGale: I'm glad. To know you enjoy my company is, well, it's rather wonderful actually. I'd be loathe to waste the time of someone who's become rather important to me.\nGale: I think you're rather wonderful. And that's not a word I waste on anyone unworthy of it.\nPlayer: The feeling's mutual - you're a wonderful friend. Though usually more... erudite.",

Its power is waning.\nVlaakith: There's little time. I will speak, and you will listen.\nVlaakith: We are githyanki. We move mountains, we snuff out stars, we shake the planes.\nVlaakith: The Heretic Prince would shatter us in an instant. The Great Dominion, shrunk to the head of a pin.\nNarrator: *Can this be true? Is the githyanki prince really a threat to his own people or simply a challenge to Vlaakith's rule?*\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: The hologram flickers once more.\nVlaakith: Return to the Astral Prism. Slay Orpheus the pretender.\nVlaakith: Serve me and I will ascend you. You will be no mere warrior, nor kith'rak. You will be Baht t'Vlaakith.\nVlaakith: Commander of Dragons. My only, my Chosen.\nVlaakith: A final chance. Kneel before me. Make your promise.\nNarrator: *Lae'zel's thoughts become yours. The sight of Orpheus looms over her mind; Voss' words echo within it. She means to forever turn her back on Vlaakith.*\nPlayer: Stand your ground. Don't fall for Vlaakith's lies.\nVlaakith: Shka'keth! You speak against the Eternal Queen?\nLae'zel: I gave you my faith, and you called me traitor. I gave you my life, and you ordered your knights to hunt me.\nLae'zel: I have witnessed too much, and you have given me too little. Finally, I can see.\nLae'zel: Orpheus will live, and I will hear his creed. This is my word.\nVlaakith: Your word is nothing. You are nothing.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: The Hologram flickers urgently\nVlaakith: The kith'raki will bring you. I will tear your flesh from your bones and devour your skull's marrow while you beg for death.\nVlaakith: I will consume you. I will unmake you!",

    "conversation": "[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) We see the Surgeon stand by a table upon which a wriggling human lies strapped down in an X position. Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon’s voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar.\nMalus Thorm: See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy.\nMalus Thorm: Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace.\nMalus Thorm: Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver.\nMalus Thorm: Come. Step forward. I can see the love of Shar darken your eyes. Be welcome.\nPlayer: What lesson are you teaching these sisters?\nMalus Thorm: The crux of our worship.\nMalus Thorm: Tell me, what is the guiding principle of the goddess?\nPlayer: Loss.\nMalus Thorm: I profess there is another more profound.\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly.\nMalus Thorm: It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nWyll: Hells. Only a monster would inflict misery and call it medicine.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being?\nMalus Thorm: If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: You are well on your way. But one white orb disfigures you still. Let us finish the cure.\nMalus Thorm: We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: Your subject is tainted. Shar's succour must only be granted to the willing.\nMalus Thorm: Hmmm. 'Only the willing may know the Lady's embrace.' You know her teachings well.\nMalus Thorm: And yet, these sisters must exercise their gifts, for the art of absence lies in its execution.\nMalus Thorm: How to proceed, I wonder.\nPlayer: Practice - that's how I got good with a blade. They should spar each other.\nPlayer: Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\n: True\nMalus Thorm: Yes... For are we not all in need of a cure?\nMalus Thorm: The scalpel does not discriminate. Let each and every one of you partake in its soothing journey.\nMalus Thorm: Absence, sisters. Acquaint yourselves.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) Screaming and slashing, the sisters brutally murder each other.\nMalus Thorm: It is a proud moment when one sees one's teachings so lovingly taken to heart.\nMalus Thorm: You are to be commended for their graduation - rewarded with the promised cure.\nMalus Thorm: Come, I will acquaint you with the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nPlayer: You do me an honour, but I am not worthy. Show me the way of Shar - I beg of you.\nPlayer: I would rather acquaint myself - if you show me how.\n: True\nMalus Thorm: Your diligence is exemplary. Very well: your own scalpel you will be.",

Though definitely unaccompanied by such revelry.\nGale: She preferred it when we were alone, curled up before a crackling hearth with some ancient, esoteric tome between us, ink glinting in the firelight...\nPlayer: I hope you aren't talking about Mystra again...\nGale: I speak of Tara, my tressym, assistant, my constant companion through all the ills and tribulations my hubris has thrust upon me.\nGale: She'd be proud to see me keeping such fine company - the saviour of those poor tieflings, no less. And I've given her precious little to be proud of recently.\nGale: She has a good heart, and she would recognise the same in your actions here. I'm sure she'd approve of me lending myself to your efforts.\nGale: After so long being cared for by someone else, it feels good to have repaid the favour. Not directly to Tara, but to these poor tieflings. I'm sure she would approve.\nPlayer: She must be very smart, to have done all that.\nGale: 'Smart' does her a disservice. She's a fine wizard in her own right, though somewhat held back by her lack of opposable thumbs.\nGale: You remind me of her somewhat. An expression you both share - when she gives in to her more feline qualities, a mouse trapped beneath her paw...\nGale: I wish she were here for me to make a formal introduction, but I would never ask her to undertake such a journey. She is safer at home.\nGale: Besides, she was always telling me I needed to spread my wings, so to speak. Find mortal friends, instead of hanging onto Mystra's coattails. So that's what I'm doing. I hope.\nPlayer: She sounds like a fine animal. One I'd be honoured to know.\nGale: She'll love you. So long as you don't rub her belly. She hates it when anyone does that.\nPlayer: She sounds great. But I was hoping I meant more to you than an animal companion...\nGale: I assure you, were you to meet Tara you would see the comparison for the flattery it is. But perhaps that's not a point worth labouring further.\nGale: Suffice it to say, I think rather a lot of you. And there aren't many on this plane who I'd give such high praise.\nPlayer: Being mentioned in the same breath as your pet isn't the compliment you think it is...\nGale: Then let me say it more plainly -\nGale: I think you're rather wonderful. And that's not a word I waste on anyone unworthy of it.\nPlayer: The feeling's mutual - you're a wonderful friend. Though usually more... erudite.",

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon’s voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar.\nMalus Thorm: See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy.\nMalus Thorm: Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace.\nMalus Thorm: Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver.\nMalus Thorm: Come. Step forward. I can see the love of Shar darken your eyes. Be welcome.\nPlayer: May Shar guide your blessing hands.\nMalus Thorm: And the rough vessels that are yours.\nMalus Thorm: Tell me, what is the guiding principle of the goddess?\nPlayer: Forgetfulness.\nMalus Thorm: I profess there is another more profound.\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly.\nMalus Thorm: It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nShadowheart: A stinging truth - but a truth nonetheless.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being?\nMalus Thorm: If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: But you: look how the succour of Shar eludes you. See how painfully present you remain...\nMalus Thorm: We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: The sisters aren't ready. They'll make me sick instead of curing me.\n: True\nMalus Thorm: Their incisions are, as yet, still streaked with imprecision - that much I must concede.\nMalus Thorm: How to steady their hands, I wonder.\nPlayer: Sparring is vital to progress. Have them practice on each other.\nPlayer: Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\n: True\nMalus Thorm: Yes... For are we not all in need of a cure?\nMalus Thorm: The scalpel does not discriminate. Let each and every one of you partake in its soothing journey.\nMalus Thorm: Absence, sisters. Acquaint yourselves.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) Screaming and slashing, the sisters brutally murder each other.\nMalus Thorm: It is a proud moment when one sees one's teachings so lovingly taken to heart.\nMalus Thorm: You are to be commended for their graduation - rewarded with the promised cure.\nMalus Thorm: Come, I will acquaint you with the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nPlayer: I am not worthy! Please, show me how a master works - I would be honoured.\nPlayer: I would rather acquaint myself - if you show me how.\n: True\nMalus Thorm: Your diligence is exemplary.

One should cherish all of nature's bounty... but goblin guts are quite far down the list.\nNodeContext: Hint of wry humour, Introducing himself after transforming from an owlbear and killing several goblins.\nHalsin: Not only do you speak with a bear, but you free it, too? A true friend of nature - or perhaps a lunatic.\nHalsin: Either way, I owe thanks. I am the druid Halsin.\nPlayer: Glad I could be of help.\nHalsin: I must admit, I didn't expect anyone would come to my aid. Who in their right mind would infiltrate a goblin infested temple. Unless...\nHalsin: ...Hrrm. That look in your eyes - I've seen it before. Are you feeling all right?\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Halsin raises a hand to your head, magically connecting with you (no contact). He gives an alarmed look - he knows what’s inside you\nHalsin: Oak Father preserve you, child... You're infected, aren't you? The mind flayers' spawn.\nHalsin: But... something's different. You're aware of the monster inside you. You don't bow to the Absolute, like the True Souls do...\nHalsin: How is this possible...?\nPlayer: I think this artefact has something to do with it.\nHalsin: Hmmm... that looks very alien. As alien as the mind flayers. They do not belong on this world.\nHalsin: It's no coincidence that you found me here, I'll wager? You're after a cure for this parasite.\nHalsin: I've been studying these parasites for a while now. Ever since I discovered these so-called True Souls are infected with them.\nHalsin: Someone is using very powerful magic to modify these tadpoles. They are using them to exert control over the infected.\nHalsin: I'm sorry to say, I can't undo that magic, which means I can't cure you. But that doesn't mean I can't help.\nHalsin: I didn't find what I came here for - a way to remove the tadpoles - but I found the next best thing. I found out where they come from.\nHalsin: That must be where these enchantments are placed on them, and it's where you'll find your cure.\nPlayer: You learned all this from your studies?\nHalsin: Indeed. After we dealt with the drow that ambushed us, Nettie and I were able to inspect the corpse - and the creature that slithered out of it.\nHalsin: I had no idea anyone beyond their ranks was infected. You have my sincere sympathies.\nPlayer: This magic you mentioned - it isn't normal for these parasites?\nPlayer: What should I do?\nHalsin: I overheard that the cultists are sending all of their captives to Moonrise Towers.\nHalsin: Innocents go in, True Souls come out. Given that all of these True Souls are infected, it has to be the source of this magic.\nHalsin: If you want to find a cure, you must head there and discover how the tadpoles are being manipulated.\nPlayer: Altered parasites? A cure at Moonrise Towers, maybe? Sounds like guesswork at best.\nHalsin: I'm as certain as I can be. If you have a better alternative, I won't stop you.\nHalsin: I can't stop you, in fact. Which brings me to my next problem...\nHalsin: I've no right to ask more of you... but if you could help me, I'd be free to join your journey to Moonrise.\nHalsin: I cannot allow these butchers to threaten my grove. The natural order must be protected.\nPlayer: Look around you - there's no order anymore. Only chaos.\nHalsin: Chaos is welcome, in doses; it helps keep balance. But this is too much - this is unnatural.\nHalsin: Help me kill the leaders of this horde, save my grove. Then I will help you.\n\nHalsin: Three deaths could win us peace: the drow Minthara, the hobgoblin Dror Ragzlin, and that perversion of a priestess, Gut.\nHalsin: They are the ones holding these parasites together. Remove them and nature will cure itself.\nPlayer: I'll deal with this. You get to safety.\nHalsin: There is no safety. Not while this rot festers. Once it is cut out - once the grove is secure - then I shall leave.\nPlayer: Follow me, then. Your bear form may prove useful.\nHalsin: Be warned - my presence could make things more difficult... I can only restrain my bear form so much. I won't be able to help but attack goblins.\nHalsin: If I join you, we'll likely have to slaughter this entire place. You may want to use discretion when approaching the goblin leaders.\nPlayer: Come with me.\nHalsin: So be it. May Silvanus lend us nature's fury.",

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon’s voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar.\nMalus Thorm: See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy.\nMalus Thorm: Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace.\nMalus Thorm: Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver.\nMalus Thorm: Come. Step forward. I can see the love of Shar darken your eyes. Be welcome.\nPlayer: What lesson are you teaching these sisters?\nMalus Thorm: The crux of our worship.\nMalus Thorm: Tell me, what is the guiding principle of the goddess?\nPlayer: Darkness.\nMalus Thorm: I profess there is another more profound.\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly.\nMalus Thorm: It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nLae'zel: Only a beast of a man toys with his victim. Entertaining, if not efficient.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being?\nMalus Thorm: If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: But you: look how the succour of Shar eludes you. See how painfully present you remain...\nMalus Thorm: We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: Their blades are uneven. Efficient surgery will require further training.\nMalus Thorm: Their incisions are, as yet, still streaked with imprecision - that much I must concede.\nMalus Thorm: How to steady their hands, I wonder.\nPlayer: Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\n: True\nMalus Thorm: Yes... For are we not all in need of a cure?\nMalus Thorm: The scalpel does not discriminate. Let each and every one of you partake in its soothing journey.\nMalus Thorm: Absence, sisters. Acquaint yourselves.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) Screaming and slashing, the sisters brutally murder each other.\nMalus Thorm: It is a proud moment when one sees one's teachings so lovingly taken to heart.\nMalus Thorm: You are to be commended for their graduation - rewarded with the promised cure.\nMalus Thorm: Come, I will acquaint you with the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nPlayer: I would rather acquaint myself - if you show me how.\n: True\nMalus Thorm: Your diligence is exemplary.

Don't you dare consider it.\nPlayer: What are you going to do with it?\nHavkelaag: Study it, of course. Your kind have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months.\nHavkelaag: Most on this plane believe you to be innately cruel, violent beings. Evil, if you will.\nHavkelaag: As citizens of the Underdark, we face similar stigmas. Totally unfounded, of course - our natures are as unfixed as any who walk the surface.\nHavkelaag: I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: What does this 'intellectually stimulating' upbringing look like?\nHavkelaag: In the literal sense, I will need to induce the egg to hatch via the application of certain currents to the creature inside.\nHavkelaag: Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach:\nHavkelaag: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue.\nHavkelaag: Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: So you, too, follow the teachings of Bahamut. Why him?\nHavkelaag: In my years of study, they're the closest I've found to moral perfection. Only under such rigorous 'goodness' will the subject stand a chance of being cured.\nHavkelaag: My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: And what if your experiment fails?\nHavkelaag: If the child remains evil after the experiment is concluded, it will be destroyed. Such is the fate of all used specimens.\nHavkelaag: Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg?

Turning his attention to the player to deliver a threat.\nPlayer: I won't interfere. I just want to pass by.\nFezzerk: Heh, funny. That's what our birdie wanted.\nNodeContext: Mocking.\nBarcus Wroot: ...Release me this instant, you beasts!\nNodeContext: Panicked, angry. Issuing an ultimatum even though he has no means of following through on it.\nFezzerk: 'Less you wanna join him up there, you'd best pay the toll.\nNodeContext: Fezzerk mockingly refers to the deep gnome's predicament as he threatens the player. 'Passing by' refers to rotating on a windmill rather than safe passage through the area, in his book.\nFezzerk: Cough it up! ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nNodeContext: Fezzerk declares his price. (A ridiculously high sum - questionable whether he truly knows how absurd a demand this is)\nNarrator: *The mark glows, but you feel nothing in response. Your illithid power is beyond reach until you rest.*\nPlayer: This will lead only to pain, not fulfilment.\nFezzerk: Eh? I ain't after fulfilment! I'm after the fillin' of my pockets.

I reckon we could do better than this runt, aye...\nNarrator: *The goblin's nostrils flare, as if trying to judge you through smell alone...*\nNodeContext: Narration\nFezzerk: We're leaving.\nGoblin Devout: What about the gnome?

I was hoping to speak to you - I confess, my thoughts have been somewhat scattered since my audience with Mystra.\nGale: The Karsite Weave could offer more than just power - it could bestow divinity. If I only trust myself to wield it.\nGale: The power to change the world - it may be within our reach. You must have an opinion, surely.\nPlayer: I don't know what to say. How can I respond to something so... immense? It's beyond comprehension.\nGale: Then the fault lies with me, and my inadequate words. Please, allow me to show you instead. Just close your eyes a moment.\nGale: Words alone are not enough. Permit me to show you. Please, close your eyes a moment.\nPlayer: Close your eyes.\nGale: Astra navigabimus.\nNodeContext: Latin spellcasting - ass-tra navi-gah-mus ('we sail the stars')\nGale: Few mortals ever glimpse what you're about to see. But don't be alarmed - I'm here with you. Now... open your eyes.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Fade up from black as the player opens their eyes to a dazzling spectacle. They and Gale are now sitting in a small boat that shimmers with iridescent light. Unpiloted, it silently meanders through a majestic, infinite starfield.\nGale: The Outer Planes. This is where gods dwell. Where they observe us from afar. Where they make play-things of us.\nGale: They would keep all of this from us - the power, the possibilities. They only want us to serve them, pray to them... and ultimately, die for them.\nGale: But what if we didn't need them? What if we wielded their power instead, and helped ourselves in all the ways they refuse to. I could make that happen. I could make this illusion a reality, with you by my side.\nPlayer: You're still determined to do this, after all that was said?\nGale: How could I not crave this? But I don't want it for myself, alone - I want you at my side, willing and wholehearted.\nGale: The tadpoles, the orb - these threats to our existence - the gods could aid us if they wished, but instead they cower behind Ao. So let us act ourselves.\nNodeContext: Ao = AY-oh (an overlord deity that most gods answer to)\nGale: With the power of the crown, any foe would be rendered impotent. Any obstacle would be dwarfed by our might.\nGale: I used to believe Mystra's forgiveness was worth dying for. But I was wrong. You showed me just how much I have to live for.\nGale: With you, I forget my goddess. I love you.\nGale: Tell me you feel the same way. Tell me you want what I want. Please.\nPlayer: This sounds dangerous.\nGale: No doubt it will be - abominably so. As is just about everything we do. But I know we're up to the task. What do you say...?\nGale: You mean... you want the same as I do?\nNodeContext: Hope rising again\nPlayer: Yes. I want you to seize the crown, and make us a new world.\nGale: Then it will be so. With you and I together, there's not a force in existence that can stop us.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: The player and Gale lean in to kiss while seated facing each other.\nGale: You see me as I am, and do not find me wanting. With these stars as my witness, I swear - you will always be enough for me.",

Nothing like a brush with destruction to make one appreciate the majesty of the celestial canvas.\nGale: It's a view I would once have shared with my companion.

She's a tressym. And given your confusion, I'm guessing you've never met one. They're brilliant creatures - fine company for any self-respecting wizard.\nGale: I speak of Tara, my tressym, assistant, my constant companion through all the ills and tribulations my hubris has thrust upon me.\nGale: She'd be most impressed by our efforts saving these tieflings. Proud, even. And I've given her little to be proud of recently.\nGale: After I was afflicted with my condition, I locked myself in my tower for an entire year. I was inconsolable, wallowing in my self-inflicted tragedy.\nGale: I'd given up on myself, but Tara never did. It was her encouragement, her research that led me to my treatment. Once we knew that magically-infused items were the key, she went out to find them for me. She saved my life.\nGale: After so long being cared for by someone else, it feels good to have repaid the favour. Not directly to Tara, but to these poor tieflings. I'm sure she would approve.\nPlayer: She must be very smart, to have done all that.\nGale: 'Smart' does her a disservice. She's a fine wizard in her own right, though somewhat held back by her lack of opposable thumbs.\nGale: You remind me of her somewhat. You share her pragmatic streak.\nGale: I wish she were here for me to make a formal introduction, but I would never ask her to undertake such a journey. She is safer at home.\nGale: Besides, she was always telling me I needed to spread my wings, so to speak. Find mortal friends, instead of hanging onto Mystra's coattails. So that's what I'm doing. I hope.\nPlayer: Bad luck on that front - I'm actually a nymph in disguise...\nGale: Very funny. But as we all know, nymphs are sticklers when it comes to their bathing routines. You, my friend, haven't been near a fresh spring in a tenday or more.\nGale: Not that I don't appreciate your musk. I actually rather like it...\nGale: Well, this seems as good a time as any for me to stop babbling on.\nGale: I think you're rather wonderful. And that's not a word I waste on anyone unworthy of it.\nPlayer: Actually, I was thinking we'd be wonderful together...\nGale: Wait. Are you saying...\nGale: I see. Then perhaps we see each other in the same light after all. A resplendent one, flush with warmth and anticipation, but one which I must shy away from, for now.",

We'd be free of doctrine and dogma, confined only by the limits of our imaginations.\nGale: I promise you - the gods will never grant us such a blessing, no matter how much we worship and adore them.\nPlayer: You dismiss the entire pantheon so easily. Not all gods are selfish.\nGale: Some gods may delude themselves into believing they care about their worshippers, but when it comes down to it - we're all expendable.

Though I never felt alone with a book in my hand. Or with her for company.\nGale: I speak of Tara, my tressym, assistant, my constant companion through all the ills and tribulations my hubris has thrust upon me.\nGale: She'd be most impressed by our efforts saving these tieflings. Proud, even. And I've given her little to be proud of recently.\nGale: After I was afflicted with my condition, I locked myself in my tower for an entire year.

You share her fierceness, and her passion.\nGale: I wish she were here for me to make a formal introduction, but I would never ask her to undertake such a journey. She is safer at home.\nGale: Besides, she was always telling me I needed to spread my wings, so to speak. Find mortal friends, instead of hanging onto Mystra's coattails. So that's what I'm doing. I hope.\nPlayer: Bad luck on that front - I'm actually a nymph in disguise...\nGale: Very funny. But as we all know, nymphs are sticklers when it comes to their bathing routines. You, my friend, haven't been near a fresh spring in a tenday or more.\nGale: Not that I don't appreciate your musk.

His designs for godhood.\nPlayer: How did such a powerful object end up in the hands of the Absolute?\nGale: I haven't the foggiest. No doubt through some nefarious means - the crown's existence had been consigned to legend centuries ago.\nGale: The book states that the Crown and Netherstones were originally one construct, seemingly sundered at the moment of Karsus' downfall.\nGale: If we can collect the crown's setting, and the three Netherstones, and with the correct invocation of certain spells and gestures detailed in these notes... I think I could reforge it.\nPlayer: To what end?\nGale: To every end you can imagine, and a thousand more beyond.\nGale: Just think of it... the power of the gods in mortal hands at last. We'd be free of doctrine and dogma, confined only by the limits of our imaginations.\nGale: I promise you - the gods will never grant us such a blessing, no matter how much we worship and adore them.\nPlayer: Mortals are far better guardians of their fates than the gods.

She's done nothing to help us.\nGale: Mystra wanted the brain obliterated because of this crown. She fears a world in which such power is beyond her control - ready to be claimed by Karsus' successor.\nPlayer: And you believe yourself to be that successor?\nGale: Not until this moment, but I can't help beginning to see such a destiny unfold before me.\nGale: Powerful as he was, Karsus lacked some advantages I can lay claim to.\nGale: I know Mystra - intimately. And I carry a fragment of the Weave itself within my body. Karsus achieved many things, but he never managed that.\nGale: A long road lies ahead before the Crown comes into our possession. All I ask for now is that you not dismiss this possibility out of hand. Please - at least think on it.\nPlayer: The pursuit of knowledge and power is in our nature.

    "conversation": "Gale: I owe you an apology. Things became quite heated between us before, after I learned of the Crown of Karsus. I allowed myself to get carried away, and failed to properly explain myself.\nPlayer: Forget it.\nGale: I can't. Your opinion matters greatly to me. Give me a chance - I think I can help you understand.\nGale: Words alone are not enough. Permit me to show you. Please, close your eyes a moment.\nPlayer: Close your eyes.\nGale: Astra navigabimus.\nNodeContext: Latin spellcasting - ass-tra navi-gah-mus ('we sail the stars')\nGale: Few mortals ever glimpse what you're about to see. But don't be alarmed - I'm here with you. Now... open your eyes.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Fade up from black as the player opens their eyes to a dazzling spectacle. They and Gale are now sitting in a small boat that shimmers with iridescent light. Unpiloted, it silently meanders through a majestic, infinite starfield.\nGale: The Outer Planes. This is where gods dwell. Where they observe us from afar. Where they make play-things of us.\nGale: They would keep all of this from us - the power, the possibilities. They only want us to serve them, pray to them... and ultimately, die for them.\nGale: But what if we didn't need them? What if we wielded their power instead, and helped ourselves in all the ways they refuse to. I could make that happen. I could make this illusion a reality, with you by my side.\nPlayer: You know how I feel. I've already voiced my support.\nGale: Yes, you have. But I want more than your support. I want your heart.\nGale: The tadpoles, the orb - these threats to our existence - the gods could aid us if they wished, but instead they cower behind Ao. So let us act ourselves.\nNodeContext: Ao = AY-oh (an overlord deity that most gods answer to)\nGale: With the power of the crown, any foe would be rendered impotent. Any obstacle would be dwarfed by our might.\nGale: I used to believe Mystra's forgiveness was worth dying for. But I was wrong. You showed me just how much I have to live for.\nGale: With you, I forget my goddess. I love you.\nGale: Tell me you feel the same way. Tell me you want what I want. Please.\nPlayer: This is wrong, Gale. That power will corrupt you, even if you can seize it.\nGale: It won't, I swear to you. It's merely a tool - a means to an end.\nGale: You told me once to choose you, the one who loved me. That's what this is all about. Do you doubt me?\nPlayer: I don't doubt your motivations, but do this, and you will match Karsus' folly with your own.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Gale's shoulders sag. The starfield around seems to dim. Distant points of light vanish into the infinite dark.\nGale: What more is there to be said?\nPlayer: Plenty, in time. This doesn't have to be the end for us - just forget the crown.\nGale: But I could be so much more to you.\nNodeContext: crestfallen\nPlayer: Say nothing. Answer him with a kiss instead.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: The player and Gale lean in to kiss while seated facing each other.\nGale: You put the stars to shame. Let's sit here another while - I want to drink you in.",

Though definitely unaccompanied by such revelry.\nGale: She preferred it when we were alone, curled up before a crackling hearth with some ancient, esoteric tome between us, ink glinting in the firelight...\nPlayer: I hope you aren't talking about Mystra again...\nGale: I speak of Tara, my tressym, assistant, my constant companion through all the ills and tribulations my hubris has thrust upon me.\nGale: She'd be most impressed by our efforts saving these tieflings. Proud, even. And I've given her little to be proud of recently.\nGale: After I was afflicted with my condition, I locked myself in my tower for an entire year. I was inconsolable, wallowing in my self-inflicted tragedy.\nGale: I'd given up on myself, but Tara never did. It was her encouragement, her research that led me to my treatment. Once we knew that magically-infused items were the key, she went out to find them for me. She saved my life.\nGale: After so long being cared for by someone else, it feels good to have repaid the favour. Not directly to Tara, but to these poor tieflings. I'm sure she would approve.\nPlayer: What is Tara like?\nGale: 'Smart' does her a disservice. She's a fine wizard in her own right, though somewhat held back by her lack of opposable thumbs.\nGale: You remind me of her somewhat. There's a steeliness to you, an unwavering tenacity even in the face of, to be frank, quite dire odds.\nGale: I wish she were here for me to make a formal introduction, but I would never ask her to undertake such a journey. She is safer at home.\nGale: Besides, she was always telling me I needed to spread my wings, so to speak. Find mortal friends, instead of hanging onto Mystra's coattails. So that's what I'm doing. I hope.\nPlayer: So I remind you of your pet? How romantic...\nGale: I assure you, were you to meet Tara you would see the comparison for the flattery it is. But perhaps that's not a point worth labouring further.\nGale: Suffice it to say, I think rather a lot of you. And there aren't many on this plane who I'd give such high praise.\nPlayer: I'm flattered. Is your good opinion so hard to come by?\nGale: One doesn't become the most powerful archmage in Waterdeep and lover to the goddess of magic herself by having low standards.\nGale: I assure you, when I tell someone they're wonderful - I mean it. And you are wonderful.\nGale: I think you're rather wonderful. And that's not a word I waste on anyone unworthy of it.\nPlayer: Don't stop now. What else do you like about me?\nGale: Were I to recite that list, I fear we'd still be here at dusk tomorrow. Many things, I assure you, but a conversation better saved for another time.",

I was hoping to speak to you - I confess, my thoughts have been somewhat scattered since my audience with Mystra.\nGale: The Karsite Weave could offer more than just power - it could bestow divinity. If I only trust myself to wield it.\nGale: The power to change the world - it may be within our reach. You must have an opinion, surely.\nPlayer: So much power will only prove dangerous. You should forget it.\nGale: But I cannot. You would  not be able to either, if you knew what I knew. Please, allow me to show you. Just close your eyes a moment.\nGale: Words alone are not enough. Permit me to show you. Please, close your eyes a moment.\nPlayer: Close your eyes.\nGale: Astra navigabimus.\nNodeContext: Latin spellcasting - ass-tra navi-gah-mus ('we sail the stars')\nGale: Few mortals ever glimpse what you're about to see. But don't be alarmed - I'm here with you. Now... open your eyes.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Fade up from black as the player opens their eyes to a dazzling spectacle. They and Gale are now sitting in a small boat that shimmers with iridescent light. Unpiloted, it silently meanders through a majestic, infinite starfield.\nGale: The Outer Planes. This is where gods dwell. Where they observe us from afar. Where they make play-things of us.\nGale: They would keep all of this from us - the power, the possibilities. They only want us to serve them, pray to them... and ultimately, die for them.\nGale: But what if we didn't need them? What if we wielded their power instead, and helped ourselves in all the ways they refuse to. I could make that happen. I could make this illusion a reality, with you by my side.\nPlayer: Are you saying you want to ascend? Claim godhood?\nGale: No, not like that. I don't want to join them, I want to better them. A god's powers, paired with a mortal conscience, a mortal heart.\nGale: The tadpoles, the orb - these threats to our existence - the gods could aid us if they wished, but instead they cower behind Ao. So let us act ourselves.\nNodeContext: Ao = AY-oh (an overlord deity that most gods answer to)\nGale: With the power of the crown, any foe would be rendered impotent. Any obstacle would be dwarfed by our might.\nGale: I used to believe Mystra's forgiveness was worth dying for. But I was wrong. You showed me just how much I have to live for.\nGale: With you, I forget my goddess. I love you.\nGale: Tell me you feel the same way. Tell me you want what I want. Please.\nPlayer: This sounds dangerous.\nGale: No doubt it will be - abominably so. As is just about everything we do. But I know we're up to the task. What do you say...?\nGale: You mean... you want the same as I do?\nNodeContext: Hope rising again\nPlayer: Yes. I want you to seize the crown, and make us a new world.\nGale: I've never wanted to kiss you more than I do now.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Player and Gale are seated facing each other but do not lean in to kiss.\nGale: You put the stars to shame. Let's sit here another while - I want to drink you in.",

She's a tressym. And given your confusion, I'm guessing you've never met one. They're brilliant creatures - fine company for any self-respecting wizard.\nGale: I speak of Tara, my tressym, assistant, my constant companion through all the ills and tribulations my hubris has thrust upon me.\nGale: She'd be most impressed by our efforts saving these tieflings. Proud, even. And I've given her little to be proud of recently.\nGale: After I was afflicted with my condition, I locked myself in my tower for an entire year.

And sharp teeth.\nGale: I wish she were here for me to make a formal introduction, but I would never ask her to undertake such a journey.

She's a fine wizard in her own right, though somewhat held back by her lack of opposable thumbs.\nGale: You remind me of her somewhat. An expression you both share - when she gives in to her more feline qualities, a mouse trapped beneath her paw...\nGale: I wish she were here for me to make a formal introduction, but I would never ask her to undertake such a journey. She is safer at home.\nGale: Besides, she was always telling me I needed to spread my wings, so to speak. Find mortal friends, instead of hanging onto Mystra's coattails. So that's what I'm doing. I hope.\nPlayer: So I remind you of your pet? How romantic...\nGale: I assure you, were you to meet Tara you would see the comparison for the flattery it is. But perhaps that's not a point worth labouring further.\nGale: Suffice it to say, I think rather a lot of you. And there aren't many on this plane who I'd give such high praise.\nPlayer: Being mentioned in the same breath as your pet isn't the compliment you think it is...\nGale: Then let me say it more plainly -\nGale: I think you're rather wonderful. And that's not a word I waste on anyone unworthy of it.\nPlayer: Actually, I was thinking we'd be wonderful together...\nGale: Wait. Are you saying...\nGale: You know what, I think I've clearly had far too much wine. And you've had nowhere near enough. I think this is a conversation best held back on - for now.",

Those are precious indeed.\nGale: I hope, though we've only known each other for a short time, I might be able to count you among that number?\nPlayer: Friends with the mighty Gale of Waterdeep?

I'm sure she'd approve of me lending myself to your efforts.\nGale: After so long being cared for by someone else, it feels good to have repaid the favour. Not directly to Tara, but to these poor tieflings. I'm sure she would approve.\nPlayer: What is Tara like?\nGale: 'Smart' does her a disservice. She's a fine wizard in her own right, though somewhat held back by her lack of opposable thumbs.\nGale: You remind me of her somewhat. You share her fierceness, and her passion.\nGale: I wish she were here for me to make a formal introduction, but I would never ask her to undertake such a journey. She is safer at home.\nGale: Besides, she was always telling me I needed to spread my wings, so to speak. Find mortal friends, instead of hanging onto Mystra's coattails. So that's what I'm doing. I hope.\nPlayer: She sounds like a fine animal. One I'd be honoured to know.\nGale: She'll love you. So long as you don't rub her belly. She hates it when anyone does that.\nPlayer: She sounds great. But I was hoping I meant more to you than an animal companion...\nGale: I assure you, were you to meet Tara you would see the comparison for the flattery it is. But perhaps that's not a point worth labouring further.\nGale: Suffice it to say, I think rather a lot of you. And there aren't many on this plane who I'd give such high praise.\nPlayer: Being mentioned in the same breath as your pet isn't the compliment you think it is...\nGale: Then let me say it more plainly -\nGale: I think you're rather wonderful. And that's not a word I waste on anyone unworthy of it.\nPlayer: Don't stop now. What else do you like about me?\nGale: Were I to recite that list, I fear we'd still be here at dusk tomorrow. Many things, I assure you, but a conversation better saved for another time.",

The art of conversation. The art of taste, time honoured and newly acquired.\nGale: The art of the body. The exploration and acceptance of the self and the other. The art of the night itself.\nGale: I say we take a page from their book.\nPlayer: Leave it to you to woo someone with a book.\nGale: Forget the book then.

Proud, even. And I've given her little to be proud of recently.\nGale: After I was afflicted with my condition, I locked myself in my tower for an entire year. I was inconsolable, wallowing in my self-inflicted tragedy.\nGale: I'd given up on myself, but Tara never did. It was her encouragement, her research that led me to my treatment. Once we knew that magically-infused items were the key, she went out to find them for me. She saved my life.\nGale: After so long being cared for by someone else, it feels good to have repaid the favour. Not directly to Tara, but to these poor tieflings. I'm sure she would approve.\nPlayer: She must be very smart, to have done all that.\nGale: 'Smart' does her a disservice. She's a fine wizard in her own right, though somewhat held back by her lack of opposable thumbs.\nGale: You remind me of her somewhat. An expression you both share - when she gives in to her more feline qualities, a mouse trapped beneath her paw...\nGale: I wish she were here for me to make a formal introduction, but I would never ask her to undertake such a journey. She is safer at home.\nGale: Besides, she was always telling me I needed to spread my wings, so to speak. Find mortal friends, instead of hanging onto Mystra's coattails. So that's what I'm doing. I hope.\nPlayer: What if she doesn't like me?\nGale: She'll love you. So long as you don't rub her belly. She hates it when anyone does that.\nPlayer: She sounds great. But I was hoping I meant more to you than an animal companion...\nGale: I assure you, were you to meet Tara you would see the comparison for the flattery it is. But perhaps that's not a point worth labouring further.\nGale: Suffice it to say, I think rather a lot of you. And there aren't many on this plane who I'd give such high praise.\nPlayer: Being mentioned in the same breath as your pet isn't the compliment you think it is...\nGale: Then let me say it more plainly -\nGale: I think you're rather wonderful. And that's not a word I waste on anyone unworthy of it.\nPlayer: Actually, I was thinking we'd be wonderful together...\nGale: Wait. Are you saying...\nGale: You know what, I think I've clearly had far too much wine. And you've had nowhere near enough. I think this is a conversation best held back on - for now.",

Please, close your eyes a moment.\nPlayer: Close your eyes.\nGale: Astra navigabimus.\nNodeContext: Latin spellcasting - ass-tra navi-gah-mus ('we sail the stars')\nGale: Few mortals ever glimpse what you're about to see. But don't be alarmed - I'm here with you. Now... open your eyes.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Fade up from black as the player opens their eyes to a dazzling spectacle. They and Gale are now sitting in a small boat that shimmers with iridescent light. Unpiloted, it silently meanders through a majestic, infinite starfield.\nGale: The Outer Planes. This is where gods dwell. Where they observe us from afar. Where they make play-things of us.\nGale: They would keep all of this from us - the power, the possibilities. They only want us to serve them, pray to them... and ultimately, die for them.\nGale: But what if we didn't need them? What if we wielded their power instead, and helped ourselves in all the ways they refuse to. I could make that happen. I could make this illusion a reality, with you by my side.\nPlayer: I don't need the stars, Gale. I have you.\nGale: Then have me - but have the best possible version of me.\nGale: The tadpoles, the orb - these threats to our existence - the gods could aid us if they wished, but instead they cower behind Ao. So let us act ourselves.\nNodeContext: Ao = AY-oh (an overlord deity that most gods answer to)\nGale: With the power of the crown, any foe would be rendered impotent. Any obstacle would be dwarfed by our might.\nGale: I used to believe Mystra's forgiveness was worth dying for. But I was wrong. You showed me just how much I have to live for.\nGale: With you, I forget my goddess. I love you.\nGale: Tell me you feel the same way. Tell me you want what I want. Please.\nPlayer: I feel the same. Whatever you need of me, consider it done.\nGale: Right now, I need nothing more than a kiss. Then we'll face what is to come, together. And claim the crown when the time comes.\nPlayer: Wait. Perhaps I'm being too hasty... and perhaps you're overreaching.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Gale's shoulders sag. The starfield around seems to dim. Distant points of light vanish into the infinite dark.\nGale: What more is there to be said?\nPlayer: Plenty, in time. This doesn't have to be the end for us - just forget the crown.\nGale: But I could be so much more to you.\nNodeContext: crestfallen\nPlayer: Say nothing. Answer him with a kiss instead.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: The player and Gale lean in to kiss while seated facing each other.\nGale: You put the stars to shame. Let's sit here another while - I want to drink you in.",
