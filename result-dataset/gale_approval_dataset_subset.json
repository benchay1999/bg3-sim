    "conversation": "Gale: Why don't we take a little break? Allow ourselves a few moments of rest. Gives me a chance to talk to you about something, well, rather important.\nPlayer: 'Rather important' no less? All right, go ahead.\nGale: We've been on the road together for a while now, haven't we? Survived some perils, overcame some obstacles.\nGale: Ever since you were kind enough to free me from that stone, I've seen you demonstrate remarkable guile and courage.\nGale: The way you defused the tension between Zevlor and Aradin.\nGale: The way you stood in front of a crossbow to prevent a murder.\nGale: The way you got Kagha to release the girl.\nGale: The way you handled Nettie when she poisoned you.\nGale: The way you got that boy out of a harpy's clutches.\nGale: The way you followed the protocol and brought me back to life.\nGale: These deeds attest to a strong and noble character. They attest to prime leadership qualities as well.\nGale: In short: I've grown to trust you.\nPlayer: Enough with the flattery. Where is this going?\nGale: I was being quite sincere, I assure you.\nGale: The reason I make a point of saying this is that I've grown confident enough to tell you something I've yet to tell another living soul. Except for my cat.\nGale: You see, I have this... condition. Very different from the parasite we share, but just as deadly.\nPlayer: Is it contagious?\nGale: No, no - nothing like that. Though if I fail to treat it then the consequences would not be contained to me alone.\nGale: What it comes down to is this: every so often I need to get my hands on a powerful magical item and absorb the Weave inside.\nPlayer: Your illness causes you to consume raw magic? I'm going to need the details...\nGale: I can say no more on the matter - not now anyway.\nGale: Just trust me when I say it's all of vital importance.\nGale: Catastrophe.\nGale: It's been days since I last consumed an artefact - since before we were abducted. It is time.\nGale: And by that I mean it's imperative that I find and consume strands of Weave at the earliest possible juncture.\nGale: That is why I turn to you. I need you to help me find magic items to consume. It is vital. Dare I say it, critical.\nPlayer: Where do you suggest we find the artefacts you need?\nGale: As luck would have it, Faer√ªn is full of them, though I do feel obliged to point out that items of power tend to be in the hands of the powerful.\nGale: There will be danger involved - or great cost.\nPlayer: Honestly, that sounds terrible. I see no upside to this for me.\nGale: Then I suggest you look closer.\nGale: Having a wizard like me around is quite the boon when facing the perils that stalk these lands. It will be far harder for me to assist you if I can barely stand upright.\nGale: Please - trust me. Your help could be the difference between life and death.\nPlayer: My help was already the difference between life and death where you're concerned. You owe me an explanation.\nGale: I'm afraid it doesn't quite work like that - though of course I'm immensely grateful for any assistance you provide in times of mortal peril. But I must ask more trust of you still.\nGale: Please reconsider.\nPlayer: You aren't going to drop this, are you?\nGale: No.\nPlayer: Neither am I. We'll have to see who gives up first.\nGale: Very well. You're clearly in no mood to be receptive to my request at present.",

The moment feels intimate.*\nPlayer: Hold on to the moment. It's a good night for intimacy.\nNarrator: *You realise the Weave is making you one. You have but to imagine your desire, and Gale will know it.*\nPlayer: Picture kicking him in the gut.",

Wonderful.\nGale: I am what I am - I never lied to you, I've merely been economical with the truth.\nGale: The specifics are rather personal, but suffice it to say that it is a malady I have learned to live with - though not without some effort.\nGale: What it comes down to is this: every so often I need to get my hands on a powerful magical item and absorb the Weave inside.\nPlayer: Wouldn't that ruin the item?\nGale: Trust me when I say - the loss of the occasional wizard's staff or tome of enchantment is a bargain given the cost of allowing me to deteriorate.\nGale: Catastrophe.\nGale: It's been days since I last consumed an artefact - since before we were abducted.

If the Moonmaiden didn't strike me dead for blessing you, she must rather approve of this little alliance.\nIsobel: This will block the lesser effects of the shadow curse, allowing you to traverse the darkness outside... should Shar's own protection falter, that is.\nIsobel: Curious. Surely the Nightsinger could have shielded all her followers, and made this place her domain long ago... yet she only acts now, and aids you alone. I wonder why.\nPlayer: The Dark Lady's works aren't for me to question.\nIsobel: Mustn't question the great shadow mother, must we?\nIsobel: I'll stop needling you, though.

Her hands are in a prayer position and she's chanting softly as the moonlight dances around her. She exhales, then inhales and breaths in tendrils of shadow, absorbing them. She swallows, then begins hacking coughing. The moonlight dissipates. She quickly goes from seeming like a divine spirit to a normal young woman.\nIsobel: I didn't realise I had an audience.\nFist Marcus: Isobel. This is -\nIsobel: A Sharran.\nNarrator: *Isobel. The same name as Ketheric Thorm's daughter - the one whose sarcophagus you found empty in the family mausoleum.*\nPlayer: Push your Urges down.\nPlayer: You can tell my allegiance from a look?\nIsobel: It's an aura. Or a lack of one, really.\nIsobel: Frankly, I'm surprised you're willing to help us. Your kind aren't known for their decency - particularly when a Sharran curse is our greatest obstacle.\nIsobel: But if you are who I think you are, I'd be a fool to reject your help. The True Soul with... well, a soul. Imagine.\nPlayer: I won't be spoken to like that by a Sel√ªnite.\nIsobel: We've both got a bitter pill to swallow. When this is all over, we can spit it back out.\nIsobel: You'll be needing the protection spell, I presume?\nIsobel: Oh - aren't you looking for a protection spell?\nPlayer: I need nothing from a Sel√ªnite.\nIsobel: But any others who travel with you may not agree. Do it for them at least - you will need all the help you can get out there.\nPlayer: Silently petition Lady Shar for guidance.\nNarrator: *She offers you nothing.*\nIsobel: Well! If the Moonmaiden didn't strike me dead for blessing you, she must rather approve of this little alliance.\nIsobel: This will block the lesser effects of the shadow curse, allowing you to traverse the darkness outside... should Shar's own protection falter, that is.\nIsobel: Curious. Surely the Nightsinger could have shielded all her followers, and made this place her domain long ago... yet she only acts now, and aids you alone. I wonder why.\nPlayer: That's none of your concern.\nIsobel: I suppose you're right.\nIsobel: I'll stop needling you, though. You have more important things to do, after all.\nPlayer: I've already been to Moonrise, but I have more work to do indeed.\nIsobel: I imagine so, if Jaheira hasn't gone tearing off into the night.\nPlayer: You're coming with me, cleric.",

Her hands are in a prayer position and she's chanting softly as the moonlight dances around her. She exhales, then inhales and breaths in tendrils of shadow, absorbing them. She swallows, then begins hacking coughing. The moonlight dissipates. She quickly goes from seeming like a divine spirit to a normal young woman.\nIsobel: I didn't realise I had an audience.\nFist Marcus: Isobel. This is -\nIsobel: A Sharran.\nNarrator: *Isobel. The same name as Ketheric Thorm's daughter - the one whose sarcophagus you found empty in the family mausoleum.*\nPlayer: Push your Urges down.\nPlayer: You can tell my allegiance from a look?\nIsobel: It's an aura. Or a lack of one, really.\nIsobel: Frankly, I'm surprised you're willing to help us. Your kind aren't known for their decency - particularly when a Sharran curse is our greatest obstacle.\nIsobel: But if you are who I think you are, I'd be a fool to reject your help. The True Soul with... well, a soul. Imagine.\nPlayer: You seem to have a lot to say about my allegiance. Can we focus on the task at hand?\nIsobel: I suppose that would be wise. We have a common enemy, after all: Ketheric Thorm.\nIsobel: You'll be needing the protection spell, I presume?\nIsobel: Oh - aren't you looking for a protection spell?\nPlayer: Nod. Better to humour her than make an enemy of all in this place. Lady Shar will understand.\nIsobel: Refreshingly pragmatic of you. I sense Shar has offered some amount of protection to you already, but... well, no harm in extra precaution - even from a Sel√ªnite.\nPlayer: Try to understand what's happening.\nNarrator: *Is Lady Shar punishing you? Or perhaps testing you? Is it the tadpole, or a curse? You cannot say.*\nIsobel: Well! If the Moonmaiden didn't strike me dead for blessing you, she must rather approve of this little alliance.\nIsobel: This will block the lesser effects of the shadow curse, allowing you to traverse the darkness outside... should Shar's own protection falter, that is.\nIsobel: Curious. Surely the Nightsinger could have shielded all her followers, and made this place her domain long ago... yet she only acts now, and aids you alone. I wonder why.\nPlayer: That's none of your concern.\nIsobel: I suppose you're right.\nIsobel: I'll stop needling you, though. You have more important things to do, after all.\nPlayer: I've already been to Moonrise, but I have more work to do indeed.\nIsobel: I imagine so, if Jaheira hasn't gone tearing off into the night.\nPlayer: You're coming with me, cleric.",

    "conversation": "[description] CinematicNodeContext: ~Gale holds out his arm. Above the palm of his hand is conjured in gold-coloured magic the image of a woman, the goddess Mystra. He's looking at the figure intensely.\nPlayer: Pretty.\nGale: Oh! My, you startled me. I... I was miles away.\nNodeContext: Gale is looking at a miniature magical projection of Mystra he's created in his hand in his hand. Startled, he dispells it.\nPlayer: Is everything all right?\nGale: Of course, of course. I was just... practising an incantation.\nPlayer: There's more to it than that. The figure I saw: she means something to you.\nGale: She does. She's... She's Mystra.\nGale: I can't quite describe it, the need I sometimes feel to see her - to draw the filaments of fantasy into existence.\nGale: No sculpture or painting could ever do her justice, only the fabric that she herself is and embodies:\nGale: The Weave.\nGale: Mystra is all magic. And as far as I'm concerned, she is all creation.\nPlayer: I quite agree. There's no greater deity than Mystra.\nGale: I see you understand.\nGale: Magic is... my life. I've been in touch with the Weave for as long as I can remember. There's nothing like it.\nGale: It's like music, poetry, physical beauty all rolled into one and given expression through the senses.\nGale: Would you like to experience this?\nPlayer: Yes, I would.\nGale: Then follow my lead.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: ~Gale walks around behind the player (as though teaching them to fly a kite) and makes a delicate gesture with both hands.\nGale: Now you.\nPlayer: Imitate the gesture with ease.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: ~The player imitates the gesture. There‚Äôs a first visual effect. Some sparks of magic start to appear around the player and Gale.\nNarrator: *A familiar feeling - like a kind word and a kind touch at the same time. It's warm and comfortable.*\nGale: Excellent. Now repeat after me: Ah-Thran Mystra-Ryl Kantrach-Ao.\nPlayer: You sense power in these words. Speak them deliberately.\nNarrator: *Suddenly: the scent of rosewater and a sense of wellbeing. A sliver of Weave that tastes sweet on the tongue.*\nGale: Very good. Now I want you to picture in your mind the concept of harmony. As true as you can.\nPlayer: Sink deep into your magic. It is who you are. It is home.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: ~The player and Gale are now fully enveloped in a magic glow - a protective field of beautiful magic. Unconsciously player steps back closer to Gale.\nNarrator: *You see - or is it sense? - the unmistakable presence of Mystra, the Lady of Mysteries.*\nNarrator: *There's something like the anticipation of a kiss, then the pleasure of being cloaked in peace.*\nNarrator: *You are safe. You are nestled in the cup of her hand.*\nGale: You did it. You're channelling the Weave. How does it feel?\nPlayer: It's different, but I can definitely feel a familiar kind of presence.\nGale: Quite so. The Weave is a sensitive conduit.\nNarrator: *The Weave connects you. The moment feels intimate.*\nPlayer: Hold on to the moment. It's a good night for intimacy.\nNarrator: *You realise the Weave is making you one. You have but to imagine your desire, and Gale will know it.*\nPlayer: Picture kicking him in the gut.",

I thought it might make the weight of what I must do feel a little lighter... but I am not so sure.\nPlayer: You speak as if this affects you alone. How many will die if you unleash what's inside you?\nGale: Fewer than if the Absolute goes unchecked. I don't want to kill, and I don't want to die... but inaction will lead to bloodshed all the same.\nGale: I am terrified - I will not claim otherwise. My face could scarcely conceal it even if my words sought to deny it.\nGale: There is no point in running from the inevitable. Better to meet it, on my own terms.\nPlayer: Why are you so sure it's inevitable?

Her hands are in a prayer position and she's chanting softly as the moonlight dances around her. She exhales, then inhales and breaths in tendrils of shadow, absorbing them. She swallows, then begins hacking coughing. The moonlight dissipates. She quickly goes from seeming like a divine spirit to a normal young woman.\nIsobel: I didn't realise I had an audience.\nFist Marcus: Isobel. This is -\nIsobel: A Sharran.\nNarrator: *Isobel. The same name as Ketheric Thorm's daughter - the one whose sarcophagus you found empty in the family mausoleum.*\nPlayer: Push your Urges down.\nPlayer: Isobel - Isobel Thorm?\nNarrator: *Her breath catches; you notice a barely-perceptible shudder run through her body.*\nIsobel: An unfortunate coincidence. I hope never to meet the wicked man who haemorrhaged shadows over this peaceful village. I've heard you might be the person to stop him.\nIsobel: A True Soul with a soul. Imagine.\nIsobel: But if you are who I think you are, I'd be a fool to reject your help. The True Soul with... well, a soul. Imagine.\nPlayer: I may have the parasite of a True Soul, but not the mind of one.\nIsobel: And that's what makes you essential.\nIsobel: You'll be needing the protection spell, I presume?\nIsobel: Oh - aren't you looking for a protection spell?\nPlayer: I am already protected. My Lady shields me from the curse.\nIsobel: For now, perhaps. But Shar can be fickle, and her love can prove fleeting. Do not turn your back on an advantage you may need... even a Sel√ªnite one.\nIsobel: If nothing else, it can aid any companions who travel with you - somehow I doubt Shar's largesse was extended to them.\nNarrator: *Pain bursts from the wound on your hand. You see yourself kneeling in a dark hall, surrounded by initiates. A female voice preaches against Sel√ªne and all she stands for. You nod, rapt.*\nInternalNodeContext: Incurable wound imagery/memoriy fragment\nIsobel: Well! If the Moonmaiden didn't strike me dead for blessing you, she must rather approve of this little alliance.\nIsobel: This will block the lesser effects of the shadow curse, allowing you to traverse the darkness outside... should Shar's own protection falter, that is.\nIsobel: Curious. Surely the Nightsinger could have shielded all her followers, and made this place her domain long ago... yet she only acts now, and aids you alone. I wonder why.\nPlayer: That's none of your concern.\nIsobel: I suppose you're right.\nIsobel: I'll stop needling you, though. You have more important things to do, after all.\nPlayer: You're coming with me, cleric.",

Her hands are in a prayer position and she's chanting softly as the moonlight dances around her. She exhales, then inhales and breaths in tendrils of shadow, absorbing them. She swallows, then begins hacking coughing. The moonlight dissipates. She quickly goes from seeming like a divine spirit to a normal young woman.\nIsobel: I didn't realise I had an audience.\nFist Marcus: Isobel. This is -\nIsobel: A Sharran.\nNarrator: *Isobel. The same name as Ketheric Thorm's daughter - the one whose sarcophagus you found empty in the family mausoleum.*\nPlayer: Push your Urges down.\nPlayer: You can tell my allegiance from a look?\nIsobel: It's an aura. Or a lack of one, really.\nIsobel: Frankly, I'm surprised you're willing to help us. Your kind aren't known for their decency - particularly when a Sharran curse is our greatest obstacle.\nIsobel: But if you are who I think you are, I'd be a fool to reject your help.

Better to humour her than make an enemy of all in this place. Lady Shar will understand.\nIsobel: Refreshingly pragmatic of you. I sense Shar has offered some amount of protection to you already, but... well, no harm in extra precaution - even from a Sel√ªnite.\nNarrator: *Pain bursts from the wound on your hand. You see yourself kneeling in a dark hall, surrounded by initiates. A female voice preaches against Sel√ªne and all she stands for. You nod, rapt.*\nInternalNodeContext: Incurable wound imagery/memoriy fragment\nIsobel: Well! If the Moonmaiden didn't strike me dead for blessing you, she must rather approve of this little alliance.\nIsobel: This will block the lesser effects of the shadow curse, allowing you to traverse the darkness outside... should Shar's own protection falter, that is.\nIsobel: Curious. Surely the Nightsinger could have shielded all her followers, and made this place her domain long ago... yet she only acts now, and aids you alone. I wonder why.\nPlayer: That's none of your concern.\nIsobel: I suppose you're right.\nIsobel: I'll stop needling you, though.

I say we stick a few holes in them... show how grateful we are.\n\nNarrator: *You feel a cold hand caress your mind as the drow appraises you.*\nNightwarden Minthara: Oh dear.

He and I have history.\nJaheira: You were the one who rescued those the Absolute had imprisoned. You were courageous to brave the depths of Ketheric's stronghold.\nJaheira: I suppose you know about Ketheric, then. His invincibility. That we'll never cleanse this place until he's made to bleed.\nJaheira: We met him on the road here - commanding an army of the Absolute, intent on destroying Baldur's Gate. I put an arrow through his eye myself, only to watch him pluck it out like a splinter.\nJaheira: He healed right in front of me, and chased us into the shadows. Things looked hopeless, but experience has taught me that no matter how bleak things look, there's always hope.\nJaheira: You are that hope.\nPlayer: It's rare people look at me and see 'hope'.\nJaheira: The light is rather dim, out here in the shadowlands. The point remains:\nJaheira: Protected by your artefact, you can infiltrate his forces at Moonrise Towers, posing as a True Soul.\nJaheira: Find out what it is that makes him invincible so we can strip him of his advantage.\nJaheira: Once Ketheric is without his shield, the sword: together we assault his tower, and put a final end to this blight.\nPlayer: There's something you should know - Marcus, the Flaming Fist upstairs, is a True Soul. He wants to kidnap Isobel.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Jaheir takes the glass from the table.\nJaheira: This place is crawling with Harpers.

By the looks of it, a tall tale is all you have to offer.\nJaheira: But you're far from the most eccentric drinking companion I've had. I'd like to know more. Cheers.\nJaheira: To your very good health.\nPlayer: Jaheira, there's something you need to know: Marcus is a True Soul, and he's planning to kidnap Isobel.\nJaheira: This place is crawling with Harpers.

Mostly full of tieflin's, but them intruders you're after were hidin' out there!\nNightwarden Minthara: I presume you dealt with my prey, and massacred the rest?\nSazza: Ah... well, the thing about that is... they sorta massacred us.\nSazza: This mug helped me escape though. I say we stick a few holes in them... show how grateful we are.\n\nNarrator: *You feel a cold hand caress your mind as the drow appraises you.*\nNightwarden Minthara: Oh dear. Your prisoner is one of the Absolute's favourites, Sazza. A True Soul.\nSazza: Nah. Can't be... they woz in the grove, hangin' around with the tieflin's.\nNightwarden Minthara: Undercover, no doubt. Carrying out the Absolute's will. Oh, Sazza - you have made a grave error.\nNightwarden Minthara: And it will be your last. My spiders are hungry, little one...\nNightwarden Minthara: ...but before they feast, tell me where that grove is, and I may yet spare your life.\nSazza: It's past the bridge, to the east! Big ol' gate, covered in ivy! Don't hurt me, mistress. Please!\nNightwarden Minthara: I will not hurt you. My spiders will have that pleasure.\nSazza: No! I mucked up, I'm sorry!

When my raiding party approaches, throw open the gate and signal me.\nNarrator: *The fate of the grove's inhabitants hangs in the balance.*\nNarrator: *Killing the drow here would spare them, but it might be better to face her warband at the grove itself, on familiar ground.*\nNarrator: *On the other hand, participating in the slaughter as she asks may be the perfect way to earn her trust, and access to the cult's inner circle.*\nPlayer: I want no part of this.\nNightwarden Minthara: I do not intend to lead a suicidal charge. The goblins are expendable; I am not.\nNightwarden Minthara: The Absolute brought you here for a reason - to throw open those gates and crush our enemies.\nPlayer: All right.

Day will come all too soon, even in this place.\nPlayer: I'm not going anywhere, Gale. I'll be by your side, whatever dawn brings.\nGale: Yes... but there is so much to live for, and so few moments in which to house it all.\nGale: Damn you. Damn you for giving me so much to care about. Our friends, our adventures... this would have been so much easier if it was just me. But it isn't.\nGale: If there is a way - any way - to save all that's grown dear to me, I want to seize it. I just can't fathom what that might be, other than to fail Mystra and condemn the world.\nGale: Stay with me, will you?

My spiders are hungry, little one...\nNightwarden Minthara: ...but before they feast, tell me where that grove is, and I may yet spare your life.\nSazza: It's past the bridge, to the east!

You know what's at stake here, I take it?\nPlayer: Judging by how you're cowering in here, your survival?\nBalthazar: I do not cower - I plan. I command. I create.\nBalthazar: General Thorm trusts me. He knows I will deliver. He knows I will stand by him long after all others wilt and fall.\nBalthazar: You, Z'rell, all the rest... you have only one body with which to serve. I have as many as I care to make.\nPlayer: Fine, consider your merits acknowledged. Care to enlighten me as to what's going on?\nBalthazar: There is a relic here. One which General Thorm desires. No - needs. I will retrieve it for him...\nBalthazar: ...and you will help me. Ignorant you may be, you've shown some prowess in scouting and combat by making it this far.\nBalthazar: While you, an infinitely more humble servant, fulfil my command. I will put you to work - as a scout.\nNarrator: *This necromancer has Ketheric's trust. Helping him could be just what you need to gain access to the man himself.*\nPlayer: I need more to go on. Why is this relic so important? What does it do?\nBalthazar: Telling you will not make the task any less perilous. Just obey, and use your ignorance as a shield. You should be adept at that already.\nBalthazar: The Nightsong lends the General his strength, his invulnerability. It must be recovered, before his enemies attempt to exploit it.\nPlayer: Sounds like you've good reason to be proud of the Nightsong - tell me more.\nBalthazar: And spoil the surprise? I think not. But let's just say that the Nightsong was a unique specimen even before I began my work...\nBalthazar: Words - even my words - are woefully insufficient. When you see for yourself, you will understand.\nPlayer: What do you need me to do?\nBalthazar: I do not need you, or your help. But you are here in spite of that, so I may as well make use of you.\nBalthazar: The relic is close, but the way is barred and Shar's dead are... uncooperative. Clear the path for me - by blade, cunning, or whatever it takes.\nBalthazar: I will remain here until you have succeeded, or fallen.\nShadowheart: I'd trust this gasbag about as far as I can throw him - which isn't far.

    "conversation": "[description] CinematicNodeContext: Player hands book to Gale\nGale: That devil Raphael was telling the truth. There's no doubt - the Crown of Karsus is what's controlling the elder brain.\nGale: And this - this is no mere journal - it contains Karsus' original plans for the Crown's construction. His designs for godhood.\nPlayer: A design you could follow?\nGale: Not from scratch - unless you happen to have several pounds of the purest Netherese metals in that pack of yours?\nGale: Don't worry - I'm not asking you to surrender anything else on my account. What's called for here is something altogether different.\nGale: The book states that the Crown and Netherstones were originally one construct, seemingly sundered at the moment of Karsus' downfall.\nGale: If we can collect the crown's setting, and the three Netherstones, and with the correct invocation of certain spells and gestures detailed in these notes... I think I could reforge it.\nPlayer: That Crown's caused chaos. We should be seeking a way to destroy it, not make it more powerful.\nGale: Do not mistake the crown itself for the actions of its wearer, or rather, those controlling its wearer at present.\nGale: If we could restore its former glory, it would no longer be a mere leash and collar, used to subjugate friend or foe. It would be something greater. Something divine.\nGale: Just think of it... the power of the gods in mortal hands at last. We'd be free of doctrine and dogma, confined only by the limits of our imaginations.\nGale: I promise you - the gods will never grant us such a blessing, no matter how much we worship and adore them.\nPlayer: Mortals are far better guardians of their fates than the gods. We have more to lose.\nGale: Then you're already wiser than me. That's a lesson I've only recently learned.\nGale: I worshipped Mystra loyally for years, and in that time she granted me the barest sliver of the power I was ready to wield.\nGale: Even with the fate of the world at stake, she had little more to offer me than the means of blowing myself up at a more convenient time. She's done nothing to help us.\nGale: Mystra wanted the brain obliterated because of this crown. She fears a world in which such power is beyond her control - ready to be claimed by Karsus' successor.\nPlayer: This is no ordinary artefact, Gale. Do this and you'd challenge the gods themselves.\nGale: Perhaps they deserve to be challenged. Perhaps you and I deserve better than to live and die as their pawns.\nGale: Ambition is not a sin. To question the powers that rule us is not treason. We must at least try - why wallow in the dirt when we can reach for the stars?\nGale: A long road lies ahead before the Crown comes into our possession. All I ask for now is that you not dismiss this possibility out of hand. Please - at least think on it.\nPlayer: Gale - I'm urging you to drop this. This Crown cannot be reforged.\nGale: I see. I suppose I am asking you to take a leap of faith even the most loyal of companions might struggle to land gracefully.",

That's all I know.\nPlayer: As you mention serving Ketheric, he sent you to find a relic, no?\nBalthazar: General Thorm to you. But yes, recovering the relic is the crux of it. He commands, and I, his humble servant, fulfil that command.\nBalthazar: While you, an infinitely more humble servant, fulfil my command. I will put you to work - as a scout.\nNarrator: *This necromancer has Ketheric's trust.

You know what's at stake here, I take it?\nPlayer: Z'rell said Ketheric wants you to find a relic. That's all I know.\nPlayer: As you mention serving Ketheric, he sent you to find a relic, no?\nBalthazar: General Thorm to you. But yes, recovering the relic is the crux of it. He commands, and I, his humble servant, fulfil that command.\nBalthazar: While you, an infinitely more humble servant, fulfil my command. I will put you to work - as a scout.\nNarrator: *This necromancer has Ketheric's trust. Helping him could be just what you need to gain access to the man himself.*\nPlayer: So you need my help - what would I have to do?\nPlayer: What do you need me to do?\nBalthazar: I do not need you, or your help. But you are here in spite of that, so I may as well make use of you.\nBalthazar: The relic is close, but the way is barred and Shar's dead are... uncooperative. Clear the path for me - by blade, cunning, or whatever it takes.\nBalthazar: I will remain here until you have succeeded, or fallen.\nShadowheart: I'd trust this gasbag about as far as I can throw him - which isn't far. But perhaps better to play along, for now.\nPlayer: For jobs like this it's good form to provide your operatives some extra resources.\nBalthazar: Fine. I will assign Flesh to aid you on your way. Ring this bell...\nBalthazar: ...Hmm. Misplaced, it seems. You will be capable enough without it.\nPlayer: I'll see what I can do.",

There's no doubt - the Crown of Karsus is what's controlling the elder brain.\nGale: And this - this is no mere journal - it contains Karsus' original plans for the Crown's construction. His designs for godhood.\nPlayer: Karsus? Crown? You might need to catch me up a bit...\nGale: Karsus. The child-who-would-become-a-god. He was the most powerful wizard ever known... and he attempted to unseat the goddess of magic herself.\nGale: Only she used the last of her power to block him from the Weave. His magic faltered. The great flying cities of Netheril plunged from the sky. Karsus' Folly.\nGale: That goddess of magic was reborn as Mystra. She ruled on, while Netherese magic was reduced to mere fragments of what Karsus once wielded - artefacts, the most powerful of which appears to be his Crown.\nGale: The book states that the Crown and Netherstones were originally one construct, seemingly sundered at the moment of Karsus' downfall.\nGale: If we can collect the crown's setting, and the three Netherstones, and with the correct invocation of certain spells and gestures detailed in these notes... I think I could reforge it.\nPlayer: We already know the crown's dangerous. Wouldn't that make things worse?\nGale: Worse? It could be the best thing that ever happened to me. To us.\nGale: Just think of it... the power of the gods in mortal hands at last. We'd be free of doctrine and dogma, confined only by the limits of our imaginations.\nGale: I promise you - the gods will never grant us such a blessing, no matter how much we worship and adore them.\nPlayer: You dismiss the entire pantheon so easily. Not all gods are selfish.\nGale: Some gods may delude themselves into believing they care about their worshippers, but when it comes down to it - we're all expendable. Children to be appeased, not respected.\nGale: I worshipped Mystra loyally for years, and in that time she granted me the barest sliver of the power I was ready to wield.\nGale: Even with the fate of the world at stake, she had little more to offer me than the means of blowing myself up at a more convenient time. She's done nothing to help us.\nGale: Mystra wanted the brain obliterated because of this crown. She fears a world in which such power is beyond her control - ready to be claimed by Karsus' successor.\nPlayer: This is no ordinary artefact, Gale. Do this and you'd challenge the gods themselves.\nGale: Perhaps they deserve to be challenged. Perhaps you and I deserve better than to live and die as their pawns.\nGale: Ambition is not a sin. To question the powers that rule us is not treason. We must at least try - why wallow in the dirt when we can reach for the stars?\nGale: A long road lies ahead before the Crown comes into our possession. All I ask for now is that you not dismiss this possibility out of hand. Please - at least think on it.\nPlayer: Gale - I'm urging you to drop this. This Crown cannot be reforged.\nGale: I see.

Blessed and adored.\nNightwarden Minthara: Now I know that those memories are lies.\nNightwarden Minthara: There was no god.

And I will smile.\nPlayer: Once she's dead, the cult will need new leadership - perhaps we can take her place.\nNightwarden Minthara: It is as if you read my mind. Perhaps you did.\nPlayer: Tempting, but eradicating the brain may be wiser, to put an end to this madness.\nNightwarden Minthara: Madness would be to let the Absolute's potential go to waste.\nNightwarden Minthara: The power of the enslaved elder brain could reshape the world.

And remember, I know when your mind is closed.\nNightwarden Minthara: We are bound, then, to travel together, even if we do not yet agree on our ultimate purpose.\nNightwarden Minthara: There is yet one thing about you that troubles me, though. Something I need you to explain.\nNightwarden Minthara: When we killed the tieflings, at the grove, I was not in control of my actions. You do not have that excuse. So I ask you - why?

The preamble to a civilisation's downfall, committed to parchment by the very hand that wrought its destruction.\nGale: If the crown atop the elder brain was truly forged by Karsus himself, this book will confirm it. All we have to do is turn the page...\nGale: If my suspicions are correct, the crown currently perched atop the elder brain may be one of Karsus' design. And now we hold the very tome that could confirm it.\nPlayer: Don't stand on ceremony - see what it says.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Gale takes book out (of his own inventory),\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Player hands book to Gale\nGale: That devil Raphael was telling the truth. There's no doubt - the Crown of Karsus is what's controlling the elder brain.\nGale: And this - this is no mere journal - it contains Karsus' original plans for the Crown's construction. His designs for godhood.\nPlayer: A design you could follow?\nGale: Not from scratch - unless you happen to have several pounds of the purest Netherese metals in that pack of yours?\nGale: Don't worry - I'm not asking you to surrender anything else on my account. What's called for here is something altogether different.\nGale: The book states that the Crown and Netherstones were originally one construct, seemingly sundered at the moment of Karsus' downfall.\nGale: If we can collect the crown's setting, and the three Netherstones, and with the correct invocation of certain spells and gestures detailed in these notes... I think I could reforge it.\nPlayer: That Crown's caused chaos. We should be seeking a way to destroy it, not make it more powerful.\nGale: Do not mistake the crown itself for the actions of its wearer, or rather, those controlling its wearer at present.\nGale: If we could restore its former glory, it would no longer be a mere leash and collar, used to subjugate friend or foe. It would be something greater. Something divine.\nGale: Just think of it... the power of the gods in mortal hands at last. We'd be free of doctrine and dogma, confined only by the limits of our imaginations.\nGale: I promise you - the gods will never grant us such a blessing, no matter how much we worship and adore them.\nPlayer: And you think Mystra will let you do this?\nGale: I don't know. Ao does not look kindly on gods meddling in mortal affairs - she may have no choice but to stand by and let events unfold.\nGale: Even with the fate of the world at stake, she had little more to offer me than the means of blowing myself up at a more convenient time. She's done nothing to help us.\nGale: Mystra wanted the brain obliterated because of this crown. She fears a world in which such power is beyond her control - ready to be claimed by Karsus' successor.\nPlayer: Or to destroy the next wizard who attempts it. The attempt would kill you as it killed Karsus.\nGale: Do you think I had not considered that? I have no intention of repeating his folly.\nGale: Powerful as he was, Karsus lacked some advantages I can lay claim to.\nGale: I know Mystra - intimately. And I carry a fragment of the Weave itself within my body. Karsus achieved many things, but he never managed that.\nGale: A long road lies ahead before the Crown comes into our possession. All I ask for now is that you not dismiss this possibility out of hand. Please - at least think on it.\nPlayer: What you're suggesting is blasphemy. You'd be wise to banish these notions from your head.\nGale: I see. I suppose I am asking you to take a leap of faith even the most loyal of companions might struggle to land gracefully.",

And now we hold the very tome that could confirm it.\nPlayer: Don't stand on ceremony - see what it says.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Gale takes book out (of his own inventory),\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Player hands book to Gale\nGale: That devil Raphael was telling the truth. There's no doubt - the Crown of Karsus is what's controlling the elder brain.\nGale: And this - this is no mere journal - it contains Karsus' original plans for the Crown's construction. His designs for godhood.\nPlayer: Stay silent.\nGale: The book states that the Crown and Netherstones were originally one construct, seemingly sundered at the moment of Karsus' downfall.\nGale: If we can collect the crown's setting, and the three Netherstones, and with the correct invocation of certain spells and gestures detailed in these notes... I think I could reforge it.\nPlayer: To what end?\nGale: To every end you can imagine, and a thousand more beyond.\nGale: Just think of it... the power of the gods in mortal hands at last. We'd be free of doctrine and dogma, confined only by the limits of our imaginations.\nGale: I promise you - the gods will never grant us such a blessing, no matter how much we worship and adore them.\nPlayer: You dismiss the entire pantheon so easily. Not all gods are selfish.\nGale: Some gods may delude themselves into believing they care about their worshippers, but when it comes down to it - we're all expendable. Children to be appeased, not respected.\nGale: I worshipped Mystra loyally for years, and in that time she granted me the barest sliver of the power I was ready to wield.\nGale: Even with the fate of the world at stake, she had little more to offer me than the means of blowing myself up at a more convenient time. She's done nothing to help us.\nGale: Mystra wanted the brain obliterated because of this crown. She fears a world in which such power is beyond her control - ready to be claimed by Karsus' successor.\nPlayer: This is no ordinary artefact, Gale. Do this and you'd challenge the gods themselves.\nGale: Perhaps they deserve to be challenged. Perhaps you and I deserve better than to live and die as their pawns.\nGale: Ambition is not a sin. To question the powers that rule us is not treason. We must at least try - why wallow in the dirt when we can reach for the stars?\nGale: A long road lies ahead before the Crown comes into our possession. All I ask for now is that you not dismiss this possibility out of hand. Please - at least think on it.\nPlayer: What you're suggesting is blasphemy. You'd be wise to banish these notions from your head.\nGale: I see. I suppose I am asking you to take a leap of faith even the most loyal of companions might struggle to land gracefully.",

You should be pleased.\nBalthazar: I take it the breaking of my skeletons was an accident - the living are so clumsy, after all.\nPlayer: I'm pleased to be of service, Balthazar.\nBalthazar: Perhaps you can prove to me that you're more useful alive than dead. You know what's at stake here, I take it?\nBalthazar: But you're here now, and I may be able to put those limbs to work. You know what's at stake here, I take it?\nPlayer: Judging by how you're cowering in here, your survival?\nBalthazar: I do not cower - I plan. I command. I create.\nBalthazar: General Thorm trusts me. He knows I will deliver. He knows I will stand by him long after all others wilt and fall.\nBalthazar: You, Z'rell, all the rest... you have only one body with which to serve. I have as many as I care to make.\nPlayer: Fine, consider your merits acknowledged. Care to enlighten me as to what's going on?\nBalthazar: There is a relic here. One which General Thorm desires. No - needs. I will retrieve it for him...\nBalthazar: ...and you will help me. Ignorant you may be, you've shown some prowess in scouting and combat by making it this far.\nBalthazar: While you, an infinitely more humble servant, fulfil my command. I will put you to work - as a scout.\nNarrator: *This necromancer has Ketheric's trust. Helping him could be just what you need to gain access to the man himself.*\nPlayer: Jobs like this always go smoother when I know exactly what I'm looking for.\nPlayer: I need more to go on. Why is this relic so important? What does it do?\nBalthazar: Telling you will not make the task any less perilous. Just obey, and use your ignorance as a shield. You should be adept at that already.\nBalthazar: The Nightsong lends the General his strength, his invulnerability. It must be recovered, before his enemies attempt to exploit it.\nPlayer: Sounds like you've good reason to be proud of the Nightsong - tell me more.\nBalthazar: And spoil the surprise? I think not. But let's just say that the Nightsong was a unique specimen even before I began my work...\nBalthazar: Words - even my words - are woefully insufficient. When you see for yourself, you will understand.\nPlayer: What do you need me to do?\nBalthazar: I do not need you, or your help. But you are here in spite of that, so I may as well make use of you.\nBalthazar: The Nightsong is close, but the way is barred and Shar's dead are... uncooperative. Clear the path for me - by blade, cunning, or whatever it takes.\nBalthazar: I will remain here until you have succeeded, or fallen.\nShadowheart: I'd trust this gasbag about as far as I can throw him - which isn't far. But perhaps better to play along, for now.\nPlayer: For jobs like this it's good form to provide your operatives some extra resources.\nBalthazar: Fine. I will assign Flesh to aid you on your way. Ring this bell...\nBalthazar: ...and he will come.\nBalthazar: My brother is no intellectual powerhouse, but he is strong, loyal and punctual. Should a fight turn against you, remember the bell.\nPlayer: Keep it - this is your problem, not mine.\nBalthazar: This is not a problem - it is an opportunity. And it is not a choice either - you will obey.\nPlayer: Fine. I'll see what I can do.\nPlayer: I'll see what I can do.",

The same as you - a humble supplicant, come to bargain with the lady of this house.\nGandrel: A sharp wit will serve you better, if you're to bargain with the lady of this house.\nGandrel: That is why you come to her lair, I take it? To bargain?\nPlayer: My business here is my own.\nGandrel: As you like. But you needn't be coy - whatever's worth knowing, rest assured she already knows it.\nGandrel: Her kind have hidden among us since the first darkness - and their knowledge is matched only by their spite.\nGandrel: Know how to ask, and they'll share that knowledge. If you're fool enough to pay their price.\nPlayer: Speak for yourself - I got what I wanted.\nGandrel: So said the fish 'round the hook in its mouth.\nGandrel: But, one fool to another, I can't say I judge you. The thing I hunt has slipped away from me.\nGandrel: If she can tell me how to flush him out, I'll pay whatever price she asks.\nGandrel: But she thrives on suffering. Once she hears what awaits my quarry when I catch him, she will help.\nPlayer: Who is it you're hunting?\nGandrel: Truth is like a blade, my friend. We can arm ourselves with it.\nGandrel: Or just as easily find it pressed against our throat. I would not put you in danger.\nPlayer: Come now - I've almost certainly killed worse.\nGandrel: I would not be so sure. But I won't keep the truth from you.\nGandrel: I hunt a vampire spawn called Astarion. I'm bound to bring him back to Baldur's Gate - alive.\nGandrel: Though I cannot swear to his condition once my tribe are done with him. Is he known to you?\nPlayer: We've met - he's not the type to come quietly.\nGandrel: You do know him? I don't suppose you'll tell me where he is?\nGandrel: But you're right - he's no true vampire. Not yet. I don't suppose you'll tell me where he is?\nPlayer: Tell him how to find your camp.",

You know what's at stake here, I take it?\nBalthazar: But you're here now, and I may be able to put those limbs to work. You know what's at stake here, I take it?\nPlayer: Something called the Nightsong. Your notes were very interesting.\nPlayer: Yet you seem no closer to retrieving the Nightsong? I read your notes - very interesting.\nBalthazar: Interesting, and private. Give me one reason why I shouldn't have my creations kill you right now, thief.\nPlayer: I had Z'rell's permission - that good enough for you?\nBalthazar: Z'rell exceeds her authority. But fine, I'll overlook your transgressions this time - there are much grander things at stake.\nBalthazar: The Nightsong is my finest creation - if I never exceed myself, I will still die happy. Not that I ever intend to do something as gauche as truly dying, of course.\nBalthazar: Now, given your prying nature, I have work for you, as a scout.\nBalthazar: The Nightsong lends the General his strength, his invulnerability. It must be recovered, before his enemies attempt to exploit it.\nPlayer: Sounds like you've good reason to be proud of the Nightsong - tell me more.\nBalthazar: And spoil the surprise? I think not. But let's just say that the Nightsong was a unique specimen even before I began my work...\nBalthazar: Words - even my words - are woefully insufficient. When you see for yourself, you will understand.\nPlayer: What do you need me to do?\nBalthazar: I do not need you, or your help. But you are here in spite of that, so I may as well make use of you.\nBalthazar: The relic is close, but the way is barred and Shar's dead are... uncooperative. Clear the path for me - by blade, cunning, or whatever it takes.\nBalthazar: I will remain here until you have succeeded, or fallen.\nShadowheart: I'd trust this gasbag about as far as I can throw him - which isn't far.

Ring this bell...\nBalthazar: ...and he will come.\nBalthazar: My brother is no intellectual powerhouse, but he is strong, loyal and punctual. Should a fight turn against you, remember the bell.\nPlayer: Keep it - this is your problem, not mine.\nBalthazar: This is not a problem - it is an opportunity. And it is not a choice either - you will obey.\nPlayer: Fine. I'll see what I can do.\nPlayer: I'll see what I can do.",

To bargain?\nPlayer: Not at all. I was invited for tea.\nGandrel: Of course - as the spider invites the fly. You need something, I expect.

If she can tell me how to draw him out, I'll pay whatever she asks.\nGandrel: But she thrives on suffering. Once she hears what awaits my quarry when I catch him, she will help.\nPlayer: I'd advise against helping such a creature thrive.

But for such an offer, an answer at least is owed.\nGandrel: I hunt a vampire spawn called Astarion.

So pure - so complete - that I didn't even recognise it at first...\nGale: Most Netherese artefacts contain only the faintest amount of their former power - the ghost of an echo of a memory... that crown was different.\nGale: I can't fathom how such a wonder survived - surely everything of its ilk was destroyed along with Netheril itself... but no matter. It exists, and I must learn more of it.\nPlayer: Back up a little - why is this crown so important all of a sudden?\nGale: That crown sits on a gargantuan elder brain bent on destroying us and everything we hold dear. Understanding its true nature might unlock the means of our victory.\nGale: We need to learn more about what we saw.

His designs for godhood.\nPlayer: How did such a powerful object end up in the hands of the Absolute?\nGale: I haven't the foggiest. No doubt through some nefarious means - the crown's existence had been consigned to legend centuries ago.\nGale: The book states that the Crown and Netherstones were originally one construct, seemingly sundered at the moment of Karsus' downfall.\nGale: If we can collect the crown's setting, and the three Netherstones, and with the correct invocation of certain spells and gestures detailed in these notes... I think I could reforge it.\nPlayer: We already know the crown's dangerous. Wouldn't that make things worse?\nGale: Worse? It could be the best thing that ever happened to me.

The attempt would kill you as it killed Karsus.\nGale: Do you think I had not considered that? I have no intention of repeating his folly.\nGale: Powerful as he was, Karsus lacked some advantages I can lay claim to.\nGale: I know Mystra - intimately. And I carry a fragment of the Weave itself within my body. Karsus achieved many things, but he never managed that.\nGale: A long road lies ahead before the Crown comes into our possession.

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon‚Äôs voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar.\nMalus Thorm: See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy.\nMalus Thorm: Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human‚Äôs belly, but it‚Äôs a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace.\nMalus Thorm: Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver.\nMalus Thorm: Come. Step forward. I can see the love of Shar darken your eyes. Be welcome.\nPlayer: May Shar guide your blessing hands.\nMalus Thorm: And the rough vessels that are yours.\nMalus Thorm: Tell me, what is the guiding principle of the goddess?\nPlayer: Forgetfulness.\nMalus Thorm: I profess there is another more profound.\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly.\nMalus Thorm: It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nAstarion: He's just like Cazador - utterly insane.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being?\nMalus Thorm: If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: You are well on your way. But one white orb disfigures you still. Let us finish the cure.\nMalus Thorm: We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: Your subject is tainted. Shar's succour must only be granted to the willing.\nMalus Thorm: Hmmm. 'Only the willing may know the Lady's embrace.' You know her teachings well.\nMalus Thorm: And yet, these sisters must exercise their gifts, for the art of absence lies in its execution.\nMalus Thorm: How to proceed, I wonder.\nPlayer: The sisters require a willing volunteer, a master of the art.\nMalus Thorm: I see now.

Her mother has no idea of what she's up against. Poor woman thinks the Fist will be able to help her.\nMayrina: The moment I started investigating the missing girl, I felt the hag's eye on me. Next thing, I was sprouting wool and bleating up a storm.\nPlayer: Let me guess - you want me to help.\nMayrina: You've seen what Ethel did - imagine the destruction a hag could cause in a city this size? With people this desperate?\nMayrina: Look, I know you're busy with big-time heroics, but we need your help.

She sought a githyanki egg.\nHavkelaag: Yes, dear Lady Esther. One of our most reliable contractors, though unfortunately this particular request was too much even for her.\nHavkelaag: I believe she quite lost her senses over the task. She came here insisting I purchase an owlbear egg from her, of all things.\nHavkelaag: I don't suppose you've stumbled across any githyanki eggs during your travels? The Society will compensate you for any we purchase, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nHavkelaag: Would you consider parting with it? The Society's coffers are deep enough to cover any expenses accrued in its retrieval, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: Chk. Don't you dare consider it.\nPlayer: What are you going to do with it?\nHavkelaag: Study it, of course. The githyanki have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months.\nHavkelaag: You yourself have no doubt experienced the prejudice of those who assume that, as beings of the Underdark, we are inherently evil.\nHavkelaag: The githyanki face similar prejudice, but I believe, if hatched in a less violent, more intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome its evil predispositions.\nHavkelaag: I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: So the child inside will be experimented on?\nHavkelaag: Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach:\nHavkelaag: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue.\nHavkelaag: Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: You would teach the child virtue, but rear it without patience. Curious.\nHavkelaag: Tell me, then, philosopher - if patience delays the fostering of the other virtues, can it be rightly called virtuous?\nPlayer: Perhaps not. Patience is important, but cannot impede the other virtues.\nHavkelaag: Then we are in accord - the time for action is now.\nHavkelaag: My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: Your findings are irrelevant, as are the opinions of all on this kaincha plane.\nHavkelaag: Ah. A display of the well-known githyanki arrogance. I am not sure my experiment can cure that particular affliction, but give me time and I will find a way.\nHavkelaag: Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg? ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: A gith hatchling is not a lab rat! This shka'keth should be bled dry for the mere suggestion.\nPlayer: Sell the egg.\nHavkelaag: Ah. Unfortunately, it seems I've mislaid my purse.\nHavkelaag: I don't suppose you'd consider simply donating it to the Society instead?\nPlayer: Fine. Here you go.",

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon‚Äôs voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar.\nMalus Thorm: See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy.\nMalus Thorm: Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human‚Äôs belly, but it‚Äôs a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace.\nMalus Thorm: Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver.\nMalus Thorm: Come. Step forward. You are no sister, but that matters none. Every student is welcome.\nPlayer: I am no student, I seek knowledge of the curse. It is a blight on this land.\nMalus Thorm: A curse? Nay, a cure that leads to the very pinnacle of being:\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly.\nMalus Thorm: It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nAstarion: He's just like Cazador - utterly insane.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being?\nMalus Thorm: If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: But you: look how the succour of Shar eludes even you, one who walks faithfully in her shadow. See how painfully present you remain...\nMalus Thorm: We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: Their blades are uneven. Efficient surgery will require further training.\nMalus Thorm: Their incisions are, as yet, still streaked with imprecision - that much I must concede.\nMalus Thorm: How to steady their hands, I wonder.\nPlayer: Sparring is vital to progress. Have them practice on each other.\nPlayer: Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\nMalus Thorm: Yes... For are we not all in need of a cure?\nMalus Thorm: The scalpel does not discriminate. Let each and every one of you partake in its soothing journey.\nMalus Thorm: Absence, sisters. Acquaint yourselves.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) Screaming and slashing, the sisters brutally murder each other.\nMalus Thorm: It is a proud moment when one sees one's teachings so lovingly taken to heart.\nMalus Thorm: You are to be commended for their graduation - rewarded with the promised cure.\nMalus Thorm: Come, I will acquaint you with the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nPlayer: My magic has blinded me - I see now that Shar is the only path. Show me how - I beg of you.\nPlayer: I would rather acquaint myself - if you show me how.\nMalus Thorm: Your diligence is exemplary. Very well: your own scalpel you will be.",

One should cherish all of nature's bounty... but goblin guts are quite far down the list.\nNodeContext: Hint of wry humour, Introducing himself after transforming from an owlbear and killing several goblins.\nHalsin: Not only do you speak with a bear, but you free it, too? A true friend of nature - or perhaps a lunatic.\nHalsin: Either way, I owe thanks. I am the druid Halsin.\nPlayer: Glad I could be of help.\nHalsin: I must admit, I didn't expect anyone would come to my aid. Who in their right mind would infiltrate a goblin infested temple. Unless...\nHalsin: ...Hrrm. That look in your eyes - I've seen it before. Are you feeling all right?\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Halsin raises a hand to your head, magically connecting with you (no contact). He gives an alarmed look - he knows what‚Äôs inside you\nHalsin: Oak Father preserve you, child... You're infected, aren't you? The mind flayers' spawn.\nHalsin: But... something's different. You're aware of the monster inside you. You don't bow to the Absolute, like the True Souls do...\nHalsin: How is this possible...?\nPlayer: I think this artefact has something to do with it.\nHalsin: Hmmm... that looks very alien. As alien as the mind flayers. They do not belong on this world.\nHalsin: It's no coincidence that you found me here, I'll wager? You're after a cure for this parasite.\nHalsin: I've been studying these parasites for a while now. Ever since I discovered these so-called True Souls are infected with them.\nHalsin: Someone is using very powerful magic to modify these tadpoles. They are using them to exert control over the infected.\nHalsin: I'm sorry to say, I can't undo that magic, which means I can't cure you. But that doesn't mean I can't help.\nHalsin: I didn't find what I came here for - a way to remove the tadpoles - but I found the next best thing. I found out where they come from.\nHalsin: That must be where these enchantments are placed on them, and it's where you'll find your cure.\nPlayer: Tell me what you've learned about the tadpoles' origins.\nHalsin: I overheard that the cultists are sending all of their captives to Moonrise Towers.\nHalsin: Innocents go in, True Souls come out. Given that all of these True Souls are infected, it has to be the source of this magic.\nHalsin: If you want to find a cure, you must head there and discover how the tadpoles are being manipulated.\nPlayer: You seem to know a lot about this. Will you come with me to Moonrise?\nHalsin: I wish I could, but there's still work I've yet to finish - blood I've yet to spill.\nHalsin: I've no right to ask more of you... but if you could help me, I'd be free to join your journey to Moonrise.\nHalsin: I cannot allow these butchers to threaten my grove. The natural order must be protected.\nPlayer: Kagha was swayed by Shadow Druids. She nearly sealed the grove.\nHalsin: Kagha... I should have suspected she'd take things too far. I'll deal with her when I can.\nHalsin: But there are other matters to attend to before that.\nHalsin: Chaos is welcome, in doses; it helps keep balance. But this is too much - this is unnatural.\nHalsin: Help me kill the leaders of this horde, save my grove. Then I will help you.\n\nHalsin: Three deaths could win us peace: the drow Minthara, the hobgoblin Dror Ragzlin, and that perversion of a priestess, Gut.\nHalsin: They are the ones holding these parasites together. Remove them and nature will cure itself.\nPlayer: You are aware you're asking me to kill a drow?\nHalsin: You drow relish turning on your own, if there's something to be gained. Don't pretend otherwise.\nPlayer: Not all drow are as you say.\nHalsin: Unfair of me, perhaps, but I've had few encounters with drow to make me think otherwise.\nHalsin: Perhaps you can enlighten me.\nPlayer: Having a shapeshifting bear-druid at my side might make things easier.\nPlayer: Follow me, then. Your bear form may prove useful.\nHalsin: Be warned - my presence could make things more difficult... I can only restrain my bear form so much. I won't be able to help but attack goblins.\nHalsin: If I join you, we'll likely have to slaughter this entire place. You may want to use discretion when approaching the goblin leaders.\nPlayer: Come with me.\nHalsin: So be it. May Silvanus lend us nature's fury.",

The druids blame us 'outsiders' for drawing them here. Nobody's welcome anymore.\nZevlor: They've started a ritual to cut the grove off from the world outside.\nZevlor: We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: What brought you here?\nZevlor: We're refugees from Elturel - we took shelter here after gnolls attacked us on the road.\nZevlor: We were bound for Baldur's Gate, and it was too late to turn back. Elturel had no place for tieflings after the Descent.\nNarrator: *You remember it. Elturel and all its citizens were dragged into Avernus - then back out again.*\nPlayer: I was there, you know.

Kagha - their new First Druid - won't even see me.\nZevlor: You, though... I know it's not your business, but she owes you for saving this place.\nZevlor: Perhaps you could persuade her. For more time to prepare, if nothing else.\nPlayer: I'll see what I can do.\nPlayer: I'll find her. And I'll speak to Kagha while I'm there.",

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon‚Äôs voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar.\nMalus Thorm: See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy.\nMalus Thorm: Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human‚Äôs belly, but it‚Äôs a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace.\nMalus Thorm: Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver.\nMalus Thorm: Come. Step forward. I can see the love of Shar darken your eyes. Be welcome.\nPlayer: May Shar guide your blessing hands.\nMalus Thorm: And the rough vessels that are yours.\nMalus Thorm: Tell me, what is the guiding principle of the goddess?\nPlayer: Secrecy.\nMalus Thorm: I profess there is another more profound.\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly.\nMalus Thorm: It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nAstarion: He's just like Cazador - utterly insane.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being?\nMalus Thorm: If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: You are well on your way. But one white orb disfigures you still. Let us finish the cure.\nMalus Thorm: We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: Your subject is tainted. Shar's succour must only be granted to the willing.\nMalus Thorm: Hmmm. 'Only the willing may know the Lady's embrace.' You know her teachings well.\nMalus Thorm: And yet, these sisters must exercise their gifts, for the art of absence lies in its execution.\nMalus Thorm: How to proceed, I wonder.\nPlayer: Practice - that's how I got good with a blade. They should spar each other.\nPlayer: Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\nMalus Thorm: Yes... For are we not all in need of a cure?\nMalus Thorm: The scalpel does not discriminate. Let each and every one of you partake in its soothing journey.\nMalus Thorm: Absence, sisters. Acquaint yourselves.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) Screaming and slashing, the sisters brutally murder each other.\nMalus Thorm: It is a proud moment when one sees one's teachings so lovingly taken to heart.\nMalus Thorm: You are to be commended for their graduation - rewarded with the promised cure.\nMalus Thorm: Come, I will acquaint you with the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nPlayer: I am but a fumbling squire before a master swordsman. Please, demonstrate so that I might learn.\nPlayer: I would rather acquaint myself - if you show me how.\nMalus Thorm: Your diligence is exemplary. Very well: your own scalpel you will be.",

She cuts into the human‚Äôs belly, but it‚Äôs a superficial and hesitant incision.

If you're fool enough to pay their price.\nPlayer: What price is that?\nGandrel: Whatever's easiest to lose and hardest to do without.\nGandrel: But the thing I hunt has gone to ground.

Would you be interested in studying it?\nHavkelaag: A githyanki egg? What a fortuitous turn of events. I've been attempting to get my hands on one for some time now.\nHavkelaag: Would you consider parting with it? The Society's coffers are deep enough to cover any expenses accrued in its retrieval, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: Chk. Don't you dare consider it.\nPlayer: What are you going to do with it?\nHavkelaag: Study it, of course. Your kind have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months.\nHavkelaag: Most on this plane believe you to be innately cruel, violent beings. Evil, if you will.\nHavkelaag: As citizens of the Underdark, we face similar stigmas. Totally unfounded, of course - our natures are as unfixed as any who walk the surface.\nHavkelaag: I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: You're letting your personal biases affect your method. Why assume they're evil?\nHavkelaag: I assume nothing. Innate githyanki cruelty is an established fact - no doubt you witnessed it yourself in the retrieval of the egg itself.\nHavkelaag: When I have a suitable sample for my study, I will, however, prove that the effects of their biological inclination are reversible.\nHavkelaag: Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach:\nHavkelaag: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue.\nHavkelaag: Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: You would teach the child virtue, but rear it without patience. Curious.\nHavkelaag: Tell me, then, philosopher - if patience delays the fostering of the other virtues, can it be rightly called virtuous?\nPlayer: Perhaps not. Patience is important, but cannot impede the other virtues.\nHavkelaag: Then we are in accord - the time for action is now.\nHavkelaag: My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: An experiment like this will only confirm the surface dwellers' suspicion of us.\nHavkelaag: Of course it won't. If anything, it will do quite the opposite. The academic institutions up here will finally be forced to take us seriously.\nHavkelaag: Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg? ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: A gith hatchling is not a lab rat! This shka'keth should be bled dry for the mere suggestion.\nPlayer: Sell the egg.\nHavkelaag: Ah. Unfortunately, it seems I've mislaid my purse.\nHavkelaag: I don't suppose you'd consider simply donating it to the Society instead?\nPlayer: Fine. Here you go.",

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon‚Äôs voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar.\nMalus Thorm: See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy.\nMalus Thorm: Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human‚Äôs belly, but it‚Äôs a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace.\nMalus Thorm: Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver.\nMalus Thorm: Come. Step forward. I can see the love of Shar darken your eyes. Be welcome.\nPlayer: May Shar guide your blessing hands.\nMalus Thorm: And the rough vessels that are yours.\nMalus Thorm: Tell me, what is the guiding principle of the goddess?\nPlayer: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Precisely.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly.\nMalus Thorm: It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nAstarion: He's just like Cazador - utterly insane.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being?\nMalus Thorm: If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: But you: look how the succour of Shar eludes even you, one who walks faithfully in her shadow. See how painfully present you remain...\nMalus Thorm: We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: Their blades are uneven. Efficient surgery will require further training.\nMalus Thorm: Their incisions are, as yet, still streaked with imprecision - that much I must concede.\nMalus Thorm: How to steady their hands, I wonder.\nPlayer: I take joy in performing with a master of my craft - I'm sure the sisters are the same. Why don't you volunteer?\nPlayer: In my years of study, I have found no better teacher than example. Perhaps you could volunteer?\nMalus Thorm: I see now. By example I must edify and quell the light that blinds us.",

Now get out - this is a private yard.\nPlayer: I suspect she mistreats the dog and you, boy. Is this true?\nOyster Boy Dringo: It's not just Scratch. She's always hurting the dogs.\nAngry Mar'hyah: Shut your mouth, Dringo. Last warning.\nPlayer: You have lost your way, hound-keeper.

Curious.\nHavkelaag: Tell me, then, philosopher - if patience delays the fostering of the other virtues, can it be rightly called virtuous?\nPlayer: By your words, any virtue delaying patience would itself be unvirtuous.\nHavkelaag: And therein lies your fault: you would have us argue in circles until the egg hatches naturally. Time we do not have.\nHavkelaag: My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: Sounds pointless. Public opinion will hardly be swayed by such a small experiment.\nHavkelaag: Not at first. But if the experiment proves successful, it must be repeated. Only then will we know if the findings are to be trusted.\nHavkelaag: Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg?

The githyanki have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months.\nHavkelaag: You are no doubt aware that citizens of the Underdark are held in great suspicion by those who live above ground. Many believe us to be 'evil'.\nHavkelaag: The githyanki face similar prejudice, but I believe, if hatched in a less violent, more intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome its evil predispositions.\nHavkelaag: I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: You're letting your personal biases affect your method. Why assume they're evil?\nHavkelaag: I assume nothing. Innate githyanki cruelty is an established fact - no doubt you witnessed it yourself in the retrieval of the egg itself.\nHavkelaag: When I have a suitable sample for my study, I will, however, prove that the effects of their biological inclination are reversible.\nHavkelaag: Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach:\nHavkelaag: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue.\nHavkelaag: Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: That kind of indoctrination and time-forced nurture violates the natural order. It invalidates the whole experiment.\nHavkelaag: I won't bother to argue with you. An arboreal shaman can't be expected to understand the rigorous protocols of theoretical research.\nHavkelaag: My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: And what if your experiment fails?\nHavkelaag: If the child remains evil after the experiment is concluded, it will be destroyed. Such is the fate of all used specimens.\nHavkelaag: Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg? ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: A gith hatchling is not a lab rat! This shka'keth should be bled dry for the mere suggestion.\nPlayer: Sell the egg.",

Nothing like a brush with destruction to make one appreciate the majesty of the celestial canvas.\nGale: It's a view I would once have shared with my companion. Though definitely unaccompanied by such revelry.\nGale: She preferred it when we were alone, curled up before a crackling hearth with some ancient, esoteric tome between us, ink glinting in the firelight...\nPlayer: Sounds, er, fun.\nGale: Not everyone is comfortable being alone with their thoughts. Though I never felt alone with a book in my hand. Or with her for company.\nGale: I speak of Tara, my tressym, assistant, my constant companion through all the ills and tribulations my hubris has thrust upon me.\nGale: She'd be most impressed by our efforts saving these tieflings. Proud, even. And I've given her little to be proud of recently.\nGale: After I was afflicted with my condition, I locked myself in my tower for an entire year. I was inconsolable, wallowing in my self-inflicted tragedy.\nGale: I'd given up on myself, but Tara never did. It was her encouragement, her research that led me to my treatment. Once we knew that magically-infused items were the key, she went out to find them for me. She saved my life.\nGale: After so long being cared for by someone else, it feels good to have repaid the favour. Not directly to Tara, but to these poor tieflings. I'm sure she would approve.\nPlayer: What is Tara like?\nGale: 'Smart' does her a disservice. She's a fine wizard in her own right, though somewhat held back by her lack of opposable thumbs.\nGale: You remind me of her somewhat. An expression you both share - when she gives in to her more feline qualities, a mouse trapped beneath her paw...\nGale: I wish she were here for me to make a formal introduction, but I would never ask her to undertake such a journey. She is safer at home.\nGale: Besides, she was always telling me I needed to spread my wings, so to speak. Find mortal friends, instead of hanging onto Mystra's coattails. So that's what I'm doing. I hope.\nPlayer: So I remind you of your pet? How romantic...\nGale: I assure you, were you to meet Tara you would see the comparison for the flattery it is. But perhaps that's not a point worth labouring further.\nGale: Suffice it to say, I think rather a lot of you. And there aren't many on this plane who I'd give such high praise.\nPlayer: Being mentioned in the same breath as your pet isn't the compliment you think it is...\nGale: Then let me say it more plainly -\nGale: I think you're rather wonderful. And that's not a word I waste on anyone unworthy of it.\nPlayer: The feeling's mutual - you're a wonderful friend. Though usually more... erudite.",

    "conversation": "Halsin: Nature's blessings. Are you ready to do what is necessary?\nPlayer: Tell me what you know about Moonrise Towers.\nHalsin: Travelling to Moonrise is no small task. Expect dangers like you've never seen before.\nPlayer: I'm something of an expert when it comes to imperilling myself.\nHalsin: This is different. There's more fingers on a hand than there are survivors of that place.\nPlayer: What's so dangerous about it?\nHalsin: To get to the Towers, you'll need to pass through a terrible place - a cursed place.\nHalsin: This curse shrouds everything in shadow - you will not find life, light, or anything natural there.\nHalsin: Any who linger are twisted by the curse; they become shadow beings - tormented, dangerous souls.\nPlayer: The Absolute's forces can tolerate such a place?\nHalsin: So it seems, though I don't know how. You will have to choose your approach carefully.\nHalsin: You could go overland - along the Risen Road or through the mountains. Easier at first, but you'll run into the shadow curse eventually.\nHalsin: You could also go under. There is a tunnel somewhere in this very temple of Sel√ªne. It leads to Moonrise Towers through the Underdark.\nHalsin: Long ago, a man called Ketheric Thorm built a secret stronghold deep down there, before rallying a whole army of Dark Justiciars - Shar worshippers.\nShadowheart: Sounds rather ingenious.\nHalsin: Aradin and his lot were looking for a way down there - they were promised riches if they retrieved a relic called the Nightsong. But I think there's more.\nHalsin: From this stronghold, Ketheric's forces could access both the temple of Sel√ªne and Moonrise Towers - but he was defeated before he could launch an attack.\nHalsin: If you can find this place, I'll wager it will reveal a more direct path to Moonrise Towers, and may bypass the worst of the shadow curse.\nPlayer: I already found the place you're talking about - it's called Grymforge.\nHalsin: You've already been? Impressive. You'll make me redundant at this rate. What did you find?\nPlayer: Absolute followers - but that's about all.\nHalsin: Keep looking. If they're present, then it's likely there's a route to Moonrise somewhere.\nHalsin: It may prove impossible to avoid the shadow curse entirely, but if you find any way to limit your exposure, seize it.\nHalsin: You may reconsider once you see the effects of the curse for yourself.\nPlayer: I may live to regret this - or maybe I won't - but fine, I'll help you save the grove first.\nHalsin: You will? Oak Father bless you. I'll be in your debt twice over if we succeed.\nHalsin: You know what's needed - the deaths of Dror Ragzlin, the drow Minthara, and the priestess, Gut. May nature guide you.\nHalsin: I could come and help you... but be warned - I won't be able to suppress my animal side. Subtlety will not be an option.\nHalsin: If I join you, we'll likely have to slaughter this entire place. You may want to use discretion when approaching the goblin leaders.\nPlayer: Come with me.\nHalsin: So be it. May Silvanus lend us nature's fury.",

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon‚Äôs voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar.\nMalus Thorm: See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy.\nMalus Thorm: Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human‚Äôs belly, but it‚Äôs a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace.\nMalus Thorm: Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver.\nMalus Thorm: Come. Step forward. You are no sister, but that matters none. Every student is welcome.\nPlayer: You will stop this sick spectacle at once.\nMalus Thorm: Sick. Quite. But on the cusp of a cure:\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly.\nMalus Thorm: It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nGale: Gods, what living nightmare is this?\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being?\nMalus Thorm: If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: But you: look how the succour of Shar eludes you. See how painfully present you remain...\nMalus Thorm: We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: Your subject is tainted. Shar's succour must only be granted to the willing.\nMalus Thorm: Hmmm. 'Only the willing may know the Lady's embrace.' You know her teachings well.\nMalus Thorm: And yet, these sisters must exercise their gifts, for the art of absence lies in its execution.\nMalus Thorm: How to proceed, I wonder.\nPlayer: Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\nMalus Thorm: Yes... For are we not all in need of a cure?\nMalus Thorm: The scalpel does not discriminate. Let each and every one of you partake in its soothing journey.\nMalus Thorm: Absence, sisters. Acquaint yourselves.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) Screaming and slashing, the sisters brutally murder each other.\nMalus Thorm: It is a proud moment when one sees one's teachings so lovingly taken to heart.\nMalus Thorm: You are to be commended for their graduation - rewarded with the promised cure.\nMalus Thorm: Come, I will acquaint you with the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nPlayer: My magic has blinded me - I see now that Shar is the only path. Show me how - I beg of you.\nPlayer: I would rather acquaint myself - if you show me how.\nMalus Thorm: Your diligence is exemplary. Very well: your own scalpel you will be.",

And I've given her precious little to be proud of recently.\nGale: She has a good heart, and she would recognise the same in your actions here. I'm sure she'd approve of me lending myself to your efforts.\nGale: After so long being cared for by someone else, it feels good to have repaid the favour.

You share her pragmatic streak.\nGale: I wish she were here for me to make a formal introduction, but I would never ask her to undertake such a journey.

You might need to catch me up a bit...\nGale: Karsus - I believe I mentioned him before. The child-who-would-become-a-god.

That's a lesson I've only recently learned.\nGale: I worshipped Mystra loyally for years, and in that time she granted me the barest sliver of the power I was ready to wield.\nGale: Even with the fate of the world at stake, she had little more to offer me than the means of blowing myself up at a more convenient time. She's done nothing to help us.\nGale: Mystra wanted the brain obliterated because of this crown. She fears a world in which such power is beyond her control - ready to be claimed by Karsus' successor.\nPlayer: I thought you were past this kind of temptation, Gale. You know exactly where such over-reaching leads.\nGale: Neither of us can know what truly may be if we don't at least try. Potential is nothing in itself - just a fleeting dream, unless we drag it into the waking world. Please, at least think on it.\nGale: Powerful as he was, Karsus lacked some advantages I can lay claim to.\nGale: I know Mystra - intimately. And I carry a fragment of the Weave itself within my body. Karsus achieved many things, but he never managed that.\nGale: A long road lies ahead before the Crown comes into our possession. All I ask for now is that you not dismiss this possibility out of hand. Please - at least think on it.\nPlayer: Mystra is no friend of the Dark Lady. If you can dethrone her, you have my support.",

She's a tressym. And given your confusion, I'm guessing you've never met one.

And I've given her precious little to be proud of recently.\nGale: She has a good heart, and she would recognise the same in your actions here.

She's a fine wizard in her own right, though somewhat held back by her lack of opposable thumbs.\nGale: You remind me of her somewhat. There's a steeliness to you, an unwavering tenacity even in the face of, to be frank, quite dire odds.\nGale: I wish she were here for me to make a formal introduction, but I would never ask her to undertake such a journey.

Those are precious indeed.\nGale: I hope, though we've only known each other for a short time, I might be able to count you among that number?\nPlayer: Friends with the mighty Gale of Waterdeep?

The great flying cities of Netheril plunged from the sky. Karsus' Folly.\nGale: That goddess of magic was reborn as Mystra.

Some favour, some stir of courage, some response?\nGale: I worshipped Mystra loyally for years, and in that time she granted me the barest sliver of the power I was ready to wield.\nGale: Even with the fate of the world at stake, she had little more to offer me than the means of blowing myself up at a more convenient time. She's done nothing to help us.\nGale: Mystra wanted the brain obliterated because of this crown. She fears a world in which such power is beyond her control - ready to be claimed by Karsus' successor.\nPlayer: Or to destroy the next wizard who attempts it. The attempt would kill you as it killed Karsus.\nGale: Do you think I had not considered that? I have no intention of repeating his folly.\nGale: Powerful as he was, Karsus lacked some advantages I can lay claim to.\nGale: I know Mystra - intimately. And I carry a fragment of the Weave itself within my body. Karsus achieved many things, but he never managed that.\nGale: A long road lies ahead before the Crown comes into our possession. All I ask for now is that you not dismiss this possibility out of hand. Please - at least think on it.\nPlayer: You're a convincing man, Gale. The crown sounds promising.",

I was hoping to speak to you - I confess, my thoughts have been somewhat scattered since my audience with Mystra.\nGale: The Karsite Weave could offer more than just power - it could bestow divinity. If I only trust myself to wield it.\nGale: The power to change the world - it may be within our reach. You must have an opinion, surely.\nPlayer: I don't know what to say. How can I respond to something so... immense? It's beyond comprehension.\nGale: Then the fault lies with me, and my inadequate words. Please, allow me to show you instead. Just close your eyes a moment.\nGale: Words alone are not enough. Permit me to show you. Please, close your eyes a moment.\nPlayer: Close your eyes.\nGale: Astra navigabimus.\nNodeContext: Latin spellcasting - ass-tra navi-gah-mus ('we sail the stars')\nGale: Few mortals ever glimpse what you're about to see. But don't be alarmed - I'm here with you. Now... open your eyes.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Fade up from black as the player opens their eyes to a dazzling spectacle. They and Gale are now sitting in a small boat that shimmers with iridescent light. Unpiloted, it silently meanders through a majestic, infinite starfield.\nGale: The Outer Planes. This is where gods dwell. Where they observe us from afar. Where they make play-things of us.\nGale: They would keep all of this from us - the power, the possibilities. They only want us to serve them, pray to them... and ultimately, die for them.\nGale: But what if we didn't need them? What if we wielded their power instead, and helped ourselves in all the ways they refuse to. I could make that happen. I could make this illusion a reality, with you by my side.\nPlayer: You know how I feel. I've already voiced my support.\nGale: Yes, you have. But I want more than your support. I want your heart.\nGale: The tadpoles, the orb - these threats to our existence - the gods could aid us if they wished, but instead they cower behind Ao. So let us act ourselves.\nNodeContext: Ao = AY-oh (an overlord deity that most gods answer to)\nGale: With the power of the crown, any foe would be rendered impotent. Any obstacle would be dwarfed by our might.\nGale: I used to believe Mystra's forgiveness was worth dying for. But I was wrong. You showed me just how much I have to live for.\nGale: With you, I forget my goddess. I love you.\nGale: Tell me you feel the same way. Tell me you want what I want. Please.\nPlayer: This sounds dangerous.\nGale: No doubt it will be - abominably so. As is just about everything we do. But I know we're up to the task. What do you say...?\nGale: You mean... you want the same as I do?\nNodeContext: Hope rising again\nPlayer: I can't, Gale. This is best forgotten. I love you as you are.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Gale's shoulders sag. The starfield around seems to dim. Distant points of light vanish into the infinite dark.\nGale: What more is there to be said?\nPlayer: Plenty, in time. This doesn't have to be the end for us - just forget the crown.\nGale: But I could be so much more to you.\nNodeContext: crestfallen\nPlayer: Say nothing. Answer him with a kiss instead.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: The player and Gale lean in to kiss while seated facing each other.\nGale: You see me as I am, and do not find me wanting. With these stars as my witness, I swear - you will always be enough for me.",

The art of conversation. The art of taste, time honoured and newly acquired.\nGale: The art of the body. The exploration and acceptance of the self and the other. The art of the night itself.\nGale: I say we take a page from their book.\nPlayer: You're remarkably upfront about your intentions.\nGale: I'm many things, but coy's not one of them.\nGale: What do you say?\nPlayer: I'm not sure you're the one I want.\nGale: That's because you've yet to find out what you're missing.\nGale: Doubt is a spoilsport.

Proud, even. And I've given her little to be proud of recently.\nGale: After I was afflicted with my condition, I locked myself in my tower for an entire year.

I'm sure she would approve.\nPlayer: She must be very smart, to have done all that.\nGale: 'Smart' does her a disservice. She's a fine wizard in her own right, though somewhat held back by her lack of opposable thumbs.\nGale: You remind me of her somewhat. There's a steeliness to you, an unwavering tenacity even in the face of, to be frank, quite dire odds.\nGale: I wish she were here for me to make a formal introduction, but I would never ask her to undertake such a journey. She is safer at home.\nGale: Besides, she was always telling me I needed to spread my wings, so to speak. Find mortal friends, instead of hanging onto Mystra's coattails. So that's what I'm doing. I hope.\nPlayer: What if she doesn't like me?\nGale: She'll love you. So long as you don't rub her belly. She hates it when anyone does that.\nPlayer: Not as much as I hate talking about cats. Is there nothing else on your mind?\nGale: Not an animal lover? Nobody's perfect, I suppose.\nGale: Nonetheless, your finer qualities are remarkably plentiful.\nGale: Suffice it to say, I think rather a lot of you. And there aren't many on this plane who I'd give such high praise.\nPlayer: Being mentioned in the same breath as your pet isn't the compliment you think it is...\nGale: Then let me say it more plainly -\nGale: I think you're rather wonderful.

Though definitely unaccompanied by such revelry.\nGale: She preferred it when we were alone, curled up before a crackling hearth with some ancient, esoteric tome between us, ink glinting in the firelight...\nPlayer: Are you... are you talking about your cat?\nGale: By Ahghairon's lost nose - no!\nGale: Tara is not any cat. She's a tressym. And given your confusion, I'm guessing you've never met one. They're brilliant creatures - fine company for any self-respecting wizard.\nGale: I speak of Tara, my tressym, assistant, my constant companion through all the ills and tribulations my hubris has thrust upon me.\nGale: She'd be most impressed by our efforts saving these tieflings. Proud, even. And I've given her little to be proud of recently.\nGale: After I was afflicted with my condition, I locked myself in my tower for an entire year. I was inconsolable, wallowing in my self-inflicted tragedy.\nGale: I'd given up on myself, but Tara never did. It was her encouragement, her research that led me to my treatment. Once we knew that magically-infused items were the key, she went out to find them for me. She saved my life.\nGale: After so long being cared for by someone else, it feels good to have repaid the favour. Not directly to Tara, but to these poor tieflings. I'm sure she would approve.\nPlayer: She must be very smart, to have done all that.\nGale: 'Smart' does her a disservice. She's a fine wizard in her own right, though somewhat held back by her lack of opposable thumbs.\nGale: You remind me of her somewhat. There's a steeliness to you, an unwavering tenacity even in the face of, to be frank, quite dire odds.\nGale: I wish she were here for me to make a formal introduction, but I would never ask her to undertake such a journey. She is safer at home.\nGale: Besides, she was always telling me I needed to spread my wings, so to speak. Find mortal friends, instead of hanging onto Mystra's coattails. So that's what I'm doing. I hope.\nPlayer: Friends with the mighty Gale of Waterdeep? I'd be honoured.\nGale: I'm glad. To know you enjoy my company is, well, it's rather wonderful actually. I'd be loathe to waste the time of someone who's become rather important to me.\nGale: I think you're rather wonderful. And that's not a word I waste on anyone unworthy of it.\nPlayer: Don't stop now. What else do you like about me?\nGale: Were I to recite that list, I fear we'd still be here at dusk tomorrow.
