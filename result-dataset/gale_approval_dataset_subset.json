Our friends, our adventures... this would have been so much easier if it was just me. But it isn't.\nGale: If there is a way - any way - to save all that's grown dear to me, I want to seize it.

Is this starry sky your doing?\nGale: Indeed. The curse is still present of course - just veiled and at arm's length for now. Not a trick I can repeat often, but tonight? Tonight is different.\nGale: This may be my last night alive. I wanted it to be under a canopy of beauty and wonder...\nGale: ...and with company to match.\nNodeContext: Full of longing\nGale: I thought this place might bring me peace. I thought it might make the weight of what I must do feel a little lighter... but I am not so sure.\nPlayer: Is this truly what you want, to die for the promise of Mystra's forgiveness?\nGale: Babe or crone, coward or hero, death is assured. Mystra's forgiveness is not. If you knew the end was near, would you not want to ensure it had meaning?\nGale: I am terrified - I will not claim otherwise. My face could scarcely conceal it even if my words sought to deny it.\nGale: There is no point in running from the inevitable. Better to meet it, on my own terms.\nPlayer: Nothing is inevitable. Not when we face it together. You don't have to die.\nPlayer: I'm not going anywhere, Gale. I'll be by your side, whatever dawn brings.\nGale: Yes... but there is so much to live for, and so few moments in which to house it all.\nGale: Damn you. Damn you for giving me so much to care about. Our friends, our adventures... this would have been so much easier if it was just me. But it isn't.\nGale: If there is a way - any way - to save all that's grown dear to me, I want to seize it. I just can't fathom what that might be, other than to fail Mystra and condemn the world.\nGale: Stay with me, will you? I don't want to think of it any more, but I don't want to be alone either.\nPlayer: I'd rather not listen to you wallowing in self-pity. Good night, Gale.",

Would you like me to show you?\nGale: Would you like to experience this?\nPlayer: Yes, I would.\nGale: Then follow my lead.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: ~Gale walks around behind the player (as though teaching them to fly a kite) and makes a delicate gesture with both hands.\nGale: Now you.\nPlayer: Imitate the gesture with ease.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: ~The player imitates the gesture. There’s a first visual effect. Some sparks of magic start to appear around the player and Gale.\nNarrator: *A familiar feeling - like a kind word and a kind touch at the same time. It's warm and comfortable.*\nGale: Excellent. Now repeat after me: Ah-Thran Mystra-Ryl Kantrach-Ao.\nPlayer: An easy incantation. Simply repeat after Gale.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: The visual effect intensifies. There’s the start of a glow, of a rush of beautiful magic.\nNarrator: *Ah, yes: the scent of rosewater and a sense of wellbeing. A sliver of Weave that tastes sweet on the tongue.*\nGale: Very good. Now I want you to picture in your mind the concept of harmony. As true as you can.\nPlayer: Recede into the calm centre of your mind, just like you were taught at the academy.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: ~The player and Gale are now fully enveloped in a magic glow - a protective field of beautiful magic. Unconsciously player steps back closer to Gale.\nNarrator: *You see - or is it sense? - the unmistakable presence of Mystra, the Lady of Mysteries.*\nNarrator: *There's something like the anticipation of a kiss, then the pleasure of being cloaked in peace.*\nNarrator: *You are safe. You are nestled in the cup of Mystra's hand.*\nGale: Look at that. We're channelling the Weave. How does it feel?\nGale: You did it. You're channelling the Weave. How does it feel?\nPlayer: Effortless. You're a wonderful teacher.\nGale: I know.\nNarrator: *The Weave connects you. The moment feels intimate.*\nPlayer: Hold on to the moment. It's a good night for intimacy.\nNarrator: *You realise the Weave is making you one. You have but to imagine your desire, and Gale will know it.*\nPlayer: Picture kicking him in the gut.",

Yes, I want it.\nAraj Oblodra: I'll even compensate you - a potion of legendary power that forever increases the strength of the one who consumes it.\nAraj Oblodra: It's not for sale, but it's yours if you bite me.\nAstarion: I will have to decline.\nAraj Oblodra: Excuse me? This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and you're squandering it.\nAstarion: I gave you my answer.\nAraj Oblodra: Can't you talk some sense into your obstinate charge?\nPlayer: I am surprised, Astarion. I thought you'd jump at a chance like this.\nAstarion: I'm sorry, but could you excuse us a moment?\nAstarion: Are you actually asking me to do this? Trading me for some potion?\nAstarion: Because there's something wrong with her blood. I can smell it from here - it's rank.\nPlayer: What do you mean? What's wrong with her blood?\nAstarion: I can't say, it just smells wrong. Unnatural.\nAstarion: Drinking it wouldn't kill me, but it would not be pleasant.\nAraj Oblodra: I don't have all day, True Soul.\nPlayer: Don't do anything you don't want to.\nAstarion: All right.

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon’s voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar.\nMalus Thorm: See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy.\nMalus Thorm: Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace.\nMalus Thorm: Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver.\nMalus Thorm: Come. Step forward. You are no sister, but that matters none. Every student is welcome.\nPlayer: I don't wish to study, only to lift the curse on this land.\nMalus Thorm: A curse? Nay, a cure that leads to the very pinnacle of being:\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly.\nMalus Thorm: It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nLae'zel: Only a beast of a man toys with his victim. Entertaining, if not efficient.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being?\nMalus Thorm: If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: You are well on your way. But one white orb disfigures you still. Let us finish the cure.\nMalus Thorm: We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: Your subject is tainted. Shar's succour must only be granted to the willing.\nMalus Thorm: Hmmm. 'Only the willing may know the Lady's embrace.' You know her teachings well.\nMalus Thorm: And yet, these sisters must exercise their gifts, for the art of absence lies in its execution.\nMalus Thorm: How to proceed, I wonder.\nPlayer: The sisters require a willing volunteer, a master of the art.\n: True\nMalus Thorm: I see now. By example I must edify and quell the light that blinds us.",

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon’s voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar.\nMalus Thorm: See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy.\nMalus Thorm: Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace.\nMalus Thorm: Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver.\nMalus Thorm: Come. Step forward. You are no sister, but that matters none. Every student is welcome.\nPlayer: I don't wish to study, only to lift the curse on this land.\nMalus Thorm: A curse? Nay, a cure that leads to the very pinnacle of being:\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly.\nMalus Thorm: It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nLae'zel: Only a beast of a man toys with his victim. Entertaining, if not efficient.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being?\nMalus Thorm: If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: You are well on your way. But one white orb disfigures you still. Let us finish the cure.\nMalus Thorm: We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: Your subject is tainted. Shar's succour must only be granted to the willing.\nMalus Thorm: Hmmm. 'Only the willing may know the Lady's embrace.' You know her teachings well.\nMalus Thorm: And yet, these sisters must exercise their gifts, for the art of absence lies in its execution.\nMalus Thorm: How to proceed, I wonder.\nPlayer: Practice - that's how I got good with a blade. They should spar each other.\nPlayer: Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\n: True\nMalus Thorm: Yes... For are we not all in need of a cure?\nMalus Thorm: The scalpel does not discriminate. Let each and every one of you partake in its soothing journey.\nMalus Thorm: Absence, sisters. Acquaint yourselves.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) Screaming and slashing, the sisters brutally murder each other.\nMalus Thorm: It is a proud moment when one sees one's teachings so lovingly taken to heart.\nMalus Thorm: You are to be commended for their graduation - rewarded with the promised cure.\nMalus Thorm: Come, I will acquaint you with the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nPlayer: I am not worthy! Please, show me how a master works - I would be honoured.\nPlayer: I would rather acquaint myself - if you show me how.\n: True\nMalus Thorm: Your diligence is exemplary.

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon’s voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar.\nMalus Thorm: See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy.\nMalus Thorm: Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace.\nMalus Thorm: Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver.\nMalus Thorm: Come. Step forward. You are no sister, but that matters none. Every student is welcome.\nPlayer: I don't wish to study, only to lift the curse on this land.\nMalus Thorm: A curse? Nay, a cure that leads to the very pinnacle of being:\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly.\nMalus Thorm: It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nLae'zel: Only a beast of a man toys with his victim. Entertaining, if not efficient.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being?\nMalus Thorm: If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: You are well on your way. But one white orb disfigures you still. Let us finish the cure.\nMalus Thorm: We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: Your subject is tainted. Shar's succour must only be granted to the willing.\nMalus Thorm: Hmmm. 'Only the willing may know the Lady's embrace.' You know her teachings well.\nMalus Thorm: And yet, these sisters must exercise their gifts, for the art of absence lies in its execution.\nMalus Thorm: How to proceed, I wonder.\nPlayer: Sparring is vital to progress. Have them practice on each other.\nPlayer: Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\n: True\nMalus Thorm: Yes... For are we not all in need of a cure?\nMalus Thorm: The scalpel does not discriminate. Let each and every one of you partake in its soothing journey.\nMalus Thorm: Absence, sisters. Acquaint yourselves.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) Screaming and slashing, the sisters brutally murder each other.\nMalus Thorm: It is a proud moment when one sees one's teachings so lovingly taken to heart.\nMalus Thorm: You are to be commended for their graduation - rewarded with the promised cure.\nMalus Thorm: Come, I will acquaint you with the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nPlayer: I sought purpose in the natural world - I see now that Shar is the only path. Show me how - I beg of you.\nPlayer: I would rather acquaint myself - if you show me how.\n: True\nMalus Thorm: Your diligence is exemplary. Very well: your own scalpel you will be.",

I allowed myself to get carried away, and failed to properly explain myself.\nPlayer: Apology accepted.\nGale: Thank you. But I owe you more than that. I need to help you understand just what this could mean for us.\nGale: Words alone are not enough. Permit me to show you.

They only want us to serve them, pray to them... and ultimately, die for them.\nGale: But what if we didn't need them? What if we wielded their power instead, and helped ourselves in all the ways they refuse to. I could make that happen. I could make this illusion a reality, with you by my side.\nPlayer: You're still determined to do this, after all that was said?\nGale: How could I not crave this? But I don't want it for myself, alone - I want you at my side, willing and wholehearted.\nGale: The tadpoles, the orb - these threats to our existence - the gods could aid us if they wished, but instead they cower behind Ao. So let us act ourselves.\nNodeContext: Ao = AY-oh (an overlord deity that most gods answer to)\nGale: With the power of the crown, any foe would be rendered impotent. Any obstacle would be dwarfed by our might.\nGale: I used to believe Mystra's forgiveness was worth dying for. But I was wrong. You showed me just how much I have to live for.\nGale: With you, I forget my goddess. I love you.\nGale: Tell me you feel the same way. Tell me you want what I want. Please.\nPlayer: I feel the same. Whatever you need of me, consider it done.\nGale: Right now, I need nothing more than a kiss. Then we'll face what is to come, together. And claim the crown when the time comes.\nPlayer: Wait. Perhaps I'm being too hasty... and perhaps you're overreaching.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Gale's shoulders sag. The starfield around seems to dim. Distant points of light vanish into the infinite dark.\nGale: What more is there to be said?\nPlayer: Plenty, in time. This doesn't have to be the end for us - just forget the crown.\nGale: But I could be so much more to you.\nNodeContext: crestfallen\nPlayer: You're already everything I need you to be.\nGale: I hope you're right.

I'll be by your side, whatever dawn brings.\nGale: One moment with you could sate me for a lifetime, and prise the fear from my heart. I'm so very glad you came, to share this with me.\nGale: I know this is all unreal, but I created it for you. You must know that you're... That you're very special to me.\nGale: If things were different, if we were home, I'd have taken the time to do things properly. To say it all better.

Is this starry sky your doing?\nGale: Indeed. The curse is still present of course - just veiled and at arm's length for now. Not a trick I can repeat often, but tonight? Tonight is different.\nGale: This may be my last night alive. I wanted it to be under a canopy of beauty and wonder...\nGale: ...and with company to match.\nNodeContext: Full of longing\nGale: I thought this place might bring me peace. I thought it might make the weight of what I must do feel a little lighter... but I am not so sure.\nPlayer: Is this truly what you want, to die for the promise of Mystra's forgiveness?\nGale: Babe or crone, coward or hero, death is assured. Mystra's forgiveness is not. If you knew the end was near, would you not want to ensure it had meaning?\nGale: I am terrified - I will not claim otherwise. My face could scarcely conceal it even if my words sought to deny it.\nGale: There is no point in running from the inevitable. Better to meet it, on my own terms.\nPlayer: Nothing is inevitable. Not when we face it together. You don't have to die.\nPlayer: I'm not going anywhere, Gale. I'll be by your side, whatever dawn brings.\nGale: One moment with you could sate me for a lifetime, and prise the fear from my heart. I'm so very glad you came, to share this with me.\nGale: I know this is all unreal, but I created it for you. You must know that you're... That you're very special to me.\nGale: If things were different, if we were home, I'd have taken the time to do things properly. To say it all better. But time is short.\nGale: I'm in love with you.\nPlayer: Lean in for a kiss.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: The player and Gale kiss seated on the ground. It's relatively chaste.\nPlayer: You're out of practice.\nGale: A fair assessment - I wish we had more time to practice together.\nGale: I want it to be perfect - to bond with you in the way that gods do... intertwining our spirits in visions of the Weave.\nPlayer: I don't need illusions. I want the Gale standing right in front of me.\nGale: Are you sure...? I could conjure up any sight that you could dream of, and a few you could not. I could use the Weave to make us feel sensations beyond reckoning. I could do more than woo you. I could wow you.\nPlayer: You don't need to impress me, Gale. I'm no deity.",

Now I want you to picture in your mind the concept of harmony. As true as you can.\nPlayer: Recede into the calm centre of your mind, just like you were taught at the academy.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: ~The player and Gale are now fully enveloped in a magic glow - a protective field of beautiful magic.

The player approaches Gale and sits down next to him.\nGale: I love this time of night.\nNodeContext: Wistful\nGale: There's an almost reverent silence that accompanies the peak of darkness, when you'd almost believe the dawn will never break.\nGale: The cradle of eternity.\nGale: The timelessness of lovers.\nGale: That most beautiful of fantasies.\nPlayer: It's breathtaking, Gale. Is this starry sky your doing?\nGale: Indeed. The curse is still present of course - just veiled and at arm's length for now. Not a trick I can repeat often, but tonight? Tonight is different.\nGale: This may be my last night alive. I wanted it to be under a canopy of beauty and wonder...\nGale: ...and with company to match.\nNodeContext: Full of longing\nGale: I thought this place might bring me peace. I thought it might make the weight of what I must do feel a little lighter... but I am not so sure.\nPlayer: Is this truly what you want, to die for the promise of Mystra's forgiveness?\nGale: Babe or crone, coward or hero, death is assured. Mystra's forgiveness is not. If you knew the end was near, would you not want to ensure it had meaning?\nGale: I am terrified - I will not claim otherwise. My face could scarcely conceal it even if my words sought to deny it.\nGale: There is no point in running from the inevitable. Better to meet it, on my own terms.\nPlayer: Nothing is inevitable. Not when we face it together. You don't have to die.\nPlayer: I'm not going anywhere, Gale. I'll be by your side, whatever dawn brings.\nGale: One moment with you could sate me for a lifetime, and prise the fear from my heart. I'm so very glad you came, to share this with me.\nGale: I know this is all unreal, but I created it for you. You must know that you're... That you're very special to me.\nGale: If things were different, if we were home, I'd have taken the time to do things properly. To say it all better. But time is short.\nGale: I'm in love with you.\nPlayer: Lean in for a kiss.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: The player and Gale kiss seated on the ground. It's relatively chaste.\nPlayer: I hope that wasn't a parting kiss.\nGale: Not if I have any say in the matter.\nGale: I want it to be perfect - to bond with you in the way that gods do... intertwining our spirits in visions of the Weave.\nPlayer: I don't need illusions. I want the Gale standing right in front of me.\nGale: Are you sure...? I could conjure up any sight that you could dream of, and a few you could not. I could use the Weave to make us feel sensations beyond reckoning. I could do more than woo you. I could wow you.\nPlayer: You don't need to impress me, Gale. I'm no deity.",

What would that entail?\nGale: We shared a romantic moment of the mind while cloaked in the Weave, didn't we?\nGale: And I seem to recall a fond allusion to that moment afterwards.\nGale: Allow me to make the following proposition:\nGale: There's a book that circulates in Amn, detailing the first thousand nights of a newlywed king and queen.\nGale: They turned everything they did into an art. The art of conversation. The art of taste, time honoured and newly acquired.\nGale: The art of the body. The exploration and acceptance of the self and the other. The art of the night itself.\nGale: I say we take a page from their book.\nPlayer: You're remarkably upfront about your intentions.\nGale: I'm many things, but coy's not one of them.\nGale: What do you say?\nPlayer: I'm not sure you're the one I want.\nGale: That's because you've yet to find out what you're missing.\nGale: Doubt is a spoilsport.

They only want us to serve them, pray to them... and ultimately, die for them.\nGale: But what if we didn't need them? What if we wielded their power instead, and helped ourselves in all the ways they refuse to. I could make that happen. I could make this illusion a reality, with you by my side.\nPlayer: You're still determined to do this, after all that was said?\nGale: How could I not crave this? But I don't want it for myself, alone - I want you at my side, willing and wholehearted.\nGale: The tadpoles, the orb - these threats to our existence - the gods could aid us if they wished, but instead they cower behind Ao. So let us act ourselves.\nNodeContext: Ao = AY-oh (an overlord deity that most gods answer to)\nGale: With the power of the crown, any foe would be rendered impotent. Any obstacle would be dwarfed by our might.\nGale: I used to believe Mystra's forgiveness was worth dying for. But I was wrong. You showed me just how much I have to live for.\nGale: With you, I forget my goddess. I love you.\nGale: Tell me you feel the same way. Tell me you want what I want. Please.\nPlayer: I feel the same. Whatever you need of me, consider it done.\nGale: Right now, I need nothing more than a kiss. Then we'll face what is to come, together. And claim the crown when the time comes.\nPlayer: Let's not grow complacent - that path you speak of is sure to be a dangerous one.\nGale: No doubt it will be - abominably so. As is just about everything we do. But I know we're up to the task. Are you still with me?\nGale: You mean... you want the same as I do?\nNodeContext: Hope rising again\nPlayer: Yes. I want you to seize the crown, and make us a new world.\nGale: Then it will be so. With you and I together, there's not a force in existence that can stop us.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: The player and Gale lean in to kiss while seated facing each other.\nGale: You see me as I am, and do not find me wanting.

They and Gale are now sitting in a small boat that shimmers with iridescent light. Unpiloted, it silently meanders through a majestic, infinite starfield.\nGale: The Outer Planes. This is where gods dwell. Where they observe us from afar. Where they make play-things of us.\nGale: They would keep all of this from us - the power, the possibilities. They only want us to serve them, pray to them... and ultimately, die for them.\nGale: But what if we didn't need them? What if we wielded their power instead, and helped ourselves in all the ways they refuse to. I could make that happen. I could make this illusion a reality, with you by my side.\nPlayer: You're still determined to do this, after all that was said?\nGale: How could I not crave this? But I don't want it for myself, alone - I want you at my side, willing and wholehearted.\nGale: The tadpoles, the orb - these threats to our existence - the gods could aid us if they wished, but instead they cower behind Ao. So let us act ourselves.\nNodeContext: Ao = AY-oh (an overlord deity that most gods answer to)\nGale: With the power of the crown, any foe would be rendered impotent. Any obstacle would be dwarfed by our might.\nGale: I used to believe Mystra's forgiveness was worth dying for. But I was wrong. You showed me just how much I have to live for.\nGale: With you, I forget my goddess. I love you.\nGale: Tell me you feel the same way. Tell me you want what I want. Please.\nPlayer: I feel the same. Whatever you need of me, consider it done.\nGale: Right now, I need nothing more than a kiss. Then we'll face what is to come, together. And claim the crown when the time comes.\nPlayer: Kiss him.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: The player and Gale lean in to kiss while seated facing each other.\nGale: You put the stars to shame. Let's sit here another while - I want to drink you in.",

Startled, he dispells it.\nPlayer: Is everything all right?\nGale: Of course, of course. I was just... practising an incantation.\nPlayer: If you say so.\nGale: I do - because it's through practice that I seek to perfect. To augment.\nGale: Magic is... my life. I've been in touch with the Weave for as long as I can remember. There's nothing like it.\nGale: It's like music, poetry, physical beauty all rolled into one and given expression through the senses.\nGale: That is why I asked you to seek me out, to offer you a taste of such wonders. Would you like me to show you?\nGale: Would you like to experience this?\nPlayer: Yes, I would.\nGale: Then follow my lead.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: ~Gale walks around behind the player (as though teaching them to fly a kite) and makes a delicate gesture with both hands.\nGale: Now you.\nPlayer: Imitate the gesture with ease.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: ~The player imitates the gesture. There’s a first visual effect. Some sparks of magic start to appear around the player and Gale.\nNarrator: *A familiar feeling - like a kind word and a kind touch at the same time. It's warm and comfortable.*\nGale: Excellent. Now repeat after me: Ah-Thran Mystra-Ryl Kantrach-Ao.\nPlayer: An easy incantation. Simply repeat after Gale.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: The visual effect intensifies. There’s the start of a glow, of a rush of beautiful magic.\nNarrator: *Ah, yes: the scent of rosewater and a sense of wellbeing. A sliver of Weave that tastes sweet on the tongue.*\nGale: Very good. Now I want you to picture in your mind the concept of harmony. As true as you can.\nPlayer: Recede into the calm centre of your mind, just like you were taught at the academy.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: ~The player and Gale are now fully enveloped in a magic glow - a protective field of beautiful magic. Unconsciously player steps back closer to Gale.\nNarrator: *You see - or is it sense? - the unmistakable presence of Mystra, the Lady of Mysteries.*\nNarrator: *There's something like the anticipation of a kiss, then the pleasure of being cloaked in peace.*\nNarrator: *You are safe. You are nestled in the cup of Mystra's hand.*\nGale: Look at that. We're channelling the Weave. How does it feel?\nGale: You did it. You're channelling the Weave. How does it feel?\nPlayer: Magical. Sensual, even.\nGale: That it does.\nNarrator: *The Weave connects you. The moment feels intimate.*\nPlayer: Hold on to the moment. It's a good night for intimacy.\nNarrator: *You realise the Weave is making you one. You have but to imagine your desire, and Gale will know it.*\nPlayer: Picture kissing him. With tenderness.

It would be a shame to spend my final hours making an ass of myself.\nNodeContext: relieved chuckle\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: The player and Gale kiss seated on the ground. It's relatively chaste.\nPlayer: I hope that wasn't a parting kiss.\nGale: Not if I have any say in the matter.\nGale: I want it to be perfect - to bond with you in the way that gods do... intertwining our spirits in visions of the Weave.\nPlayer: I don't need illusions. I want the Gale standing right in front of me.\nGale: Are you sure...? I could conjure up any sight that you could dream of, and a few you could not. I could use the Weave to make us feel sensations beyond reckoning. I could do more than woo you. I could wow you.\nPlayer: You don't need to impress me, Gale. I'm no deity.",
