Elturel had no place for tieflings after the Descent.\nNarrator: *You remember it.

I can help.\nZevlor: It's good of you to offer, but there's a whole army of goblins out there.\nZevlor: We'd need an army of our own to escort us safely to Baldur's Gate, and while I don't doubt your abilities... you're no army.\nZevlor: There may be a way though. Goblins are ill-disciplined - it's unlike them to organise so cleverly.\n\nZevlor: Somebody must be leading them, bringing discipline to their ranks. Take out that leadership, and they'll scatter.\nZevlor: The Blade of Frontiers has done what he can to help us prepare for the journey, and we're grateful, but it'll be a short journey if the goblins still own the roads.\nWyll: By the Triad, there is only one correct answer. Refuse him, and we sentence these people to die.\nPlayer: This isn't my problem.",

I've been waiting for someone with any measure of wits to heed my clarion call.\nLorroakan: It's quite simple. Bring the Nightsong here, and collect your reward.\nLorroakan: Good.

I've seen inside your head, thanks to my troops. Besides, if you were an enemy, you'd be completely surrounded.\nPlayer: I'm friendly. Z'rell sent me to make sure you weren't failing your master.\nBalthazar: General Thorm...?\nBalthazar: Rubbish. Everything is at hand here - Z'rell merely envies the General's faith in me. I am in the midst of a grand strategy.\nBalthazar: But you're here now, and I may be able to put those limbs to work. You know what's at stake here, I take it?\nPlayer: Judging by how you're cowering in here, your survival?\nBalthazar: I do not cower - I plan. I command. I create.\nBalthazar: General Thorm trusts me. He knows I will deliver.

I have as many as I care to make.\nPlayer: As you mention serving Ketheric, he sent you to find a relic, no?\nBalthazar: General Thorm to you. But yes, recovering the relic is the crux of it. He commands, and I, his humble servant, fulfil that command.\nBalthazar: While you, an infinitely more humble servant, fulfil my command. I will put you to work - as a scout.\nNarrator: *This necromancer has Ketheric's trust. Helping him could be just what you need to gain access to the man himself.*\nPlayer: As much as I enjoy you flattering me, this isn't my problem.\nPlayer: Keep it - this is your problem, not mine.\nBalthazar: This is not a problem - it is an opportunity.
