It's over.\nWulbren Bongle: Please - if a Gondian told me the sky was blue, I'd look outside and check.\nWulbren Bongle: Toobin will lie, torment, and scheme until his dying breath. Kill him - or the Ironhands will.\nWulbren Bongle: You Gondians will lie, scheme, and torment this city until your dying breaths.

Elturel had no place for tieflings after the Descent.\nNarrator: *You remember it. Elturel and all its citizens were dragged into Avernus - then back out again.*\nPlayer: Let me guess: Your old neighbours called you 'devilkin' and acted like they never knew you.\nZevlor: How easily such a nasty word slips through the mouth of someone you thought you knew.\nZevlor: We thought we'd found sanctuary here, but the druids have determined to turn us out.\nZevlor: We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: This ritual - is there no way to convince the druids to stop it?\nZevlor: I've tried.

He whose immortality I supply with my very soul.\nBalthazar: General. Thorm. I'm sure you'll be on your best behaviour for him. But just in case, I've taken some precautions.\nBalthazar: Keep back. It will take quite some concentration to secure Aylin for her little journey.\nShadowheart: The Nightsong is Shar's sacrifice - she's my destiny. He cannot have her!\nShar: Stop him. Nightsong must not leave. She must die by my spear, or you will have failed me.\nNodeContext: Urgent\nNightwarden Minthara: I stand with you, Shadowheart.
