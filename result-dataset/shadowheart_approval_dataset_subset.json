Before Shar we stand gloriously naked, beyond the vanities of mortals.\nPlayer: How exactly do Shar worshippers turn people to their goddess?\nShadowheart: We tear down the lies the world is drunk on: the institutions they trust, the so-called gods they worship. The lives they cling to. We destroy false idols, topple corrupt organisations, fight heretics wherever they're found. There's often suffering - death even.

That wriggler in your head isn't going to get its damn self out, is it? That wriggler swimming in your brain juice is a bit of an inconvenience, isn't it?\nPlayer: Don't change the subject. Why is that woman really here?\nGROUP_Act1_GLO_HagHuman: I told you - the girl is none of your business. Keep that hole under your nose shut.\nKarlach: I don't like this. What's really going on here?\nGROUP_Act1_GLO_HagHuman: I'll talk about your wriggler - and that's it. Last warning.\nPlayer: Fine. Can you remove the parasite?\nGROUP_Act1_GLO_HagHuman: Quicker than you can say 'Yes, Auntie.' What do you say? Want me to take care of the little bugger?\nPlayer: Depends on the price.\nGROUP_Act1_GLO_HagHuman: Well, that depends on the job. Removing a parasite is no small feat. But I like you, petal. So I'll only ask for something small... One of your pretty little peepers. I'll pluck it from your head, kiss it for luck, then back in it goes. Won't take but a moment. That is my price. Nothing more, nothing less.\nPlayer: You have a deal.",

I even keep secrets from myself - I had my memories suppressed, so that nothing I knew could be used against the Dark Lady. Once I prove myself, my memories will be restored. I'm not sorry I kept this from you. Not one bit. Though perhaps that might change, if you can show an open mind.\nPlayer: I can't trust you. Best if we travel separately for now.",

I assume you've heard of her?\nPlayer: She doesn't sound very appealing, going by her titles.\nShadowheart: The night brings comfort. Through loss, we find acceptance. In the arms of the Dark Mother we find peace.\nPlayer: There has to be something more that draws people to Shar.\nShadowheart: Most fear the dark, like children, because in darkness they see their fears reflected. But Shar teaches us to step beyond fear. Beyond loss. In darkness we do not hide - we act. Pain. Hope. The promise of better days. All of these are heavy cloaks that bend our backs and burden our hearts. We shed those cloaks. Before Shar we stand gloriously naked, beyond the vanities of mortals.\nPlayer: Sounds... daunting. I don't think it's for me.\nShadowheart: Give it time - and thought. We tear down the lies the world is drunk on: the institutions they trust, the so-called gods they worship. The lives they cling to. We destroy false idols, topple corrupt organisations, fight heretics wherever they're found. There's often suffering - death even. Many people break before they embrace Shar's truths.\nPlayer: It sounds evil.",

In the arms of the Dark Mother we find peace.\nPlayer: I don't quite understand.\nShadowheart: Most fear the dark, like children, because in darkness they see their fears reflected. But Shar teaches us to step beyond fear. Beyond loss. In darkness we do not hide - we act. Pain. Hope. The promise of better days.

I don't think it's for me.\nShadowheart: Give it time - and thought. We tear down the lies the world is drunk on: the institutions they trust, the so-called gods they worship.

Tell me how.\nInternalNodeContext: He's not altogether sure why this task is falling to the player and not to him, but also doesn't want to challenge his queen's motivations.\nVlaakith: SILENCE, W'wargaz. There is someone inside. Their mind is warped, broken - a blight. They are an agent of the Grand Design. Sent to sabotage the Astral Prism - our last defence against the return of the Illithid Empire. As long as they live, the Prism is compromised. Find the one inside and kill them. Be aware - they are not alone, and they will appeal to your trust. They are not to be believed. You must accept. Refuse, and know my fury.\nPlayer: I will do as you wish.",

I have as many as I care to make.\nPlayer: As you mention serving Ketheric, he sent you to find a relic, no?\nBalthazar: General Thorm to you. But yes, recovering the relic is the crux of it.

I will put you to work - as a scout.\nNarrator: *This necromancer has Ketheric's trust. Helping him could be just what you need to gain access to the man himself.*\nPlayer: What are the properties of this relic, magical or otherwise? So I can be of better assistance, of course. I need more to go on. Why is this relic so important? What does it do?\nBalthazar: Fine, if it'll spare me your bleating. The relic lends the General his strength, his invulnerability. It must be recovered, before his enemies attempt to exploit it. The Nightsong lends the General his strength, his invulnerability. It must be recovered, before his enemies attempt to exploit it.\nPlayer: Sounds like you've good reason to be proud of the Nightsong - tell me more.\nBalthazar: And spoil the surprise? I think not. But let's just say that the Nightsong was a unique specimen even before I began my work... Words - even my words - are woefully insufficient. When you see for yourself, you will understand.\nPlayer: What do you need me to do?\nBalthazar: I do not need you, or your help. But you are here in spite of that, so I may as well make use of you. The relic is close, but the way is barred and Shar's dead are... uncooperative. Clear the path for me - by blade, cunning, or whatever it takes.

But perhaps better to play along, for now.\nPlayer: For jobs like this it's good form to provide your operatives some extra resources.\nBalthazar: Fine. I will assign Flesh to aid you on your way. Ring this bell... ...Hmm. Misplaced, it seems. You will be capable enough without it.\nPlayer: This sounds like your problem, not mine.

    "conversation": "Havkelaag: Ah, a fellow inhabitor of the Underdark. You find yourself in the cradle of all knowledge relating to our subterranean home: the Society of Brilliance. Tell me, what can the Society do for you?\nPlayer: I carry an unhatched githyanki egg. Would you be interested in studying it?\nHavkelaag: A githyanki egg? What a fortuitous turn of events. I've been attempting to get my hands on one for some time now. Would you consider parting with it? The Society's coffers are deep enough to cover any expenses accrued in its retrieval, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: Chk. Don't you dare consider it.\nPlayer: What are you going to do with it?\nHavkelaag: Study it, of course. Your kind have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months. Most on this plane believe you to be innately cruel, violent beings. Evil, if you will. As citizens of the Underdark, we face similar stigmas. Totally unfounded, of course - our natures are as unfixed as any who walk the surface. I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: You assume my people are evil, yet your research is built on sheer superstition.\nHavkelaag: Enough of your kind have wreaked destruction on this plane for me to be confident in my assertion. When I have a suitable sample for my study, I will, however, prove that the effects of their biological inclination are reversible. Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue. Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: Why follow the dogma of a draconic god?\nHavkelaag: In my years of study, they're the closest I've found to moral perfection. Only under such rigorous 'goodness' will the subject stand a chance of being cured. My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: And what if your experiment fails?\nHavkelaag: If the child remains evil after the experiment is concluded, it will be destroyed. Such is the fate of all used specimens. Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg? ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: A gith hatchling is not a lab rat! This shka'keth should be bled dry for the mere suggestion.\nPlayer: Sell the egg.\nHavkelaag: Ah. Unfortunately, it seems I've mislaid my purse. I don't suppose you'd consider simply donating it to the Society instead?\nPlayer: Fine. Here you go.",

A tadpole's puppet, nothing more. He spoke in accusations. Apostasy, conspiracy, sedition. I will soon be hanged on the city gallows to a chorus of cheers. You might have unlocked my cell, but there's no escape from this place.\nWyll: The Hells with that. Nothing is over. Not while I still draw breath.\nPlayer: I'm breaking you out. With Ravengard gone, Baldur's Gate needs you. Gorion's Ward overcame great odds to protect the city. You can do the same.\nCounsellor Florrick: 'When the people need a miracle, you cannot wait for the gods to answer.'\nWyll: Father's words.\nCounsellor Florrick: Indeed. To think I'd almost forgotten. No more sulking. I know what to do. And I can only do it with the help of the Blade. No more sulking. I know what to do. Unlock my cell, escort me out of Wyrm's Rock. I'll seek out my connections. When the city's streets shatter, you'll want their blades.\nPlayer: I won't help you.",

He knows I will deliver. He knows I will stand by him long after all others wilt and fall. You, Z'rell, all the rest... you have only one body with which to serve. I have as many as I care to make.\nPlayer: Yet you seem no closer to retrieving the Nightsong? I read your notes - very interesting.\nBalthazar: Interesting, and private. Give me one reason why I shouldn't have my creations kill you right now, thief.\nPlayer: I received permission. Take it up with your peers at Moonrise, if you have an issue.\nBalthazar: ...Fine. I'll forgive your transgressions this time - there are much grander things at stake.\nNodeContext: A pause before 'fine' - weighing up the player's fate.\nBalthazar: The Nightsong is my finest creation - if I never exceed myself, I will still die happy. Not that I ever intend to do something as gauche as truly dying, of course. Now, given your prying nature, I have work for you, as a scout. The Nightsong lends the General his strength, his invulnerability. It must be recovered, before his enemies attempt to exploit it.\nPlayer: You need my help?\nBalthazar: I do not need you, or your help. But you are here in spite of that, so I may as well make use of you. The relic is close, but the way is barred and Shar's dead are... uncooperative. Clear the path for me - by blade, cunning, or whatever it takes. I will remain here until you have succeeded, or fallen.\nShadowheart: I'd trust this gasbag about as far as I can throw him - which isn't far.

    "conversation": "Havkelaag: Ah, a fellow inhabitor of the Underdark. You find yourself in the cradle of all knowledge relating to our subterranean home: the Society of Brilliance. Tell me, what can the Society do for you?\nPlayer: I carry an unhatched githyanki egg. Would you be interested in studying it?\nHavkelaag: A githyanki egg? What a fortuitous turn of events. I've been attempting to get my hands on one for some time now. Would you consider parting with it? The Society's coffers are deep enough to cover any expenses accrued in its retrieval, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: Chk. Don't you dare consider it.\nPlayer: What are you going to do with it?\nHavkelaag: Study it, of course. Your kind have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months. Most on this plane believe you to be innately cruel, violent beings. Evil, if you will. As citizens of the Underdark, we face similar stigmas. Totally unfounded, of course - our natures are as unfixed as any who walk the surface. I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: You're letting your personal biases affect your method. Why assume they're evil?\nHavkelaag: I assume nothing. Innate githyanki cruelty is an established fact - no doubt you witnessed it yourself in the retrieval of the egg itself. When I have a suitable sample for my study, I will, however, prove that the effects of their biological inclination are reversible. Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue. Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: What's the Ptarian code?\nHavkelaag: A series of moral imperatives bestowed by the great dragon-deity Bahamut. In my years of study, they're the closest I've found to moral perfection. Only under such rigorous 'goodness' will the subject stand a chance of being cured. My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: An experiment like this will only confirm the surface dwellers' suspicion of us.\nHavkelaag: Of course it won't. If anything, it will do quite the opposite. The academic institutions up here will finally be forced to take us seriously. Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg? ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: A gith hatchling is not a lab rat! This shka'keth should be bled dry for the mere suggestion.\nPlayer: Sell the egg.",

The one thing they desperately wanted to keep out of their enemies' grasp. I had to have it.\nPlayer: You thought you could best the Absolute?

Perhaps we can find terms that will allow blades to remain sheathed.\nPlayer: All right, you wish to negotiate? Make me an offer then.\nViconia DeVir: How about the artefact for your life? And perhaps even my support in the battles yet to come, against the Absolute?\nPlayer: Shar will allow you to make such an offer?\nViconia DeVir: My Lady ... she does not heed this new threat.

You would not speak ill of a god. Would you?\nLae'zel: Do not test her. She will be our ruin.\nPlayer: I spoke too hastily - please forgive me.",

Someone told them to rot in the Nine Hells, that we weren't going anywhere. Maybe that's why they picked him. Told him to kneel... They took his eyes first. Then his tongue.\nPlayer: How did you survive?\nAlfira: Some of us fought back - or tried to. But it was hopeless. All I could do was run.\nPlayer: Only fools fight an ambush. Better to live and strike another day - preferably to the neck.\nAlfira: That means a lot, coming from you. You always seem to take everything in your stride. How do you do it? How do you keep going?\nPlayer: I'll let you know when I figure it out.\nAlfira: We're in the same boat, then? That's... somewhat of a comfort. You've done so much for us already, but I have to ask - the others might still be out there. If they're not dead, they're in Moonrise.

Who in their right mind would infiltrate a goblin infested temple. Unless... ...Hrrm. That look in your eyes - I've seen it before. Are you feeling all right?\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Halsin raises a hand to your head, magically connecting with you (no contact). He gives an alarmed look - he knows what’s inside you\nHalsin: Oak Father preserve you, child... You're infected, aren't you? The mind flayers' spawn. But... something's different. You're aware of the monster inside you. You don't bow to the Absolute, like the True Souls do... How is this possible...?\nPlayer: I think this artefact has something to do with it.\nHalsin: Hmmm... that looks very alien. As alien as the mind flayers. They do not belong on this world. You weren't speaking lightly when you said you needed help. Let me tell you what I know. I've been studying these parasites for a while now. Ever since I discovered these so-called True Souls are infected with them. Someone is using very powerful magic to modify these tadpoles. They are using them to exert control over the infected. I'm sorry to say, I can't undo that magic, which means I can't cure you. But that doesn't mean I can't help. I didn't find what I came here for - a way to remove the tadpoles - but I found the next best thing. I found out where they come from. That must be where these enchantments are placed on them, and it's where you'll find your cure.\nPlayer: So all of this was for nothing.\nHalsin: Patience. I can't just snap my fingers... but I know where the solution almost certainly lies. I overheard that the cultists are sending all of their captives to Moonrise Towers. Innocents go in, True Souls come out. Given that all of these True Souls are infected, it has to be the source of this magic. If you want to find a cure, you must head there and discover how the tadpoles are being manipulated.\nPlayer: You seem to know a lot about this. Will you come with me to Moonrise?\nHalsin: I wish I could, but there's still work I've yet to finish - blood I've yet to spill. I've no right to ask more of you... but if you could help me, I'd be free to join your journey to Moonrise. I cannot allow these butchers to threaten my grove. The natural order must be protected.\nPlayer: Look around you - there's no order anymore. Only chaos.\nHalsin: Chaos is welcome, in doses; it helps keep balance. But this is too much - this is unnatural. Help me kill the leaders of this horde, save my grove. Then I will help you.\n Three deaths could win us peace: the drow Minthara, the hobgoblin Dror Ragzlin, and that perversion of a priestess, Gut. They are the ones holding these parasites together. Remove them and nature will cure itself.\nPlayer: You ask too much of me. I can't help you.",

How do you keep going?\nPlayer: It helps to remember what is at stake - I fight for nature, for balance. I fight for life itself.\nAlfira: You're made of sterner stuff than me then.

Tell me, what can the Society do for you?\nPlayer: I met an expeditioner claiming to work for you. She sought a githyanki egg.\nHavkelaag: Yes, dear Lady Esther. One of our most reliable contractors, though unfortunately this particular request was too much even for her. I believe she quite lost her senses over the task. She came here insisting I purchase an owlbear egg from her, of all things. I don't suppose you've stumbled across any githyanki eggs during your travels? The Society will compensate you for any we purchase, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54]) Would you consider parting with it? The Society's coffers are deep enough to cover any expenses accrued in its retrieval, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: Chk. Don't you dare consider it.\nPlayer: What are you going to do with it?\nHavkelaag: Study it, of course. The githyanki have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months. You are no doubt aware that citizens of the Underdark are held in great suspicion by those who live above ground. Many believe us to be 'evil'. The githyanki face similar prejudice, but I believe, if hatched in a less violent, more intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome its evil predispositions. I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: You assume my people are evil, yet your research is built on sheer superstition.\nHavkelaag: Enough of your kind have wreaked destruction on this plane for me to be confident in my assertion. When I have a suitable sample for my study, I will, however, prove that the effects of their biological inclination are reversible. Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue. Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: What's the Ptarian code?\nHavkelaag: A series of moral imperatives bestowed by the great dragon-deity Bahamut. In my years of study, they're the closest I've found to moral perfection. Only under such rigorous 'goodness' will the subject stand a chance of being cured. My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: And what if your experiment fails?\nHavkelaag: If the child remains evil after the experiment is concluded, it will be destroyed. Such is the fate of all used specimens. Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg? ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: A gith hatchling is not a lab rat! This shka'keth should be bled dry for the mere suggestion.\nPlayer: Sell the egg.\nHavkelaag: Ah. Unfortunately, it seems I've mislaid my purse. I don't suppose you'd consider simply donating it to the Society instead?\nPlayer: Fine. Here you go.",

You know what's at stake here, I take it?\nPlayer: Nere mentioned that you were seeking access to the Temple.

You know what's at stake here, I take it?\nPlayer: Judging by how you're cowering in here, your survival?\nBalthazar: I do not cower - I plan. I command. I create. General Thorm trusts me. He knows I will deliver. He knows I will stand by him long after all others wilt and fall. You, Z'rell, all the rest... you have only one body with which to serve. I have as many as I care to make.\nPlayer: As you mention serving Ketheric, he sent you to find a relic, no?\nBalthazar: General Thorm to you. But yes, recovering the relic is the crux of it. He commands, and I, his humble servant, fulfil that command. While you, an infinitely more humble servant, fulfil my command. I will put you to work - as a scout.\nNarrator: *This necromancer has Ketheric's trust. Helping him could be just what you need to gain access to the man himself.*\nPlayer: I need more to go on. Why is this relic so important? What does it do?\nBalthazar: Fine, if it'll spare me your bleating. The relic lends the General his strength, his invulnerability. It must be recovered, before his enemies attempt to exploit it. The Nightsong lends the General his strength, his invulnerability. It must be recovered, before his enemies attempt to exploit it.\nPlayer: You need my help?\nBalthazar: I do not need you, or your help. But you are here in spite of that, so I may as well make use of you. The relic is close, but the way is barred and Shar's dead are... uncooperative. Clear the path for me - by blade, cunning, or whatever it takes. I will remain here until you have succeeded, or fallen.\nShadowheart: I'd trust this gasbag about as far as I can throw him - which isn't far. But perhaps better to play along, for now.\nPlayer: You have resources to spare - give me something to aid my search.\nBalthazar: Fine. I will assign Flesh to aid you on your way.

Tell me, what can the Society do for you?\nPlayer: I carry an unhatched githyanki egg. Would you be interested in studying it?\nHavkelaag: A githyanki egg? What a fortuitous turn of events. I've been attempting to get my hands on one for some time now. Would you consider parting with it? The Society's coffers are deep enough to cover any expenses accrued in its retrieval, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: Chk. Don't you dare consider it.\nPlayer: What are you going to do with it?\nHavkelaag: Study it, of course. The githyanki have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months. You are no doubt aware that citizens of the Underdark are held in great suspicion by those who live above ground. Many believe us to be 'evil'. The githyanki face similar prejudice, but I believe, if hatched in a less violent, more intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome its evil predispositions. I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: What does this 'intellectually stimulating' upbringing look like?\nHavkelaag: In the literal sense, I will need to induce the egg to hatch via the application of certain currents to the creature inside. Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue. Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: So you're planning to torture a child for a year?\nHavkelaag: The child will be a better individual after my treatment than it ever would have been had it been raised in its natural environment. Any suffering it endures will therefore be worth it, for the child, perhaps for the whole of civilised society. My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: No benefit could justify you inflicting such cruelty.\nHavkelaag: Rigorous experimental methods demand we do not indulge our own emotional responses in the application of discomfort to our subjects. Only by the full, uninhibited application of psionic stimuli will we have a true measure of whether the child's innate evil has been cured. Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg? ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: A gith hatchling is not a lab rat! This shka'keth should be bled dry for the mere suggestion.\nPlayer: Sell the egg.\nHavkelaag: Ah. Unfortunately, it seems I've mislaid my purse. I don't suppose you'd consider simply donating it to the Society instead?\nPlayer: Fine. Here you go.",

I take it the breaking of my skeletons was an accident - the living are so clumsy, after all.\nPlayer: Another True Soul was looking for you. Nere - I aided him in the Underdark.\nBalthazar: Ah, it was you who pulled his sorry carcass from the rubble. You should have left him there. The miserable worm tried to kill me, hoping to take all the glory of this mission for himself. Dull, dull, dull. Nere was never cut out to be a True Soul - he's a very obedient corpse, though. Perhaps you can prove to me that you're more useful alive than dead. You know what's at stake here, I take it? But you're here now, and I may be able to put those limbs to work. You know what's at stake here, I take it?\nPlayer: Z'rell spoke of a relic - something called the Nightsong in your notes. They were very interesting. Yet you seem no closer to retrieving the Nightsong? I read your notes - very interesting.\nBalthazar: Interesting, and private. Give me one reason why I shouldn't have my creations kill you right now, thief.\nPlayer: Because I'll rip your tongue out, shove it down your throat, then stomp on your 'creations' until they are dirt beneath my feet. You're hiding from shadows - literally. Don't make threats you can't back up.\nBalthazar: ...Fine. I'll forgive your transgressions this time - there are much grander things at stake.\nNodeContext: A pause before 'fine' - weighing up the player's fate.\nBalthazar: The Nightsong is my finest creation - if I never exceed myself, I will still die happy. Not that I ever intend to do something as gauche as truly dying, of course. Now, given your prying nature, I have work for you, as a scout. The Nightsong lends the General his strength, his invulnerability. It must be recovered, before his enemies attempt to exploit it.\nPlayer: You need my help?\nBalthazar: I do not need you, or your help. But you are here in spite of that, so I may as well make use of you. The Nightsong is close, but the way is barred and Shar's dead are... uncooperative. Clear the path for me - by blade, cunning, or whatever it takes. I will remain here until you have succeeded, or fallen.\nShadowheart: I'd trust this gasbag about as far as I can throw him - which isn't far. But perhaps better to play along, for now.\nPlayer: For jobs like this it's good form to provide your operatives some extra resources.\nBalthazar: Fine. I will assign Flesh to aid you on your way. Ring this bell... ...Hmm. Misplaced, it seems. You will be capable enough without it.\nPlayer: This sounds like your problem, not mine. Keep it - this is your problem, not mine.\nBalthazar: This is not a problem - it is an opportunity. And it is not a choice either - you will obey.\nPlayer: Fine. I'll see what I can do.

Do not focus on the many, many others - Boo will handle them.\n\nPlayer: Speak, then.\nViconia DeVir: Welcome to the true heart of the House of Grief. For what is grief but a facet of loss? And what is loss but the very nature of my Lady Shar's power? I saw in your mind, when we spoke above. Quite an adventure has brought you to this point - illithids, kidnapping, infection, the Hells, hunted by cultists and githyanki alike... and of course, the artefact. You have value. Quite an adventure has brought you to this point - illithids, kidnapping, infection, the Hells, hunted by cultists and githyanki alike... and of course, the artefact.\nNodeContext: Ill-ih-thids\nPlayer: It's called an Astral Prism. And let me guess - you want it. An old song, take my word for it.\nViconia DeVir: Its name does not concern me. Its power does. I have been awaiting word of this item for some time, ever since I dispatched a cadre of Lady Shar's children to retrieve it. I have been very patient, but no more. I felt Shadowheart's presence in your mind, and with it, the artefact. She succeeded in retrieving it, but then it is you who appeared, not her. Where is the artefact?\nPlayer: Why do you even want it?\nViconia DeVir: I did not consent to questions. But I suppose you have undergone a great deal to reach this place, and anything I tell you cannot compromise me now - for you will either leave on my terms, or not at all... Whispers reached my ears from all corners - potential rivals of Lady Shar, all vying for the same prize. A new god, amassing the disaffected, the outcasts - those who should turn to us. This 'Absolute' is but an upstart; disturbing the natural order and threatening to impede the glorious return of Lady Shar's pure, endless darkness. I had to act. I had to strangle that foul conspiracy while it was still in the cradle. We learned all we could - the artefact was the one thing the Absolutists feared. The one thing they desperately wanted to keep out of their enemies' grasp. I had to have it.\nPlayer: You thought you could best the Absolute? The githyanki?\nViconia DeVir: To fight so many foes openly could prove unwise. Shar's children are better deployed as daggers in the shadows, not massed upon a battlefield. So let the others fight, while we wait. Once they are spent and bloodied from each other, we would slip in and take the prize. Alas, most of those I sent, perished. All but one - Shadowheart.\nNarrator: *Viconia trails off, holding your gaze with a dark, hungry look. She has staked everything on acquiring the Astral Prism.*\nViconia DeVir: I felt Shadowheart's presence in your mind, and with it, the artefact. She succeeded in retrieving it, but then it is you who appeared, not her. Where is the artefact?\nPlayer: Somehow I'm not sure I should tell you.\nViconia DeVir: Then this will be a very short conversation. I have not assembled my forces here just to spectate. Humour me with a little negotiation. Perhaps we can find terms that will allow blades to remain sheathed.\nPlayer: As far as the artefact is concerned, there's nothing to discuss.\nViconia DeVir: Reconsider. Aid me, and you can count on my support against the Absolute. Reject me, and your journey ends here. How about the artefact for your life? And perhaps even my support in the battles yet to come, against the Absolute?\nPlayer: The artefact alone can't save you. Best if we unite against our common enemy - the Absolute.\nViconia DeVir: My interest is defeating the Absolute. It seems you're on that path already. I will not have it said that I am unreasonable. Shadowheart. Surrender her to me - she has much to answer for.\nPlayer: Let me go, and I'll bring her to you.",

Your kind have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months. Most on this plane believe you to be innately cruel, violent beings. Evil, if you will. As citizens of the Underdark, we face similar stigmas. Totally unfounded, of course - our natures are as unfixed as any who walk the surface. I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: You assume my people are evil, yet your research is built on sheer superstition.\nHavkelaag: Enough of your kind have wreaked destruction on this plane for me to be confident in my assertion. When I have a suitable sample for my study, I will, however, prove that the effects of their biological inclination are reversible. Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue. Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: You would teach the child virtue, but rear it without patience. Curious.\nHavkelaag: Tell me, then, philosopher - if patience delays the fostering of the other virtues, can it be rightly called virtuous?\nPlayer: Perhaps not. Patience is important, but cannot impede the other virtues.\nHavkelaag: Then we are in accord - the time for action is now. My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: Sounds pointless. Public opinion will hardly be swayed by such a small experiment.\nHavkelaag: Not at first. But if the experiment proves successful, it must be repeated. Only then will we know if the findings are to be trusted. Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg?

The Astral Prism - it is corrupted.\nCh'r'ai W'wargaz: I shall cleanse it for you, my queen. Tell me how.\nInternalNodeContext: He's not altogether sure why this task is falling to the player and not to him, but also doesn't want to challenge his queen's motivations.\nVlaakith: SILENCE, W'wargaz. There is someone inside. Their mind is warped, broken - a blight. They are an agent of the Grand Design. Sent to sabotage the Astral Prism - our last defence against the return of the Illithid Empire. As long as they live, the Prism is compromised. Find the one inside and kill them. Be aware - they are not alone, and they will appeal to your trust. They are not to be believed. You must accept. Refuse, and know my fury.\nPlayer: I will do as you wish.",

The githyanki have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months. You yourself have no doubt experienced the prejudice of those who assume that, as beings of the Underdark, we are inherently evil. The githyanki face similar prejudice, but I believe, if hatched in a less violent, more intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome its evil predispositions. I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: You assume my people are evil, yet your research is built on sheer superstition.\nHavkelaag: Enough of your kind have wreaked destruction on this plane for me to be confident in my assertion. When I have a suitable sample for my study, I will, however, prove that the effects of their biological inclination are reversible. Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue. Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: So you're planning to torture a child for a year?\nHavkelaag: The child will be a better individual after my treatment than it ever would have been had it been raised in its natural environment. Any suffering it endures will therefore be worth it, for the child, perhaps for the whole of civilised society. My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: And what if your experiment fails?\nHavkelaag: If the child remains evil after the experiment is concluded, it will be destroyed. Such is the fate of all used specimens. Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg?

You know what's at stake here, I take it? But you're here now, and I may be able to put those limbs to work. You know what's at stake here, I take it?\nPlayer: Nere mentioned that you were seeking access to the Temple. Looks like you found it.\nBalthazar: Perhaps you'd be more useful dead than alive if you don't even know what I'm seeking here. But you're here now, and I may be able to put those limbs to work. You know what's at stake here, I take it?\nPlayer: Judging by how you're cowering in here, your survival?\nBalthazar: I do not cower - I plan. I command. I create. General Thorm trusts me. He knows I will deliver. He knows I will stand by him long after all others wilt and fall. You and all the rest have only one body with which to serve. I have as many as I care to make. You, Z'rell, all the rest... you have only one body with which to serve. I have as many as I care to make.\nPlayer: Yet you seem no closer to retrieving the Nightsong? I read your notes - very interesting.\nBalthazar: Interesting, and private. Give me one reason why I shouldn't have my creations kill you right now, thief.\nPlayer: You're hiding from shadows - literally. Don't make threats you can't back up.\nBalthazar: ...Fine. I'll forgive your transgressions this time - there are much grander things at stake.\nNodeContext: A pause before 'fine' - weighing up the player's fate.\nBalthazar: The Nightsong is my finest creation - if I never exceed myself, I will still die happy. Not that I ever intend to do something as gauche as truly dying, of course. Now, given your prying nature, I have work for you, as a scout. The Nightsong lends the General his strength, his invulnerability. It must be recovered, before his enemies attempt to exploit it.\nPlayer: You need my help?\nBalthazar: I do not need you, or your help. But you are here in spite of that, so I may as well make use of you. The relic is close, but the way is barred and Shar's dead are... uncooperative. Clear the path for me - by blade, cunning, or whatever it takes. I will remain here until you have succeeded, or fallen.\nShadowheart: I'd trust this gasbag about as far as I can throw him - which isn't far. But perhaps better to play along, for now.\nPlayer: For jobs like this it's good form to provide your operatives some extra resources.\nBalthazar: Fine. I will assign Flesh to aid you on your way.

The githyanki have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months. You yourself have no doubt experienced the prejudice of those who assume that, as beings of the Underdark, we are inherently evil. The githyanki face similar prejudice, but I believe, if hatched in a less violent, more intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome its evil predispositions. I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: What does this 'intellectually stimulating' upbringing look like?\nHavkelaag: In the literal sense, I will need to induce the egg to hatch via the application of certain currents to the creature inside.

Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: This experiment is exactly the kind of evil you're trying to disprove.\nHavkelaag: The pursuit of knowledge is neither evil nor good. Only in the application of such knowledge should one take on any moral imperative. My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: No benefit could justify you inflicting such cruelty.\nHavkelaag: Rigorous experimental methods demand we do not indulge our own emotional responses in the application of discomfort to our subjects. Only by the full, uninhibited application of psionic stimuli will we have a true measure of whether the child's innate evil has been cured. Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg?

Do not focus on the many, many others - Boo will handle them.\n\nPlayer: With such an audience? A trap, if I ever saw one.\nViconia DeVir: A trap? Perhaps. But not all traps need to be sprung. Sometimes it's wiser to await an even greater prey. I saw in your mind, when we spoke above. Quite an adventure has brought you to this point - illithids, kidnapping, infection, the Hells, hunted by cultists and githyanki alike... and of course, the artefact. You have value. Quite an adventure has brought you to this point - illithids, kidnapping, infection, the Hells, hunted by cultists and githyanki alike... and of course, the artefact.\nNodeContext: Ill-ih-thids\nPlayer: It's called an Astral Prism. And let me guess - you want it. An old song, take my word for it.\nViconia DeVir: Its name does not concern me. Its power does. I have been awaiting word of this item for some time, ever since I dispatched a cadre of Lady Shar's children to retrieve it. I have been very patient, but no more. I felt Shadowheart's presence in your mind, and with it, the artefact. She succeeded in retrieving it, but then it is you who appeared, not her. Where is the artefact?\nPlayer: Long gone. That thing was more trouble than it was worth.\nViconia DeVir: No, I think not. The artefact occupies you greatly, I felt it. Most curiously as well - like you hate it and need it. Millstone and life preserver. Humour me with a little negotiation. Perhaps we can find terms that will allow blades to remain sheathed.\nPlayer: All right, you wish to negotiate? Make me an offer then.\nViconia DeVir: How about the artefact for your life? And perhaps even my support in the battles yet to come, against the Absolute?\nPlayer: This must be truly important, if Shar would allow you to make such an offer. Why do you want it?\nViconia DeVir: My Lady ... she does not heed this new threat. This Absolute. Perhaps she is above such mortal concerns, but I must preserve her church, even if she does not ask me to. When I deal with the Absolute, my standing with Lady Shar will be stronger than ever. My rightful place is at her right hand, and I will remain there. I will not be replaced by Shadow...\nNarrator: *You suddenly realise what has been troubling her. Shar has rewarded her loyalty by forcing her to groom her own replacement - Shadowheart.*\nPlayer: Not happening. Even if I wanted to give it to you, I can't. The artefact is bound to me. It will kill you.\nViconia DeVir: My interest is defeating the Absolute. It seems you're on that path already. I will not have it said that I am unreasonable. Shadowheart. Surrender her to me - she has much to answer for.\nPlayer: Let me go, and I'll bring her to you.",

Do not focus on the many, many others - Boo will handle them.\n\nPlayer: We already spoke - if you can call that 'Mapping' farce a conversation.\nViconia DeVir: A necessary ruse - one that allowed me to seek out your true intentions. The House of Grief attracts all manner of people, but only some have value to Lady Shar. You have value. Quite an adventure has brought you to this point - illithids, kidnapping, infection, the Hells, hunted by cultists and githyanki alike... and of course, the artefact.\nNodeContext: Ill-ih-thids\nPlayer: It's called an Astral Prism. And let me guess - you want it. An old song, take my word for it.\nViconia DeVir: Its name does not concern me. Its power does. I have been awaiting word of this item for some time, ever since I dispatched a cadre of Lady Shar's children to retrieve it. I have been very patient, but no more.

But I suppose you have undergone a great deal to reach this place, and anything I tell you cannot compromise me now - for you will either leave on my terms, or not at all... Whispers reached my ears from all corners - potential rivals of Lady Shar, all vying for the same prize. A new god, amassing the disaffected, the outcasts - those who should turn to us. This 'Absolute' is but an upstart; disturbing the natural order and threatening to impede the glorious return of Lady Shar's pure, endless darkness. I had to act. I had to strangle that foul conspiracy while it was still in the cradle. We learned all we could - the artefact was the one thing the Absolutists feared. The one thing they desperately wanted to keep out of their enemies' grasp. I had to have it.\nPlayer: You thought you could best the Absolute? The githyanki?\nViconia DeVir: To fight so many foes openly could prove unwise. Shar's children are better deployed as daggers in the shadows, not massed upon a battlefield. So let the others fight, while we wait. Once they are spent and bloodied from each other, we would slip in and take the prize. Alas, most of those I sent, perished. All but one - Shadowheart.\nNarrator: *Viconia trails off, holding your gaze with a dark, hungry look.

She succeeded in retrieving it, but then it is you who appeared, not her. Where is the artefact?\nPlayer: Long gone. That thing was more trouble than it was worth.\nViconia DeVir: No, I think not. The artefact occupies you greatly, I felt it. Most curiously as well - like you hate it and need it. Millstone and life preserver. Humour me with a little negotiation. Perhaps we can find terms that will allow blades to remain sheathed.\nPlayer: All right, you wish to negotiate? Make me an offer then.\nViconia DeVir: How about the artefact for your life? And perhaps even my support in the battles yet to come, against the Absolute?\nPlayer: Not happening. Even if I wanted to give it to you, I can't. The artefact is bound to me. It will kill you.\nViconia DeVir: My interest is defeating the Absolute. It seems you're on that path already. I will not have it said that I am unreasonable. Shadowheart.

For your own safety.\nGROUP_Act3_WYR_OrinsImpersonation_FlamingFist: Is that so? Enigmatic soul, aren't you? A word of advice then - you might not get as warm a welcome as in days gone by. Used to be you'd arrive knowing you'd a full belly and a warm bed waiting for you. Not any more. These days, there's barely enough to go around. Add the refugees on top and... well, folk aren't feeling too generous.\nPlayer: Is there anything I can do to ease these people's burden?\nGROUP_Act3_WYR_OrinsImpersonation_FlamingFist: I've been asking myself the same question. I wouldn't be the first to interfere. Some well-to-do's in the city donated enough to see the newcomers right for the time being. Only they didn't bother helping everyone else. Locals going without while strangers feast - it's stoked the fire, all right. Some Baldurians are kicking up a fuss round the front of the barn as we speak. If I wasn't wearing this uniform, I'd walk round there and teach them a lesson they'd never forget.\nPlayer: The people of this city have grown selfish. They need reminding what true hardship is.\nNightwarden Minthara: We can be the reminder. Soft citizens make easy targets.\nGROUP_Act3_WYR_OrinsImpersonation_FlamingFist: Too bloody right. They've gone soft behind those walls, forgotten what it's like to struggle, living hand-to-mouth. I say we march round there and slit a few bellies. Remind them how much worse things could be. What do you say? We need to march round the front, and kill every last one of them. Let's see them eat our food with their guts on the floor.

Whispers reached my ears from all corners - potential rivals of Lady Shar, all vying for the same prize. A new god, amassing the disaffected, the outcasts - those who should turn to us. This 'Absolute' is but an upstart; disturbing the natural order and threatening to impede the glorious return of Lady Shar's pure, endless darkness. I had to act. I had to strangle that foul conspiracy while it was still in the cradle. We learned all we could - the artefact was the one thing the Absolutists feared. The one thing they desperately wanted to keep out of their enemies' grasp. I had to have it.\nPlayer: You thought you could best the Absolute? The githyanki?\nViconia DeVir: To fight so many foes openly could prove unwise. Shar's children are better deployed as daggers in the shadows, not massed upon a battlefield. So let the others fight, while we wait. Once they are spent and bloodied from each other, we would slip in and take the prize. Alas, most of those I sent, perished. All but one - Shadowheart.\nNarrator: *Viconia trails off, holding your gaze with a dark, hungry look. She has staked everything on acquiring the Astral Prism.*\nViconia DeVir: I felt Shadowheart's presence in your mind, and with it, the artefact. She succeeded in retrieving it, but then it is you who appeared, not her. Where is the artefact?\nPlayer: Long gone. That thing was more trouble than it was worth.\nViconia DeVir: No, I think not. The artefact occupies you greatly, I felt it. Most curiously as well - like you hate it and need it. Millstone and life preserver. Humour me with a little negotiation. Perhaps we can find terms that will allow blades to remain sheathed.\nPlayer: As far as the artefact is concerned, there's nothing to discuss.\nViconia DeVir: Reconsider. Aid me, and you can count on my support against the Absolute. Reject me, and your journey ends here. How about the artefact for your life? And perhaps even my support in the battles yet to come, against the Absolute?\nPlayer: The artefact alone can't save you. Best if we unite against our common enemy - the Absolute.\nViconia DeVir: My interest is defeating the Absolute. It seems you're on that path already. I will not have it said that I am unreasonable. Shadowheart. Surrender her to me - she has much to answer for.\nPlayer: Let me go, and I'll bring her to you.",

See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy. Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace. Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver. Come. Step forward. I can see the love of Shar darken your eyes.

What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being? If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: But you: look how the succour of Shar eludes even you, one who walks faithfully in her shadow. See how painfully present you remain... We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: The sisters aren't ready. They'll make me sick instead of curing me.\nMalus Thorm: Their incisions are, as yet, still streaked with imprecision - that much I must concede.

For are we not all in need of a cure? The scalpel does not discriminate. Let each and every one of you partake in its soothing journey. Absence, sisters. Acquaint yourselves.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) Screaming and slashing, the sisters brutally murder each other.\nMalus Thorm: It is a proud moment when one sees one's teachings so lovingly taken to heart.

Quiet... There it goes... Everyone here is mad - even you, especially me - and that makes them dangerous. But it also makes them stupid. I'll make you seem as ruined as the rest of the people here. A simple glamour to make you a terrible wretch.\nNodeContext: very enthusiastic, casting a spell to disguise the player\nGROUP_Act3_LOW_HouseOfHope_Hope: Now whisper your questions, little wretch.

The Orphic Hammer is the perfect tool for breaking all infernal chains. In the Archive. Down the corridor, past the debtors. OH! The debtors. They won't like you. But I like you.

You should be pleased. I take it the breaking of my skeletons was an accident - the living are so clumsy, after all.\nPlayer: I'm pleased to be of service, Balthazar.\nBalthazar: Perhaps you can prove to me that you're more useful alive than dead. You know what's at stake here, I take it? But you're here now, and I may be able to put those limbs to work. You know what's at stake here, I take it?\nPlayer: Z'rell spoke of a relic - something called the Nightsong in your notes. They were very interesting. Yet you seem no closer to retrieving the Nightsong? I read your notes - very interesting.\nBalthazar: Interesting, and private. Give me one reason why I shouldn't have my creations kill you right now, thief.\nPlayer: I had Z'rell's permission - that good enough for you?\nBalthazar: Z'rell exceeds her authority. But fine, I'll overlook your transgressions this time - there are much grander things at stake. The Nightsong is my finest creation - if I never exceed myself, I will still die happy. Not that I ever intend to do something as gauche as truly dying, of course. Now, given your prying nature, I have work for you, as a scout. The Nightsong lends the General his strength, his invulnerability. It must be recovered, before his enemies attempt to exploit it.\nPlayer: Sounds like you've good reason to be proud of the Nightsong - tell me more.\nBalthazar: And spoil the surprise? I think not. But let's just say that the Nightsong was a unique specimen even before I began my work... Words - even my words - are woefully insufficient. When you see for yourself, you will understand.\nPlayer: What do you need me to do?\nBalthazar: I do not need you, or your help. But you are here in spite of that, so I may as well make use of you. The relic is close, but the way is barred and Shar's dead are... uncooperative. Clear the path for me - by blade, cunning, or whatever it takes. I will remain here until you have succeeded, or fallen.\nShadowheart: I'd trust this gasbag about as far as I can throw him - which isn't far. But perhaps better to play along, for now.\nPlayer: For jobs like this it's good form to provide your operatives some extra resources.\nBalthazar: Fine. I will assign Flesh to aid you on your way. Ring this bell... ...and he will come. My brother is no intellectual powerhouse, but he is strong, loyal and punctual. Should a fight turn against you, remember the bell.\nPlayer: Actually, I have your mother.\nBalthazar: What the...? Give me back my mother, this instant!\nPlayer: No, I think I'll keep her.",

    "conversation": "Havkelaag: Ah, a fellow inhabitor of the Underdark. You find yourself in the cradle of all knowledge relating to our subterranean home: the Society of Brilliance. Tell me, what can the Society do for you?\nPlayer: I met an expeditioner claiming to work for you. She sought a githyanki egg.\nHavkelaag: Yes, dear Lady Esther. One of our most reliable contractors, though unfortunately this particular request was too much even for her. I believe she quite lost her senses over the task. She came here insisting I purchase an owlbear egg from her, of all things. I don't suppose you've stumbled across any githyanki eggs during your travels? The Society will compensate you for any we purchase, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54]) Would you consider parting with it? The Society's coffers are deep enough to cover any expenses accrued in its retrieval, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: Chk. Don't you dare consider it.\nPlayer: What are you going to do with it?\nHavkelaag: Study it, of course. The githyanki have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months. You are no doubt aware that citizens of the Underdark are held in great suspicion by those who live above ground. Many believe us to be 'evil'. The githyanki face similar prejudice, but I believe, if hatched in a less violent, more intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome its evil predispositions. I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: So the child inside will be experimented on?\nHavkelaag: Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue. Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: That kind of indoctrination and time-forced nurture violates the natural order. It invalidates the whole experiment.\nHavkelaag: I won't bother to argue with you. An arboreal shaman can't be expected to understand the rigorous protocols of theoretical research. My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: And what if your experiment fails?\nHavkelaag: If the child remains evil after the experiment is concluded, it will be destroyed. Such is the fate of all used specimens. Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg? ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: A gith hatchling is not a lab rat! This shka'keth should be bled dry for the mere suggestion.\nPlayer: This experiment is barbaric. You're never getting the egg.",

I am the druid Halsin.\nPlayer: I spoke to Nettie - she said you could help me with the parasite in my head.\nHalsin: Parasite in your head...? You mean you have one of them?\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Halsin raises a hand to your head, magically connecting with you (no contact). He gives an alarmed look - he knows what’s inside you\nHalsin: Oak Father preserve you, child... You're infected, aren't you? The mind flayers' spawn. But... something's different. You're aware of the monster inside you. You don't bow to the Absolute, like the True Souls do... How is this possible...?\nPlayer: I don't know.\nHalsin: You weren't speaking lightly when you said you needed help. Let me tell you what I know. I've been studying these parasites for a while now. Ever since I discovered these so-called True Souls are infected with them. Someone is using very powerful magic to modify these tadpoles. They are using them to exert control over the infected. I'm sorry to say, I can't undo that magic, which means I can't cure you. But that doesn't mean I can't help. I didn't find what I came here for - a way to remove the tadpoles - but I found the next best thing. I found out where they come from. That must be where these enchantments are placed on them, and it's where you'll find your cure.\nPlayer: How did you come to study mind flayer parasites?\nHalsin: A drow forced me to defend myself. Afterwards, I was able to study the parasite that slithered out of the corpse, see what drives these 'True Souls'. I had no idea anyone beyond their ranks was infected. You have my sincere sympathies.\nPlayer: What should I do?\nHalsin: I overheard that the cultists are sending all of their captives to Moonrise Towers. Innocents go in, True Souls come out. Given that all of these True Souls are infected, it has to be the source of this magic. If you want to find a cure, you must head there and discover how the tadpoles are being manipulated.\nPlayer: You seem to know a lot about this. Will you come with me to Moonrise?\nHalsin: I wish I could, but there's still work I've yet to finish - blood I've yet to spill. I've no right to ask more of you... but if you could help me, I'd be free to join your journey to Moonrise. I cannot allow these butchers to threaten my grove. The natural order must be protected.\nPlayer: Kagha is dead. She was swayed by Shadow Druids. I had no choice.\nHalsin: Kagha... This is my fault - I was her teacher. I will mourn her when I can. But there are other matters to attend to before that. Chaos is welcome, in doses; it helps keep balance. But this is too much - this is unnatural. Help me kill the leaders of this horde, save my grove. Then I will help you.\n Three deaths could win us peace: the drow Minthara, the hobgoblin Dror Ragzlin, and that perversion of a priestess, Gut. They are the ones holding these parasites together. Remove them and nature will cure itself.\nPlayer: I'll deal with this. You get to safety.\nHalsin: There is no safety. Not while this rot festers. Once it is cut out - once the grove is secure - then I shall leave.\nPlayer: Follow me, then. Your bear form may prove useful.\nHalsin: Be warned - my presence could make things more difficult... I can only restrain my bear form so much. I won't be able to help but attack goblins. If I join you, we'll likely have to slaughter this entire place. You may want to use discretion when approaching the goblin leaders.\nPlayer: Stay here.",

See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy. Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace. Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver. Come. Step forward. I can see the love of Shar darken your eyes.

Only a monster would inflict misery and call it medicine.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being? If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: You are well on your way.

This attack will only strengthen their resolve.\nPlayer: I have no quarrel with druids.\nZevlor: There have been several attacks by different monsters.

Elturel had no place for tieflings after the Descent.\nPlayer: Should've stayed in the Hells - our kind might be treated better there.\nZevlor: Hah - a fair point.

She quickly goes from seeming like a divine spirit to a normal young woman.\nIsobel: I didn't realise I had an audience.\nFist Marcus: Isobel. This is -\nIsobel: A Sharran.\nNarrator: *Isobel. The same name as Ketheric Thorm's daughter - the one whose sarcophagus you found empty in the family mausoleum.*\nPlayer: Push your Urges down. You can tell my allegiance from a look?\nIsobel: It's an aura. Or a lack of one, really. Frankly, I'm surprised you're willing to help us. Your kind aren't known for their decency - particularly when a Sharran curse is our greatest obstacle. But if you are who I think you are, I'd be a fool to reject your help. The True Soul with... well, a soul. Imagine.\nPlayer: I'm glad you've remembered who needs whose help here.\nIsobel: Oh - aren't you looking for a protection spell?\nPlayer: I need nothing from a Selûnite.\nIsobel: But any others who travel with you may not agree. Do it for them at least - you will need all the help you can get out there.\nNarrator: *Pain bursts from the wound on your hand. You see yourself kneeling in a dark hall, surrounded by initiates. A female voice preaches against Selûne and all she stands for. You nod, rapt.*\nInternalNodeContext: Incurable wound imagery/memoriy fragment\nIsobel: Well! If the Moonmaiden didn't strike me dead for blessing you, she must rather approve of this little alliance. This will block the lesser effects of the shadow curse, allowing you to traverse the darkness outside... should Shar's own protection falter, that is. Curious. Surely the Nightsinger could have shielded all her followers, and made this place her domain long ago... yet she only acts now, and aids you alone. I wonder why.\nPlayer: I don't know what to make of it myself.\nIsobel: I suppose Shar is nothing if not mysterious. I'll stop needling you, though. You have more important things to do, after all.\nPlayer: I do, though I already have a Moonlantern. I already have a Moonlantern. I can safely travel the shadows.\nIsobel: Well! If I'd have realised, I'd have spared the theatrics. In that case, you should be able to navigate a path straight to your target. That's good - very good. I wish you luck. The very best of it.\nPlayer: Hold on - Marcus is a True Soul. He's here to kidnap you.",

    "conversation": "[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) We see the Surgeon stand by a table upon which a wriggling human lies strapped down in an X position. Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon’s voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar. See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy. Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace. Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver. Come. Step forward. I can see the love of Shar darken your eyes. Be welcome.\nPlayer: What lesson are you teaching these sisters?\nMalus Thorm: The crux of our worship. Tell me, what is the guiding principle of the goddess?\nPlayer: Loss.\nMalus Thorm: I profess there is another more profound.\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly. It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nWyll: Hells. Only a monster would inflict misery and call it medicine.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being? If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: You are well on your way. But one white orb disfigures you still. Let us finish the cure. We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: Their blades are uneven. Efficient surgery will require further training.\nMalus Thorm: Their incisions are, as yet, still streaked with imprecision - that much I must concede. How to steady their hands, I wonder.\nPlayer: Sparring is vital to progress. Have them practice on each other. Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\nMalus Thorm: Yes... For are we not all in need of a cure? The scalpel does not discriminate. Let each and every one of you partake in its soothing journey. Absence, sisters. Acquaint yourselves.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) Screaming and slashing, the sisters brutally murder each other.\nMalus Thorm: It is a proud moment when one sees one's teachings so lovingly taken to heart. You are to be commended for their graduation - rewarded with the promised cure. Come, I will acquaint you with the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nPlayer: I am but a fumbling squire before a master swordsman. Please, demonstrate so that I might learn. I would rather acquaint myself - if you show me how.\nMalus Thorm: Your diligence is exemplary. Very well: your own scalpel you will be. Observe - then succeed me, into the succour of Shar.",

Have you spoken to Kagha?\nPlayer: I want to discuss something else.\nZevlor: What is it?\nPlayer: I'm looking for a man named Zorru.\nZevlor: You'll find him in camp. What do you want with him?\nPlayer: That is between the two of us.\nZevlor: You'll find him in the caves. But I warn you not to start trouble. There's already enough going. Whatever your business here, I'd see to it quickly - the druids are forcing everyone out. This latest attack will only strengthen their resolve.\nPlayer: Those goblins - have there been many attacks like that?\nZevlor: There have been several attacks by different monsters. The druids blame us 'outsiders' for drawing them here. Nobody's welcome anymore. They've started a ritual to cut the grove off from the world outside. We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: What brought you here?\nZevlor: We're refugees from Elturel - we took shelter here after goblins and gnolls attacked us on the road. We were bound for Baldur's Gate, and it was too late to turn back. Elturel had no place for tieflings after the Descent.\nNarrator: *'The Descent' - an infernal conspiracy that had seen the entire city of Elturel briefly dragged to the Hells.*\nPlayer: Is there a place for tieflings anywhere?\nZevlor: Hah - a fair point. We can only hope the citizens of Baldur's Gate are more open-minded. But we can't get there with those beasts blocking our path. We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: What brought you here?\nZevlor: We're refugees from Elturel - we took shelter here after goblins and gnolls attacked us on the road. We were bound for Baldur's Gate, and it was too late to turn back. Elturel had no place for tieflings after the Descent.\nPlayer: That's sad - but it doesn't mean the druids owe you sanctuary.\nZevlor: It seems you're of a mind with our hosts here. But their ritual will force you out, too. We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: This ritual - is there no way to convince the druids to stop it?\nZevlor: I've tried. Kagha - their new First Druid - won't see me. You, though... I know it's not your business, but she owes you for saving this place. Perhaps you could persuade her. For more time to prepare, if nothing else.\nPlayer: I'm sorry. I've got my own problems.",

You know what's at stake here, I take it?\nPlayer: Judging by how you're cowering in here, your survival?\nBalthazar: I do not cower - I plan. I command. I create. General Thorm trusts me.

I can use it to assist you, or send you screaming to the Fugue Plane. Your choice. You're hiding from shadows - literally. Don't make threats you can't back up.\nBalthazar: ...Fine. I'll forgive your transgressions this time - there are much grander things at stake.\nNodeContext: A pause before 'fine' - weighing up the player's fate.\nBalthazar: The Nightsong is my finest creation - if I never exceed myself, I will still die happy. Not that I ever intend to do something as gauche as truly dying, of course. Now, given your prying nature, I have work for you, as a scout. The Nightsong lends the General his strength, his invulnerability. It must be recovered, before his enemies attempt to exploit it.\nPlayer: You need my help?\nBalthazar: I do not need you, or your help. But you are here in spite of that, so I may as well make use of you. The relic is close, but the way is barred and Shar's dead are... uncooperative. Clear the path for me - by blade, cunning, or whatever it takes. I will remain here until you have succeeded, or fallen.\nShadowheart: I'd trust this gasbag about as far as I can throw him - which isn't far. But perhaps better to play along, for now.\nPlayer: You have resources to spare - give me something to aid my search.\nBalthazar: Fine. I will assign Flesh to aid you on your way. Ring this bell... ...and he will come. My brother is no intellectual powerhouse, but he is strong, loyal and punctual.

One such tome is amongst our rarest books. But enough of dusty history - I look to the future. You know I seek the Nightsong. Do you have it or not?\nPlayer: What do you want with her?\nLorroakan: 'She'. Then you do know her. You've been to Shar's temple. To the Shadowfell. You've looked upon the Nightsong's face. Tell me - and choose your next words carefully - where is she now?\nPlayer: Why do you want her so badly?\nLorroakan: I'm growing tired of this repartee, my friend. Let us cut to the chase. Beautiful, isn't it? Worth more than your life, too. I bought it from a Calishite warlock with very little of his soul left to him. It can bind a celestial to the wearer's service with a snap of the fingers. And this? This can keep her in place. Forever.\nPlayer: I know where she is. I might even be willing to tell you.\nGale: You'd give up her location, just like that? You're not actually considering betraying her, are you...?\nNightwarden Minthara: Surrendering a powerful ally to this preening wizard does not seem wise.\nHalsin: You broke Dame Aylin's shackles once before. Do not help this one to forge new ones for her.\nLorroakan: Good. Then you'll have no trouble fulfilling the contract to bring the Nightsong here.\nPlayer: Why do you want her so badly?\nLorroakan: I'm growing tired of this repartee, my friend. Let us cut to the chase. Beautiful, isn't it? Worth more than your life, too. I bought it from a Calishite warlock with very little of his soul left to him.

One should cherish all of nature's bounty... but goblin guts are quite far down the list.\nNodeContext: Hint of wry humour, Introducing himself after transforming from an owlbear and killing several goblins.\nHalsin: Not only do you speak with a bear, but you free it, too? A true friend of nature - or perhaps a lunatic. Either way, I owe thanks. I am the druid Halsin.\nPlayer: I spoke to Nettie - she said you could help me with the parasite in my head.\nHalsin: Parasite in your head...? You mean you have one of them?\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Halsin raises a hand to your head, magically connecting with you (no contact). He gives an alarmed look - he knows what’s inside you\nHalsin: Oak Father preserve you, child... You're infected, aren't you? The mind flayers' spawn. But... something's different. You're aware of the monster inside you. You don't bow to the Absolute, like the True Souls do... How is this possible...?\nPlayer: I don't know.\nHalsin: You weren't speaking lightly when you said you needed help. Let me tell you what I know. I've been studying these parasites for a while now. Ever since I discovered these so-called True Souls are infected with them. Someone is using very powerful magic to modify these tadpoles. They are using them to exert control over the infected. I'm sorry to say, I can't undo that magic, which means I can't cure you. But that doesn't mean I can't help. I didn't find what I came here for - a way to remove the tadpoles - but I found the next best thing. I found out where they come from. That must be where these enchantments are placed on them, and it's where you'll find your cure.\nPlayer: How did you come to study mind flayer parasites?\nHalsin: A drow forced me to defend myself. Afterwards, I was able to study the parasite that slithered out of the corpse, see what drives these 'True Souls'. I had no idea anyone beyond their ranks was infected. You have my sincere sympathies.\nPlayer: Sympathies won't help me to survive.\nHalsin: Patience. I can't just snap my fingers... but I know where the solution almost certainly lies. I overheard that the cultists are sending all of their captives to Moonrise Towers. Innocents go in, True Souls come out. Given that all of these True Souls are infected, it has to be the source of this magic. If you want to find a cure, you must head there and discover how the tadpoles are being manipulated.\nPlayer: Altered parasites? A cure at Moonrise Towers, maybe? Sounds like guesswork at best.\nHalsin: I'm as certain as I can be. If you have a better alternative, I won't stop you. I can't stop you, in fact. Which brings me to my next problem... I've no right to ask more of you... but if you could help me, I'd be free to join your journey to Moonrise. I cannot allow these butchers to threaten my grove. The natural order must be protected.\nPlayer: Look around you - there's no order anymore. Only chaos.\nHalsin: Chaos is welcome, in doses; it helps keep balance. But this is too much - this is unnatural. Help me kill the leaders of this horde, save my grove. Then I will help you.\n Three deaths could win us peace: the drow Minthara, the hobgoblin Dror Ragzlin, and that perversion of a priestess, Gut. They are the ones holding these parasites together. Remove them and nature will cure itself.\nPlayer: You are aware you're asking me to kill a drow?\nHalsin: You drow relish turning on your own, if there's something to be gained. Don't pretend otherwise.\nPlayer: Not all drow are as you say.\nHalsin: Unfair of me, perhaps, but I've had few encounters with drow to make me think otherwise. Perhaps you can enlighten me.\nPlayer: I'll deal with this. You get to safety.\nHalsin: There is no safety. Not while this rot festers. Once it is cut out - once the grove is secure - then I shall leave.\nPlayer: All right. Wait here until it's done.\nHalsin: May Silvanus guide your hand. Focus on the leaders - that's all it will take to restore the balance here.",

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon’s voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar. See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy. Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace. Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver. Come. Step forward. I can see the love of Shar darken your eyes. Be welcome.\nPlayer: What lesson are you teaching these sisters?\nMalus Thorm: The crux of our worship. Tell me, what is the guiding principle of the goddess?\nPlayer: Darkness.\nMalus Thorm: I profess there is another more profound.\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly. It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nLae'zel: Only a beast of a man toys with his victim. Entertaining, if not efficient.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being? If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: But you: look how the succour of Shar eludes you. See how painfully present you remain... We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: Their blades are uneven. Efficient surgery will require further training.\nMalus Thorm: Their incisions are, as yet, still streaked with imprecision - that much I must concede. How to steady their hands, I wonder.\nPlayer: Practice - that's how I got good with a blade. They should spar each other. Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\nMalus Thorm: Yes... For are we not all in need of a cure? The scalpel does not discriminate. Let each and every one of you partake in its soothing journey. Absence, sisters. Acquaint yourselves.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) Screaming and slashing, the sisters brutally murder each other.\nMalus Thorm: It is a proud moment when one sees one's teachings so lovingly taken to heart. You are to be commended for their graduation - rewarded with the promised cure. Come, I will acquaint you with the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nPlayer: I would rather acquaint myself - if you show me how.\nMalus Thorm: Your diligence is exemplary.

See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy. Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace. Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver. Come. Step forward. You are no sister, but that matters none. Every student is welcome.\nPlayer: I don't wish to study, only to lift the curse on this land.\nMalus Thorm: A curse? Nay, a cure that leads to the very pinnacle of being:\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly. It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nAstarion: He's just like Cazador - utterly insane.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being? If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: But you: look how the succour of Shar eludes you. See how painfully present you remain... We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: The sisters aren't ready. They'll make me sick instead of curing me.\nMalus Thorm: Their incisions are, as yet, still streaked with imprecision - that much I must concede. How to steady their hands, I wonder.\nPlayer: Sparring is vital to progress. Have them practice on each other. Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\nMalus Thorm: Yes... For are we not all in need of a cure? The scalpel does not discriminate. Let each and every one of you partake in its soothing journey. Absence, sisters. Acquaint yourselves.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) Screaming and slashing, the sisters brutally murder each other.\nMalus Thorm: It is a proud moment when one sees one's teachings so lovingly taken to heart. You are to be commended for their graduation - rewarded with the promised cure. Come, I will acquaint you with the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nPlayer: I would rather acquaint myself - if you show me how.\nMalus Thorm: Your diligence is exemplary.

One should cherish all of nature's bounty... but goblin guts are quite far down the list.\nNodeContext: Hint of wry humour, Introducing himself after transforming from an owlbear and killing several goblins.\nHalsin: Not only do you speak with a bear, but you free it, too? A true friend of nature - or perhaps a lunatic. Either way, I owe thanks. I am the druid Halsin.\nPlayer: I spoke to Nettie - she said you could help me with the parasite in my head.\nHalsin: Parasite in your head...? You mean you have one of them?\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Halsin raises a hand to your head, magically connecting with you (no contact). He gives an alarmed look - he knows what’s inside you\nHalsin: Oak Father preserve you, child... You're infected, aren't you? The mind flayers' spawn. But... something's different. You're aware of the monster inside you. You don't bow to the Absolute, like the True Souls do... How is this possible...?\nPlayer: I think this artefact has something to do with it.\nHalsin: Hmmm... that looks very alien. As alien as the mind flayers. They do not belong on this world. You weren't speaking lightly when you said you needed help. Let me tell you what I know. I've been studying these parasites for a while now. Ever since I discovered these so-called True Souls are infected with them. Someone is using very powerful magic to modify these tadpoles. They are using them to exert control over the infected. I'm sorry to say, I can't undo that magic, which means I can't cure you. But that doesn't mean I can't help. I didn't find what I came here for - a way to remove the tadpoles - but I found the next best thing. I found out where they come from. That must be where these enchantments are placed on them, and it's where you'll find your cure.\nPlayer: You learned all this from your studies?\nHalsin: Indeed. After we dealt with the drow that ambushed us, Nettie and I were able to inspect the corpse - and the creature that slithered out of it. I had no idea anyone beyond their ranks was infected. You have my sincere sympathies.\nPlayer: What should I do?\nHalsin: I overheard that the cultists are sending all of their captives to Moonrise Towers. Innocents go in, True Souls come out. Given that all of these True Souls are infected, it has to be the source of this magic. If you want to find a cure, you must head there and discover how the tadpoles are being manipulated.\nPlayer: Altered parasites? A cure at Moonrise Towers, maybe? Sounds like guesswork at best.\nHalsin: I'm as certain as I can be. If you have a better alternative, I won't stop you. I can't stop you, in fact. Which brings me to my next problem... I've no right to ask more of you... but if you could help me, I'd be free to join your journey to Moonrise. I cannot allow these butchers to threaten my grove. The natural order must be protected.\nPlayer: Kagha is dead. She was swayed by Shadow Druids. I had no choice.\nHalsin: Kagha... This is my fault - I was her teacher. I will mourn her when I can. But there are other matters to attend to before that. Chaos is welcome, in doses; it helps keep balance. But this is too much - this is unnatural. Help me kill the leaders of this horde, save my grove. Then I will help you.\n Three deaths could win us peace: the drow Minthara, the hobgoblin Dror Ragzlin, and that perversion of a priestess, Gut. They are the ones holding these parasites together. Remove them and nature will cure itself.\nPlayer: Having a shapeshifting bear-druid at my side might make things easier. Follow me, then. Your bear form may prove useful.\nHalsin: Be warned - my presence could make things more difficult... I can only restrain my bear form so much. I won't be able to help but attack goblins. If I join you, we'll likely have to slaughter this entire place. You may want to use discretion when approaching the goblin leaders.\nPlayer: Stay here.",

I am very glad you decided to return. A cautionary tale such as yours will be studied by Lady Shar's initiates for years to come. Always a pleasure to see old acquaintances. But you would be wise to not interfere in this matter. No matter. You are here now, to face the Dark Lady's judgement, before a gathering of your peers. Give the artefact, and perhaps we will be merciful.\nShadowheart: No. I already faced Lady Shar. I passed her trials, I wielded her spear, and now I am her mortal voice. I have been embraced by her in ways you could only dream of.\nViconia DeVir: Nonsense. Ravings. You've strayed, girl - you've failed Lady Shar's mission and allowed ambition to rot your mind.\nShadowheart: Tell her. Tell them all. Tell them how the Nightsinger has blessed me.\nPlayer: Wait. Before we go any further, tell me what this is about. Why do you even want the artefact?\nViconia DeVir: I did not consent to questions.

Whispers reached my ears from all corners - potential rivals of Lady Shar, all vying for the same prize. A new god, amassing the disaffected, the outcasts - those who should turn to us. This 'Absolute' is but an upstart; disturbing the natural order and threatening to impede the glorious return of Lady Shar's pure, endless darkness. I had to act. I had to strangle that foul conspiracy while it was still in the cradle. We learned all we could - the artefact was the one thing the Absolutists feared. The one thing they desperately wanted to keep out of their enemies' grasp. I had to have it.\nPlayer: Shar bid you to do all of this?\nViconia DeVir: Lady Shar's concerns lie elsewhere - with another. But she is a goddess... she can afford to ignore that which does not threaten her. I must keep her faith alive in mortal hearts. I must defend her ways, lead her children, stop all threats. Even if I must go against her wishes, I will prove myself her most loyal servant.\nShadowheart: You think you know better than the Dark Lady? No wonder she sent me to this place of your poison. Tell them what you witnessed. Tell them how Lady Shar favours me. Tell her. Tell them all. Tell them how the Nightsinger has blessed me.\nPlayer: I saw her walk through a shadow curse, where others feared to venture. Shar favours her.

You are deluded, girl.\nNodeContext: First part (up to 'awaits you all') addressed to Sharrans who have abandoned her. Middle (up to 'nothing more' addressed to her remaining supporters. Last part directed at shadowheart.\nShadowheart: I'm not here to convince you, Mother. You are already disgraced in Lady Shar's eyes. I merely wish to give the others a chance to repent, before they are dragged down with you.\nNarrator: *A coup attempt. Shadowheart will need all the help she can get if she's to win over the remaining diehards from Viconia's ranks.*\nPlayer: Do nothing.\nShadowheart: Viconia would have you hide down here, oblivious to the true danger - the Absolute must be stopped, and only I can lead you. Lady Shar has decreed it!\nViconia DeVir: The Absolute will be dealt with. As soon as I prise the artefact from your cold fingers. Enough talk, girl. The sooner we finish this, the sooner your blood can be sluiced off Lady Shar's sacred Grotto.\nPlayer: Give Shadowheart a chance to sway more of Viconia's followers.\nShadowheart: Enough speeches - the odds are already in my favour.

Gods, you're a sight for sore eyes. Orin told me she made a fool of you, but I should've known you wouldn't go down that easy.\nPlayer: I have no clue what you're talking about - my memories are blighted.\nLord Enver Gortash: Then she didn't lie - the past is lost to you. Let me clear up some mysteries, then. We share so much history. You and I initiated this plot. We discussed in depth the failures of our predecessors and how to avoid them. We understood that if we were to unite, no one could stand in the way of the Dead Three. So unite we did. First we obtained the crown; then we enslaved the brain. From there, it was but a small step to the most successful religious hoax ever perpetrated.\nPlayer: What was my role in this plan?\nLord Enver Gortash: In Bhaal's name, you set your bloody daggers to cause panic in the streets, killing in the Absolute's name. You would have carried out that part of the plan, had Orin not ruined your hard work. Next, the threat of the Absolute's monstrous armies formed by Myrkul's general, Ketheric Thorm. In such circumstances, people crave strong leaders. Leaders that bring law, order, and protection. Leaders like me, Bane's unyielding hand, author of justice. You are soon to witness the people of Baldur's Gate granting me complete power over them. All out of fear of the Absolute. Next, I - we - will declare curfew and begin infecting the masses. Our subjects will hear the voice of their Absolute god. The faithful will do anything in the name of their god.\nPlayer: You make me sick.\nLord Enver Gortash: Yes, yes, I'm sure I do. Now come, be witness as I make history as the first Archduke of Baldur's Gate.\nPlayer: I'd rather juice my own eyes.",

See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy. Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace. Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver. Come. Step forward. You are no sister, but that matters none. Every student is welcome.\nPlayer: What wrong has this man done to deserve such torture?\nMalus Thorm: Behold, sisters, the very face of ignorance - one who mistakes tenderness for torture. Go on. Acquaint the face of ignorance with the true object of our studies.\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly. It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nWyll: Hells. Only a monster would inflict misery and call it medicine.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being? If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: But you: look how the succour of Shar eludes you. See how painfully present you remain... We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: Their blades are uneven. Efficient surgery will require further training.\nMalus Thorm: Their incisions are, as yet, still streaked with imprecision - that much I must concede. How to steady their hands, I wonder.\nPlayer: Practice - that's how I got good with a blade. They should spar each other. Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\nMalus Thorm: Yes... For are we not all in need of a cure? The scalpel does not discriminate. Let each and every one of you partake in its soothing journey. Absence, sisters. Acquaint yourselves.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) Screaming and slashing, the sisters brutally murder each other.\nMalus Thorm: It is a proud moment when one sees one's teachings so lovingly taken to heart. You are to be commended for their graduation - rewarded with the promised cure. Come, I will acquaint you with the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nPlayer: I am not worthy! Please, show me how a master works - I would be honoured. I would rather acquaint myself - if you show me how.\nMalus Thorm: Your diligence is exemplary. Very well: your own scalpel you will be.

Her hands are in a prayer position and she's chanting softly as the moonlight dances around her. She exhales, then inhales and breaths in tendrils of shadow, absorbing them. She swallows, then begins hacking coughing. The moonlight dissipates. She quickly goes from seeming like a divine spirit to a normal young woman.\nIsobel: I didn't realise I had an audience.\nFist Marcus: Isobel. This is -\nIsobel: A Sharran.\nNarrator: *Isobel. The same name as Ketheric Thorm's daughter - the one whose sarcophagus you found empty in the family mausoleum.*\nPlayer: Push your Urges down. This Sharran exposed a traitor in your midst.\nIsobel: Fair. I admit, Marcus waltzing around the place undetected bodes rather ill for our defences, doesn't it? Then again, the best defence is a good offence. Frankly, I'm surprised you're willing to help us. Your kind aren't known for their decency - particularly when a Sharran curse is our greatest obstacle. But if you are who I think you are, I'd be a fool to reject your help. The True Soul with... well, a soul. Imagine.\nPlayer: I won't be spoken to like that by a Selûnite.\nIsobel: We've both got a bitter pill to swallow. When this is all over, we can spit it back out. You'll be needing the protection spell, I presume? Oh - aren't you looking for a protection spell?\nPlayer: Nod. Better to humour her than make an enemy of all in this place. Lady Shar will understand.\nIsobel: Refreshingly pragmatic of you. I sense Shar has offered some amount of protection to you already, but... well, no harm in extra precaution - even from a Selûnite.\nNarrator: *Pain bursts from the wound on your hand. You see yourself kneeling in a dark hall, surrounded by initiates. A female voice preaches against Selûne and all she stands for. You nod, rapt.*\nInternalNodeContext: Incurable wound imagery/memoriy fragment\nIsobel: Well! If the Moonmaiden didn't strike me dead for blessing you, she must rather approve of this little alliance. This will block the lesser effects of the shadow curse, allowing you to traverse the darkness outside... should Shar's own protection falter, that is. Curious. Surely the Nightsinger could have shielded all her followers, and made this place her domain long ago... yet she only acts now, and aids you alone. I wonder why.\nPlayer: I don't know what to make of it myself.\nIsobel: I suppose Shar is nothing if not mysterious. I'll stop needling you, though. You have more important things to do, after all.\nPlayer: I do, though I already have a Moonlantern. I already have a Moonlantern. I can safely travel the shadows.\nIsobel: Well! Now you have two. Just in case. I wish you luck. The very best of it.\nPlayer: Wait - Marcus is a True Soul, you know. And not the good kind, like me.",

He gives an alarmed look - he knows what’s inside you\nHalsin: Oak Father preserve you, child... You're infected, aren't you? The mind flayers' spawn. But... something's different. You're aware of the monster inside you. You don't bow to the Absolute, like the True Souls do... How is this possible...?\nPlayer: I think this artefact has something to do with it.\nHalsin: Hmmm... that looks very alien. As alien as the mind flayers. They do not belong on this world. You weren't speaking lightly when you said you needed help. Let me tell you what I know. I've been studying these parasites for a while now. Ever since I discovered these so-called True Souls are infected with them. Someone is using very powerful magic to modify these tadpoles. They are using them to exert control over the infected. I'm sorry to say, I can't undo that magic, which means I can't cure you. But that doesn't mean I can't help. I didn't find what I came here for - a way to remove the tadpoles - but I found the next best thing. I found out where they come from. That must be where these enchantments are placed on them, and it's where you'll find your cure.\nPlayer: Tell me what you've learned about the tadpoles' origins.\nHalsin: I overheard that the cultists are sending all of their captives to Moonrise Towers. Innocents go in, True Souls come out. Given that all of these True Souls are infected, it has to be the source of this magic. If you want to find a cure, you must head there and discover how the tadpoles are being manipulated.\nPlayer: Altered parasites? A cure at Moonrise Towers, maybe? Sounds like guesswork at best.\nHalsin: I'm as certain as I can be. If you have a better alternative, I won't stop you. I can't stop you, in fact. Which brings me to my next problem... I've no right to ask more of you... but if you could help me, I'd be free to join your journey to Moonrise. I cannot allow these butchers to threaten my grove. The natural order must be protected.\nPlayer: Look around you - there's no order anymore. Only chaos.\nHalsin: Chaos is welcome, in doses; it helps keep balance. But this is too much - this is unnatural. Help me kill the leaders of this horde, save my grove. Then I will help you.\n Three deaths could win us peace: the drow Minthara, the hobgoblin Dror Ragzlin, and that perversion of a priestess, Gut. They are the ones holding these parasites together. Remove them and nature will cure itself.\nPlayer: You are aware you're asking me to kill a drow?\nHalsin: You drow relish turning on your own, if there's something to be gained. Don't pretend otherwise.\nPlayer: Not all drow are as you say.\nHalsin: Unfair of me, perhaps, but I've had few encounters with drow to make me think otherwise. Perhaps you can enlighten me.\nPlayer: Having a shapeshifting bear-druid at my side might make things easier. Follow me, then. Your bear form may prove useful.\nHalsin: Be warned - my presence could make things more difficult... I can only restrain my bear form so much. I won't be able to help but attack goblins. If I join you, we'll likely have to slaughter this entire place. You may want to use discretion when approaching the goblin leaders.\nPlayer: Stay here.",

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon’s voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar. See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy. Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace. Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver. Come. Step forward. I can see the love of Shar darken your eyes. Be welcome.\nPlayer: May Shar guide your blessing hands.\nMalus Thorm: And the rough vessels that are yours. Tell me, what is the guiding principle of the goddess?\nPlayer: Secrecy.\nMalus Thorm: I profess there is another more profound.\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly. It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nShadowheart: A stinging truth - but a truth nonetheless.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being? If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: You are well on your way. But one white orb disfigures you still. Let us finish the cure. We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: Their blades are uneven. Efficient surgery will require further training.\nMalus Thorm: Their incisions are, as yet, still streaked with imprecision - that much I must concede. How to steady their hands, I wonder.\nPlayer: Sparring is vital to progress. Have them practice on each other. Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\nMalus Thorm: Yes... For are we not all in need of a cure? The scalpel does not discriminate. Let each and every one of you partake in its soothing journey. Absence, sisters. Acquaint yourselves.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) Screaming and slashing, the sisters brutally murder each other.\nMalus Thorm: It is a proud moment when one sees one's teachings so lovingly taken to heart. You are to be commended for their graduation - rewarded with the promised cure. Come, I will acquaint you with the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nPlayer: I am not worthy! Please, show me how a master works - I would be honoured. I would rather acquaint myself - if you show me how.\nMalus Thorm: Your diligence is exemplary. Very well: your own scalpel you will be.

Forgive me, but that look in your eyes - something terrible has happened to you.\nPlayer: Clever man. How did you know?\nAbdirak: Because I see those same eyes when I look in the mirror, dear one. We've all suffered in these dark times. It is little wonder you bear scars of pain and anguish. Please let me alleviate this pain.\nPlayer: And how would you do that?\nAbdirak: As the Maiden of Pain, the goddess Loviatar, teaches us... ...through penance - administered by my skilled hand.

Expect dangers like you've never seen before.\nPlayer: I'm something of an expert when it comes to imperilling myself.\nHalsin: This is different. There's more fingers on a hand than there are survivors of that place.\nPlayer: I think you're exaggerating. You just want me to stay and help you.\nHalsin: I do want you to help me, yes. But I am not exaggerating. To get to the Towers, you'll need to pass through a terrible place - a cursed place. This curse shrouds everything in shadow - you will not find life, light, or anything natural there. Any who linger are twisted by the curse; they become shadow beings - tormented, dangerous souls.\nPlayer: What do you suggest?\nHalsin: You could go overland - along the Risen Road or through the mountains. Easier at first, but you'll run into the shadow curse eventually. You could also go under. There is a tunnel somewhere in this very temple of Selûne. It leads to Moonrise Towers through the Underdark. Long ago, a man called Ketheric Thorm built a secret stronghold deep down there, before rallying a whole army of Dark Justiciars - Shar worshippers.\nShadowheart: Dark Justiciars? I must see for myself.\nHalsin: Aradin and his lot were looking for a way down there - they were promised riches if they retrieved a relic called the Nightsong. But I think there's more. From this stronghold, Ketheric's forces could access both the temple of Selûne and Moonrise Towers - but he was defeated before he could launch an attack. If you can find this place, I'll wager it will reveal a more direct path to Moonrise Towers, and may bypass the worst of the shadow curse.\nPlayer: The Underdark's my home. Better to take that route than risk this curse.\nHalsin: Anything is preferable to risking the shadow curse. You may reconsider once you see the effects of the curse for yourself.\nPlayer: I may live to regret this - or maybe I won't - but fine, I'll help you save the grove first.\nHalsin: You will? Oak Father bless you. I'll be in your debt twice over if we succeed. You know what's needed - the deaths of Dror Ragzlin, the drow Minthara, and the priestess, Gut. May nature guide you. I could come and help you... but be warned - I won't be able to suppress my animal side. Subtlety will not be an option. If I join you, we'll likely have to slaughter this entire place.

We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: What brought you here?\nZevlor: We're refugees from Elturel - we took shelter here after goblins and gnolls attacked us on the road. We were bound for Baldur's Gate, and it was too late to turn back. Elturel had no place for tieflings after the Descent.\nNarrator: *You remember it. Elturel and all its citizens were dragged into Avernus - then back out again.*\nPlayer: Let me guess: Your old neighbours called you 'devilkin' and acted like they never knew you.\nZevlor: How easily such a nasty word slips through the mouth of someone you thought you knew. We thought we'd found sanctuary here, but the druids have determined to turn us out. We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: What brought you here?\nZevlor: We're refugees from Elturel - we took shelter here after goblins and gnolls attacked us on the road. We were bound for Baldur's Gate, and it was too late to turn back. Elturel had no place for tieflings after the Descent.\nPlayer: 'The Descent'? What is that?\nZevlor: I'm surprised you haven't heard of it. The High Overseer - our grand protector - signed a pact with devils. It dragged Elturel straight to Hell. Lucky for us, a group of adventurers found a way to bring the city back. Afterwards, people looked at us and just saw 'devilkin'. No different from the druids here, really. We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: Leave.",

Her hands are in a prayer position and she's chanting softly as the moonlight dances around her. She exhales, then inhales and breaths in tendrils of shadow, absorbing them. She swallows, then begins hacking coughing. The moonlight dissipates. She quickly goes from seeming like a divine spirit to a normal young woman.\nIsobel: I didn't realise I had an audience.\nFist Marcus: Isobel. This is -\nIsobel: A Sharran.\nNarrator: *Isobel. The same name as Ketheric Thorm's daughter - the one whose sarcophagus you found empty in the family mausoleum.*\nPlayer: Push your Urges down. Isobel - Isobel Thorm?\nNarrator: *Her breath catches; you notice a barely-perceptible shudder run through her body.*\nIsobel: An unfortunate coincidence. I hope never to meet the wicked man who haemorrhaged shadows over this peaceful village. I've heard you might be the person to stop him. A True Soul with a soul. Imagine. But if you are who I think you are, I'd be a fool to reject your help. The True Soul with... well, a soul. Imagine.\nPlayer: I may have the parasite of a True Soul, but not the mind of one.\nIsobel: And that's what makes you essential. You'll be needing the protection spell, I presume? Oh - aren't you looking for a protection spell?\nPlayer: I need nothing from a Selûnite.\nIsobel: But any others who travel with you may not agree. Do it for them at least - you will need all the help you can get out there.\nPlayer: It was nothing. Put it out of your mind.\nNarrator: *But was it truly nothing? The pain gripped you tight, robbing you of all composure for a moment...*\nIsobel: Well! If the Moonmaiden didn't strike me dead for blessing you, she must rather approve of this little alliance. This will block the lesser effects of the shadow curse, allowing you to traverse the darkness outside... should Shar's own protection falter, that is. It won't be enough to protect you against areas of utter darkness, though - where the curse is strongest. This lantern should, though.\nPlayer: I already have a Moonlantern. I can safely travel the shadows.\nIsobel: Well! Now you have two. Just in case. I wish you luck. The very best of it.\nPlayer: Wait - Marcus is a True Soul, you know.

I am very glad you decided to return. A cautionary tale such as yours will be studied by Lady Shar's initiates for years to come. Always a pleasure to see old acquaintances. But you would be wise to not interfere in this matter. No matter. You are here now, to face the Dark Lady's judgement, before a gathering of your peers. Give the artefact, and perhaps we will be merciful.\nShadowheart: No. I already faced Lady Shar. I passed her trials, I wielded her spear, and now I am her mortal voice. I have been embraced by her in ways you could only dream of.\nViconia DeVir: Nonsense. Ravings. You've strayed, girl - you've failed Lady Shar's mission and allowed ambition to rot your mind.\nShadowheart: Tell her. Tell them all. Tell them how the Nightsinger has blessed me.\nPlayer: Wait. Before we go any further, tell me what this is about. Why do you even want the artefact?\nViconia DeVir: I did not consent to questions. But I suppose you have undergone a great deal to reach this place, and anything I tell you cannot compromise me now - for you will either leave on my terms, or not at all... Whispers reached my ears from all corners - potential rivals of Lady Shar, all vying for the same prize. A new god, amassing the disaffected, the outcasts - those who should turn to us. This 'Absolute' is but an upstart; disturbing the natural order and threatening to impede the glorious return of Lady Shar's pure, endless darkness. I had to act. I had to strangle that foul conspiracy while it was still in the cradle. We learned all we could - the artefact was the one thing the Absolutists feared.

You are here now, to face the Dark Lady's judgement, before a gathering of your peers. Give the artefact, and perhaps we will be merciful.\nShadowheart: No. I already faced Lady Shar. I passed her trials, I wielded her spear, and now I am her mortal voice. I have been embraced by her in ways you could only dream of.\nViconia DeVir: Nonsense. Ravings.

This 'Absolute' is but an upstart; disturbing the natural order and threatening to impede the glorious return of Lady Shar's pure, endless darkness. I had to act. I had to strangle that foul conspiracy while it was still in the cradle. We learned all we could - the artefact was the one thing the Absolutists feared. The one thing they desperately wanted to keep out of their enemies' grasp. I had to have it.\nPlayer: Shar bid you to do all of this?\nViconia DeVir: Lady Shar's concerns lie elsewhere - with another. But she is a goddess... she can afford to ignore that which does not threaten her. I must keep her faith alive in mortal hearts. I must defend her ways, lead her children, stop all threats. Even if I must go against her wishes, I will prove myself her most loyal servant.\nShadowheart: You think you know better than the Dark Lady? No wonder she sent me to this place of your poison.

Now, do not be so foolish as to attack me. Unlike before, I am flesh and blood - but am very well protected.\nJaheira: You've finally found yourself a following, Mother Superior. And you only had to hollow out their heads to do it.\nMinsc: Pin your eyes to the treacherous she-drow. Do not focus on the many, many others - Boo will handle them.\nViconia DeVir: Always a pleasure to see old acquaintances. But you would be wise to not interfere in this matter. No matter. You are here now, to face the Dark Lady's judgement, before a gathering of your peers. Give the artefact, and perhaps we will be merciful.\nShadowheart: No. I already faced Lady Shar. I passed her trials, I wielded her spear, and now I am her mortal voice. I have been embraced by her in ways you could only dream of.\nViconia DeVir: Nonsense. Ravings. You've strayed, girl - you've failed Lady Shar's mission and allowed ambition to rot your mind.\nShadowheart: Tell her. Tell them all. Tell them how the Nightsinger has blessed me.\nPlayer: Wait. Before we go any further, tell me what this is about. Why do you even want the artefact?\nViconia DeVir: I did not consent to questions. But I suppose you have undergone a great deal to reach this place, and anything I tell you cannot compromise me now - for you will either leave on my terms, or not at all... Whispers reached my ears from all corners - potential rivals of Lady Shar, all vying for the same prize. A new god, amassing the disaffected, the outcasts - those who should turn to us. This 'Absolute' is but an upstart; disturbing the natural order and threatening to impede the glorious return of Lady Shar's pure, endless darkness. I had to act. I had to strangle that foul conspiracy while it was still in the cradle. We learned all we could - the artefact was the one thing the Absolutists feared. The one thing they desperately wanted to keep out of their enemies' grasp. I had to have it.\nPlayer: You thought you could best the Absolute? The githyanki?\nViconia DeVir: To fight so many foes openly could prove unwise. Shar's children are better deployed as daggers in the shadows, not massed upon a battlefield. So let the others fight, while we wait. Once they are spent and bloodied from each other, we would slip in and take the prize. Alas, most of those I sent, perished. All but one.\nShadowheart: Lady Shar protected me. She guided me, elevated me. And now she wants me to cast you down. Tell them what you witnessed. Tell them how Lady Shar favours me. Tell her. Tell them all. Tell them how the Nightsinger has blessed me.\nPlayer: It's true. She survived the Gauntlet of Shar. She sacrificed Selûne's own daughter. She is your rightful leader. It's true. She survived the Gauntlet of Shar. She sacrificed Selûne's own daughter.
