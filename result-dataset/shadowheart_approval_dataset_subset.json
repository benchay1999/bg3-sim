You know you could turn - just like that.\nGROUP_Act1_GLO_HagHuman: What do you say? Want me to take care of the little bugger?\nPlayer: Such things are rarely done for free. What's the real bargain here?\nGROUP_Act1_GLO_HagHuman: You're a sharp one. I am proposing a deal, but it's different from your little pact. You see, I prefer personal things.\nGROUP_Act1_GLO_HagHuman: One of your pretty little peepers.\nGROUP_Act1_GLO_HagHuman: I'll pluck it from your head, kiss it for luck, then back in it goes.

My Lady Shar's spear.\nShadowheart: Her fate is mine to seal. Let me handle this.\nNightsong: The fate you seal is your own. To be a Dark Justiciar is to turn your heart from everything but loss. You will know no love, no joy - only servitude.\nNightsong: Until, of course, your mistress inevitably discards you. And there is much she does not tell you - a terrible blood price that may extend beyond my own death.\nNarrator: *You feel Shadowheart bristling - this is important to her. Any attempts to dissuade her from doing her duty will be a damning blow to your bond.*\nNarrator: *And Nightsong is not blind to your conflict.

You should be pleased.\nBalthazar: I take it the breaking of my skeletons was an accident - the living are so clumsy, after all.\nPlayer: I'm pleased to be of service, Balthazar.\nBalthazar: Perhaps you can prove to me that you're more useful alive than dead. You know what's at stake here, I take it?\nBalthazar: But you're here now, and I may be able to put those limbs to work. You know what's at stake here, I take it?\nPlayer: Z'rell spoke of a relic - something called the Nightsong in your notes. They were very interesting.\nPlayer: Yet you seem no closer to retrieving the Nightsong? I read your notes - very interesting.\nBalthazar: Interesting, and private. Give me one reason why I shouldn't have my creations kill you right now, thief.\nPlayer: Touch me, and I'll strike you down with all of nature's fang and fury. Go ahead - try me.\nPlayer: You're hiding from shadows - literally. Don't make threats you can't back up.\n: True\nBalthazar: ...Fine. I'll forgive your transgressions this time - there are much grander things at stake.\nNodeContext: A pause before 'fine' - weighing up the player's fate.\nBalthazar: The Nightsong is my finest creation - if I never exceed myself, I will still die happy. Not that I ever intend to do something as gauche as truly dying, of course.\nBalthazar: Now, given your prying nature, I have work for you, as a scout.\nBalthazar: The Nightsong lends the General his strength, his invulnerability. It must be recovered, before his enemies attempt to exploit it.\nPlayer: You need my help?\nBalthazar: I do not need you, or your help. But you are here in spite of that, so I may as well make use of you.\nBalthazar: The Nightsong is close, but the way is barred and Shar's dead are... uncooperative. Clear the path for me - by blade, cunning, or whatever it takes.\nBalthazar: I will remain here until you have succeeded, or fallen.\nShadowheart: I'd trust this gasbag about as far as I can throw him - which isn't far. But perhaps better to play along, for now.\nPlayer: For jobs like this it's good form to provide your operatives some extra resources.\n: True\nBalthazar: Fine. I will assign Flesh to aid you on your way. Ring this bell...\nBalthazar: ...and he will come.\nBalthazar: My brother is no intellectual powerhouse, but he is strong, loyal and punctual.

Are you feeling all right?\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: Halsin raises a hand to your head, magically connecting with you (no contact). He gives an alarmed look - he knows what’s inside you\nHalsin: Oak Father preserve you, child... You're infected, aren't you? The mind flayers' spawn.\nHalsin: But... something's different. You're aware of the monster inside you. You don't bow to the Absolute, like the True Souls do...\nHalsin: How is this possible...?\nPlayer: I escaped from an illithid ship after being infected. Maybe the process was interrupted.\nHalsin: Perhaps... but I wouldn't want to place all my faith in blind luck.\nHalsin: You weren't speaking lightly when you said you needed help. Let me tell you what I know.\nHalsin: I've been studying these parasites for a while now. Ever since I discovered these so-called True Souls are infected with them.\nHalsin: Someone is using very powerful magic to modify these tadpoles. They are using them to exert control over the infected.\nHalsin: I'm sorry to say, I can't undo that magic, which means I can't cure you. But that doesn't mean I can't help.\nHalsin: I didn't find what I came here for - a way to remove the tadpoles - but I found the next best thing. I found out where they come from.\nHalsin: That must be where these enchantments are placed on them, and it's where you'll find your cure.\nPlayer: You learned all this from your studies?\nHalsin: Indeed. After we dealt with the drow that ambushed us, Nettie and I were able to inspect the corpse - and the creature that slithered out of it.\nHalsin: I had no idea anyone beyond their ranks was infected. You have my sincere sympathies.\nPlayer: What should I do?\nHalsin: I overheard that the cultists are sending all of their captives to Moonrise Towers.\nHalsin: Innocents go in, True Souls come out. Given that all of these True Souls are infected, it has to be the source of this magic.\nHalsin: If you want to find a cure, you must head there and discover how the tadpoles are being manipulated.\nPlayer: You seem to know a lot about this. Will you come with me to Moonrise?\nHalsin: I wish I could, but there's still work I've yet to finish - blood I've yet to spill.\nHalsin: I've no right to ask more of you... but if you could help me, I'd be free to join your journey to Moonrise.\nHalsin: I cannot allow these butchers to threaten my grove. The natural order must be protected.\nPlayer: Look around you - there's no order anymore. Only chaos.\nHalsin: Chaos is welcome, in doses; it helps keep balance. But this is too much - this is unnatural.\nHalsin: It's too late to merely kill this horde's leadership - their forces are already marching. If you want me to help, you need to help me first.\nHalsin: You must get ahead of them, muster the defences.\nPlayer: You ask too much of me. I can't help you.",

One of our most reliable contractors, though unfortunately this particular request was too much even for her.\nHavkelaag: I believe she quite lost her senses over the task. She came here insisting I purchase an owlbear egg from her, of all things.\nHavkelaag: I don't suppose you've stumbled across any githyanki eggs during your travels? The Society will compensate you for any we purchase, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nHavkelaag: Would you consider parting with it?

Don't you dare consider it.\nPlayer: What are you going to do with it?\nHavkelaag: Study it, of course. The githyanki have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months.\nHavkelaag: You are no doubt aware that citizens of the Underdark are held in great suspicion by those who live above ground. Many believe us to be 'evil'.\nHavkelaag: The githyanki face similar prejudice, but I believe, if hatched in a less violent, more intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome its evil predispositions.\nHavkelaag: I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: You're letting your personal biases affect your method. Why assume they're evil?\nHavkelaag: I assume nothing. Innate githyanki cruelty is an established fact - no doubt you witnessed it yourself in the retrieval of the egg itself.\nHavkelaag: When I have a suitable sample for my study, I will, however, prove that the effects of their biological inclination are reversible.\nHavkelaag: Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach:\nHavkelaag: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue.\nHavkelaag: Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: So you're planning to torture a child for a year?\nHavkelaag: The child will be a better individual after my treatment than it ever would have been had it been raised in its natural environment.\nHavkelaag: Any suffering it endures will therefore be worth it, for the child, perhaps for the whole of civilised society.\nHavkelaag: My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: And what if your experiment fails?\nHavkelaag: If the child remains evil after the experiment is concluded, it will be destroyed. Such is the fate of all used specimens.\nHavkelaag: Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg? ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: A gith hatchling is not a lab rat! This shka'keth should be bled dry for the mere suggestion.\nPlayer: Sell the egg.\nHavkelaag: Ah.

Would you be interested in studying it?\nHavkelaag: A githyanki egg? What a fortuitous turn of events. I've been attempting to get my hands on one for some time now.\nHavkelaag: Would you consider parting with it? The Society's coffers are deep enough to cover any expenses accrued in its retrieval, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: Chk. Don't you dare consider it.\nPlayer: What are you going to do with it?\nHavkelaag: Study it, of course. Your kind have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months.\nHavkelaag: Most on this plane believe you to be innately cruel, violent beings. Evil, if you will.\nHavkelaag: As citizens of the Underdark, we face similar stigmas. Totally unfounded, of course - our natures are as unfixed as any who walk the surface.\nHavkelaag: I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: You're letting your personal biases affect your method. Why assume they're evil?\nHavkelaag: I assume nothing. Innate githyanki cruelty is an established fact - no doubt you witnessed it yourself in the retrieval of the egg itself.\nHavkelaag: When I have a suitable sample for my study, I will, however, prove that the effects of their biological inclination are reversible.\nHavkelaag: Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach:\nHavkelaag: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue.\nHavkelaag: Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: That kind of indoctrination and time-forced nurture violates the natural order. It invalidates the whole experiment.\nHavkelaag: I won't bother to argue with you. An arboreal shaman can't be expected to understand the rigorous protocols of theoretical research.\nHavkelaag: My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: Your findings are irrelevant, as are the opinions of all on this kaincha plane.\nHavkelaag: Ah. A display of the well-known githyanki arrogance. I am not sure my experiment can cure that particular affliction, but give me time and I will find a way.\nHavkelaag: Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg? ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: A gith hatchling is not a lab rat! This shka'keth should be bled dry for the mere suggestion.\nPlayer: Sell the egg.\nHavkelaag: Ah. Unfortunately, it seems I've mislaid my purse.\nHavkelaag: I don't suppose you'd consider simply donating it to the Society instead?\nPlayer: Fine. Here you go.",

Regretting it yet?\nWulbren Bongle: I spent a lot of time thinking of worst case scenarios while I was locked in that cell you plucked me out of at Moonrise.\nWulbren Bongle: I didn't imagine anything as bad as this. The Gondians have handed Enver Gortash the means to bring about the end of liberty in Baldur's Gate.\nWulbren Bongle: And the citizens have rolled out the red carpet for their new tyrant.\nWulbren Bongle: Resistance fighters are few and far between - my Ironhands, what's left of the Harpers, and you. I hope.\nPlayer: I'm with you.\nWulbren Bongle: Good. We don't have a chance unless we stick together - not while the Gondians' metal monsters are patrolling the streets.\nWulbren Bongle: The Steel Watch. They're a threat to you, me - and every man, woman and child in the city.\nWulbren Bongle: They act all civilised... servants of the people. But they only serve one man.\nWulbren Bongle: When he becomes Grand Duke, it will only get worse. Laws will change, freedoms will vanish, and soon you'll be accused and sentenced before you've even committed a crime.\nWulbren Bongle: And the fucking Gondians are to blame for all of it.\nPlayer: Cheer up Wulbren. We're here to help.\nWulbren Bongle: I heard about that. You had the Harpers all excited, but there aren't many Harpers left.\nWulbren Bongle: These Steel Watchers. One of them is the equivalent of a red dragon. An army of them, well... there's never been an army of dragons.\nPlayer: I'm not quite an army of dragons, but I'm the closest thing you'll probably find.\nWulbren Bongle: Even a mountain of magic wouldn't be enough to stop those behemoths. No, there's only one way of stopping the Steel Watch.\nWulbren Bongle: By hitting the Gondians. Hard.\nWulbren Bongle: They invented the Steel Watchers. And they're building an army of them.\nWulbren Bongle: They've always been happy to provide their technology to despots in exchange for a stipend and the freedom to work in peace.\nWulbren Bongle: They would have licked Sarevok's boots given the chance, and now they'll kiss Gortash's ring while the city screams.\nWulbren Bongle: I had a plan to put a stop to them. But the way things are now, if we stick our heads above ground, the Watchers are on us like flies on shit.\nPlayer: What was the plan?\nWulbren Bongle: Same as it always is. Eliminate the threat.\nWulbren Bongle: In this case - the foundry where these atrocities are produced.\nWulbren Bongle: The Gondians are ingenious. But we're more than equal to them - there's nothing they can build that the Ironhands can't tear down.\nWulbren Bongle: I've built something unique for just that purpose.\nWulbren Bongle: A runepowder bomb - first of its kind. Fifty wizards high on the Weave couldn't summon this kind of firepower.\nWulbren Bongle: Get the bomb inside the Gondian facility, and - boom. Problem solved.\nBarcus Wroot: Wulbren, please. This is too far! Everyone in the foundry would be killed.\nWulbren Bongle: Quiet, Barcus. The adults are talking.\nPlayer: Maybe the Gondians are victims, not oppressors.\nWulbren Bongle: The Gondians picked their side the minute they took orders from Gortash.\nWulbren Bongle: If they had any courage, they'd have refused him and died like heroes, spitting in his face.\nWulbren Bongle: Now they'll die like the dogs they are.\nPlayer: Gortash is the enemy - not the Gondians.

One of our most reliable contractors, though unfortunately this particular request was too much even for her.\nHavkelaag: I believe she quite lost her senses over the task.

The Society will compensate you for any we purchase, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nHavkelaag: Would you consider parting with it?

Don't you dare consider it.\nPlayer: What are you going to do with it?\nHavkelaag: Study it, of course. The githyanki have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months.\nHavkelaag: You yourself have no doubt experienced the prejudice of those who assume that, as beings of the Underdark, we are inherently evil.\nHavkelaag: The githyanki face similar prejudice, but I believe, if hatched in a less violent, more intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome its evil predispositions.\nHavkelaag: I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: So the child inside will be experimented on?\nHavkelaag: Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach:\nHavkelaag: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue.\nHavkelaag: Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: So you're planning to torture a child for a year?\nHavkelaag: The child will be a better individual after my treatment than it ever would have been had it been raised in its natural environment.\nHavkelaag: Any suffering it endures will therefore be worth it, for the child, perhaps for the whole of civilised society.\nHavkelaag: My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: Sounds pointless. Public opinion will hardly be swayed by such a small experiment.\nHavkelaag: Not at first. But if the experiment proves successful, it must be repeated. Only then will we know if the findings are to be trusted.\nHavkelaag: Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg? ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: A gith hatchling is not a lab rat! This shka'keth should be bled dry for the mere suggestion.\nPlayer: Sell the egg.\nHavkelaag: Ah. Unfortunately, it seems I've mislaid my purse.\nHavkelaag: I don't suppose you'd consider simply donating it to the Society instead?\nPlayer: Fine. Here you go.",

Let me tell you what I know.\nHalsin: I've been studying these parasites for a while now. Ever since I discovered these so-called True Souls are infected with them.\nHalsin: Someone is using very powerful magic to modify these tadpoles. They are using them to exert control over the infected.\nHalsin: I'm sorry to say, I can't undo that magic, which means I can't cure you. But that doesn't mean I can't help.\nHalsin: I didn't find what I came here for - a way to remove the tadpoles - but I found the next best thing. I found out where they come from.\nHalsin: That must be where these enchantments are placed on them, and it's where you'll find your cure.\nPlayer: How did you come to study mind flayer parasites?\nHalsin: A drow forced me to defend myself. Afterwards, I was able to study the parasite that slithered out of the corpse, see what drives these 'True Souls'.\nHalsin: I had no idea anyone beyond their ranks was infected. You have my sincere sympathies.\nPlayer: Sympathies won't help me to survive.\nHalsin: Patience. I can't just snap my fingers... but I know where the solution almost certainly lies.\nHalsin: I overheard that the cultists are sending all of their captives to Moonrise Towers.\nHalsin: Innocents go in, True Souls come out. Given that all of these True Souls are infected, it has to be the source of this magic.\nHalsin: If you want to find a cure, you must head there and discover how the tadpoles are being manipulated.\nPlayer: Altered parasites? A cure at Moonrise Towers, maybe? Sounds like guesswork at best.\nHalsin: I'm as certain as I can be. If you have a better alternative, I won't stop you.\nHalsin: I can't stop you, in fact. Which brings me to my next problem...\nHalsin: I've no right to ask more of you... but if you could help me, I'd be free to join your journey to Moonrise.\nHalsin: I cannot allow these butchers to threaten my grove. The natural order must be protected.\nPlayer: All right. How do I help?\nHalsin: My thanks. If you prevail, I'll owe you the debt of a lifetime.\nHalsin: Rare is the beast that survives decapitation. Help me eliminate the drow Minthara, the hobgoblin Dror Ragzlin, and that perversion of a priestess, Gut.\nHalsin: They are the ones holding these parasites together. Remove them and nature will cure itself.\nPlayer: You ask too much of me. I can't help you.",

Will you come with me to Moonrise?\nHalsin: I wish I could, but there's still work I've yet to finish - blood I've yet to spill.\nHalsin: I've no right to ask more of you... but if you could help me, I'd be free to join your journey to Moonrise.\nHalsin: I cannot allow these butchers to threaten my grove.

But this is too much - this is unnatural.\nHalsin: It's too late to merely kill this horde's leadership - their forces are already marching.

He gives an alarmed look - he knows what’s inside you\nHalsin: Oak Father preserve you, child... You're infected, aren't you? The mind flayers' spawn.\nHalsin: But... something's different. You're aware of the monster inside you. You don't bow to the Absolute, like the True Souls do...\nHalsin: How is this possible...?\nPlayer: I don't know.\nHalsin: You weren't speaking lightly when you said you needed help. Let me tell you what I know.\nHalsin: I've been studying these parasites for a while now. Ever since I discovered these so-called True Souls are infected with them.\nHalsin: Someone is using very powerful magic to modify these tadpoles. They are using them to exert control over the infected.\nHalsin: I'm sorry to say, I can't undo that magic, which means I can't cure you. But that doesn't mean I can't help.\nHalsin: I didn't find what I came here for - a way to remove the tadpoles - but I found the next best thing. I found out where they come from.\nHalsin: That must be where these enchantments are placed on them, and it's where you'll find your cure.\nPlayer: So all of this was for nothing.\nHalsin: Patience. I can't just snap my fingers... but I know where the solution almost certainly lies.\nHalsin: I overheard that the cultists are sending all of their captives to Moonrise Towers.\nHalsin: Innocents go in, True Souls come out. Given that all of these True Souls are infected, it has to be the source of this magic.\nHalsin: If you want to find a cure, you must head there and discover how the tadpoles are being manipulated.\nPlayer: You seem to know a lot about this. Will you come with me to Moonrise?\nHalsin: I wish I could, but there's still work I've yet to finish - blood I've yet to spill.\nHalsin: I've no right to ask more of you... but if you could help me, I'd be free to join your journey to Moonrise.\nHalsin: I cannot allow these butchers to threaten my grove. The natural order must be protected.\nPlayer: Kagha is dead. She was swayed by Shadow Druids. I had no choice.\nHalsin: Kagha... This is my fault - I was her teacher. I will mourn her when I can.\nHalsin: But there are other matters to attend to before that.\nHalsin: Chaos is welcome, in doses; it helps keep balance. But this is too much - this is unnatural.\nHalsin: Help me kill the leaders of this horde, save my grove. Then I will help you.\n\nHalsin: Three deaths could win us peace: the drow Minthara, the hobgoblin Dror Ragzlin, and that perversion of a priestess, Gut.\nHalsin: They are the ones holding these parasites together. Remove them and nature will cure itself.\nPlayer: You ask too much of me. I can't help you.",

One of our most reliable contractors, though unfortunately this particular request was too much even for her.\nHavkelaag: I believe she quite lost her senses over the task. She came here insisting I purchase an owlbear egg from her, of all things.\nHavkelaag: I don't suppose you've stumbled across any githyanki eggs during your travels?

Don't you dare consider it.\nPlayer: What are you going to do with it?\nHavkelaag: Study it, of course. The githyanki have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months.\nHavkelaag: You are no doubt aware that citizens of the Underdark are held in great suspicion by those who live above ground. Many believe us to be 'evil'.\nHavkelaag: The githyanki face similar prejudice, but I believe, if hatched in a less violent, more intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome its evil predispositions.\nHavkelaag: I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: You're letting your personal biases affect your method. Why assume they're evil?\nHavkelaag: I assume nothing. Innate githyanki cruelty is an established fact - no doubt you witnessed it yourself in the retrieval of the egg itself.\nHavkelaag: When I have a suitable sample for my study, I will, however, prove that the effects of their biological inclination are reversible.\nHavkelaag: Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach:\nHavkelaag: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue.\nHavkelaag: Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: So you're planning to torture a child for a year?\nHavkelaag: The child will be a better individual after my treatment than it ever would have been had it been raised in its natural environment.\nHavkelaag: Any suffering it endures will therefore be worth it, for the child, perhaps for the whole of civilised society.\nHavkelaag: My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: And what if your experiment fails?\nHavkelaag: If the child remains evil after the experiment is concluded, it will be destroyed. Such is the fate of all used specimens.\nHavkelaag: Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg?

One of our most reliable contractors, though unfortunately this particular request was too much even for her.\nHavkelaag: I believe she quite lost her senses over the task. She came here insisting I purchase an owlbear egg from her, of all things.\nHavkelaag: I don't suppose you've stumbled across any githyanki eggs during your travels? The Society will compensate you for any we purchase, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nHavkelaag: Would you consider parting with it?

Don't you dare consider it.\nPlayer: What are you going to do with it?\nHavkelaag: Study it, of course. The githyanki have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months.\nHavkelaag: You are no doubt aware that citizens of the Underdark are held in great suspicion by those who live above ground. Many believe us to be 'evil'.\nHavkelaag: The githyanki face similar prejudice, but I believe, if hatched in a less violent, more intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome its evil predispositions.\nHavkelaag: I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: You're letting your personal biases affect your method. Why assume they're evil?\nHavkelaag: I assume nothing. Innate githyanki cruelty is an established fact - no doubt you witnessed it yourself in the retrieval of the egg itself.\nHavkelaag: When I have a suitable sample for my study, I will, however, prove that the effects of their biological inclination are reversible.\nHavkelaag: Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach:\nHavkelaag: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue.\nHavkelaag: Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: That kind of indoctrination and time-forced nurture violates the natural order. It invalidates the whole experiment.\nHavkelaag: I won't bother to argue with you. An arboreal shaman can't be expected to understand the rigorous protocols of theoretical research.\nHavkelaag: My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: Your findings are irrelevant, as are the opinions of all on this kaincha plane.\nHavkelaag: Ah. A display of the well-known githyanki arrogance. I am not sure my experiment can cure that particular affliction, but give me time and I will find a way.\nHavkelaag: Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg? ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: A gith hatchling is not a lab rat! This shka'keth should be bled dry for the mere suggestion.\nPlayer: Sell the egg.",

I am the druid Halsin.\nPlayer: Glad I could be of help.\nHalsin: I must admit, I didn't expect anyone would come to my aid. Who in their right mind would infiltrate a goblin infested temple.

He gives an alarmed look - he knows what’s inside you\nHalsin: Oak Father preserve you, child... You're infected, aren't you? The mind flayers' spawn.\nHalsin: But... something's different. You're aware of the monster inside you. You don't bow to the Absolute, like the True Souls do...\nHalsin: How is this possible...?\nPlayer: I think this artefact has something to do with it.\nHalsin: Hmmm... that looks very alien. As alien as the mind flayers. They do not belong on this world.\nHalsin: You weren't speaking lightly when you said you needed help. Let me tell you what I know.\nHalsin: I've been studying these parasites for a while now. Ever since I discovered these so-called True Souls are infected with them.\nHalsin: Someone is using very powerful magic to modify these tadpoles. They are using them to exert control over the infected.\nHalsin: I'm sorry to say, I can't undo that magic, which means I can't cure you. But that doesn't mean I can't help.\nHalsin: I didn't find what I came here for - a way to remove the tadpoles - but I found the next best thing. I found out where they come from.\nHalsin: That must be where these enchantments are placed on them, and it's where you'll find your cure.\nPlayer: You learned all this from your studies?\nHalsin: Indeed. After we dealt with the drow that ambushed us, Nettie and I were able to inspect the corpse - and the creature that slithered out of it.\nHalsin: I had no idea anyone beyond their ranks was infected. You have my sincere sympathies.\nPlayer: What should I do?\nHalsin: I overheard that the cultists are sending all of their captives to Moonrise Towers.\nHalsin: Innocents go in, True Souls come out. Given that all of these True Souls are infected, it has to be the source of this magic.\nHalsin: If you want to find a cure, you must head there and discover how the tadpoles are being manipulated.\nPlayer: At least I know what to do now. Thank you.\nHalsin: Wait - I could help you find a cure... but I need to settle matters here first.\nHalsin: I've no right to ask more of you... but if you could help me, I'd be free to join your journey to Moonrise.\nHalsin: I cannot allow these butchers to threaten my grove. The natural order must be protected.\nPlayer: Kagha was swayed by Shadow Druids. She nearly sealed the grove.\nHalsin: Kagha... I should have suspected she'd take things too far. I'll deal with her when I can.\nHalsin: But there are other matters to attend to before that.\nHalsin: Chaos is welcome, in doses; it helps keep balance. But this is too much - this is unnatural.\nHalsin: Help me kill the leaders of this horde, save my grove. Then I will help you.\n\nHalsin: Three deaths could win us peace: the drow Minthara, the hobgoblin Dror Ragzlin, and that perversion of a priestess, Gut.\nHalsin: They are the ones holding these parasites together. Remove them and nature will cure itself.\nPlayer: You ask too much of me. I can't help you.",

I live for pain and its intricacies, you see.\nAbdirak: But alas, they insist on being so primitive.\nAbdirak: Pain without purpose is a terrible thing, wouldn't you agree?\nPlayer: Who invited you? A goblin?\nAbdirak: Yes. He's just over there. Between you and I, his claims of mastery over pain are unfounded.\nNodeContext: Player has asked who invited him here. It was a goblin who is torturing someone next door. His tone is dismissive. He believes the goblin doesn't know what he's doing.\nAbdirak: Pain should be intimate and loving - not violent and brutish. Alas, he...\nAbdirak: Forgive me, but that look in your eyes - something terrible has happened to you.\nPlayer: I feel an endless nausea, that only goes away when I'm killing.\nAbdirak: Do not be ashamed, child. What I see in your eyes, in your soul, is only natural.\nAbdirak: We've all suffered in these dark times. It is little wonder you bear scars of pain and anguish.\nAbdirak: Please let me alleviate this pain.\nPlayer: And how would you do that?\nAbdirak: As the Maiden of Pain, the goddess Loviatar, teaches us...\nAbdirak: ...through penance - administered by my skilled hand.\nAbdirak: My work can grant peace and serenity - the likes of which few experience.

The druids blame us 'outsiders' for drawing them here. Nobody's welcome anymore.\nZevlor: They've started a ritual to cut the grove off from the world outside.\nZevlor: We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: What brought you here?\nZevlor: We're refugees from Elturel - we took shelter here after goblins and gnolls attacked us on the road.\nZevlor: We were bound for Baldur's Gate, and it was too late to turn back. Elturel had no place for tieflings after the Descent.\n: False\nPlayer: Is there a place for tieflings anywhere?\nZevlor: Hah - a fair point.

And you did too, by the looks of things.\nZevlor: We'll live to tell another tale, if we can just convince these druids not to turn us out on our backsides.\nZevlor: We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: This ritual - is there no way to convince the druids to stop it?\nZevlor: I've tried. Kagha - their new First Druid - won't see me.\nZevlor: You, though... I know it's not your business, but she owes you for saving this place.\nZevlor: Perhaps you could persuade her.

Her hands are in a prayer position and she's chanting softly as the moonlight dances around her. She exhales, then inhales and breaths in tendrils of shadow, absorbing them. She swallows, then begins hacking coughing. The moonlight dissipates. She quickly goes from seeming like a divine spirit to a normal young woman.\nIsobel: I didn't realise I had an audience.\nFist Marcus: Isobel. This is -\nIsobel: A Sharran.\nNarrator: *Isobel. The same name as Ketheric Thorm's daughter - the one whose sarcophagus you found empty in the family mausoleum.*\nPlayer: Push your Urges down.\nPlayer: I thought I smelled a Selûnite.\nIsobel: At your service.\nIsobel: Frankly, I'm surprised you're willing to help us. Your kind aren't known for their decency - particularly when a Sharran curse is our greatest obstacle.\nIsobel: But if you are who I think you are, I'd be a fool to reject your help. The True Soul with... well, a soul. Imagine.\nPlayer: I'm glad you've remembered who needs whose help here.\nIsobel: Oh - aren't you looking for a protection spell?\nPlayer: I need nothing from a Selûnite.\nIsobel: But any others who travel with you may not agree. Do it for them at least - you will need all the help you can get out there.\nPlayer: Try to understand what's happening.\nNarrator: *Is Lady Shar punishing you? Or perhaps testing you? Is it the tadpole, or a curse? You cannot say.*\nIsobel: Well! If the Moonmaiden didn't strike me dead for blessing you, she must rather approve of this little alliance.\nIsobel: This will block the lesser effects of the shadow curse, allowing you to traverse the darkness outside... should Shar's own protection falter, that is.\nIsobel: Curious. Surely the Nightsinger could have shielded all her followers, and made this place her domain long ago... yet she only acts now, and aids you alone. I wonder why.\nPlayer: The Dark Lady's works aren't for me to question.\nIsobel: Mustn't question the great shadow mother, must we?\nIsobel: I'll stop needling you, though. You have more important things to do, after all.\nPlayer: I do, though I already have a Moonlantern.\nPlayer: I already have a Moonlantern. I can safely travel the shadows.\nIsobel: Well! If I'd have realised, I'd have spared the theatrics. In that case, you should be able to navigate a path straight to your target. That's good - very good.\nIsobel: I wish you luck. The very best of it.\nPlayer: Hold on - Marcus is a True Soul. He's here to kidnap you.",

An archdruid knows all that is natural... and unnatural. I have studied this menace for some time, and wish to see it eradicated.\nHalsin: I'm certain a cure for you can be found at Moonrise Towers, but it's... complicated.\nHalsin: The journey, specifically - it's extremely perilous.

Easier at first, but you'll run into the shadow curse eventually.\nHalsin: You could also go under. There is a tunnel somewhere in the ruined temple of Selûne. It leads to Moonrise Towers through the Underdark.\nHalsin: Long ago, a man called Ketheric Thorm built a secret stronghold deep down there, before rallying a whole army of Dark Justiciars - Shar worshippers.\nShadowheart: Sounds rather ingenious.\nHalsin: Aradin and his lot were looking for a way down there - they were promised riches if they retrieved a relic called the Nightsong. But I think there's more.\nHalsin: From this stronghold, Ketheric's forces could access both the temple of Selûne and Moonrise Towers - but he was defeated before he could launch an attack.\nHalsin: If you can find this place, I'll wager it will reveal a more direct path to Moonrise Towers, and may even bypass the worst of the shadow curse.\nPlayer: I never thought I'd say this, but it sounds like the Underdark is the safer route.",

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon’s voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar.\nMalus Thorm: See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy.\nMalus Thorm: Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace.\nMalus Thorm: Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver.\nMalus Thorm: Come. Step forward. I can see the love of Shar darken your eyes. Be welcome.\nPlayer: What lesson are you teaching these sisters?\nMalus Thorm: The crux of our worship.\nMalus Thorm: Tell me, what is the guiding principle of the goddess?\nPlayer: Darkness.\nMalus Thorm: I profess there is another more profound.\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly.\nMalus Thorm: It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nKarlach: What the fuck is this loon talking about.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being?\nMalus Thorm: If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: You are well on your way. But one white orb disfigures you still. Let us finish the cure.\nMalus Thorm: We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: The sisters aren't ready. They'll make me sick instead of curing me.\n: True\nMalus Thorm: Their incisions are, as yet, still streaked with imprecision - that much I must concede.\nMalus Thorm: How to steady their hands, I wonder.\nPlayer: Sparring is vital to progress. Have them practice on each other.\nPlayer: Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\n: True\nMalus Thorm: Yes... For are we not all in need of a cure?\nMalus Thorm: The scalpel does not discriminate. Let each and every one of you partake in its soothing journey.\nMalus Thorm: Absence, sisters. Acquaint yourselves.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) Screaming and slashing, the sisters brutally murder each other.\nMalus Thorm: It is a proud moment when one sees one's teachings so lovingly taken to heart.\nMalus Thorm: You are to be commended for their graduation - rewarded with the promised cure.\nMalus Thorm: Come, I will acquaint you with the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nPlayer: You do me an honour, but I am not worthy. Show me the way of Shar - I beg of you.\nPlayer: I would rather acquaint myself - if you show me how.\n: True\nMalus Thorm: Your diligence is exemplary. Very well: your own scalpel you will be.",

It dragged Elturel straight to Hell.\nZevlor: Lucky for us, a group of adventurers found a way to bring the city back.\nZevlor: Afterwards, people looked at us and just saw 'devilkin'. No different from the druids here, really.\nZevlor: We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: Leave.",

Her hands are in a prayer position and she's chanting softly as the moonlight dances around her. She exhales, then inhales and breaths in tendrils of shadow, absorbing them. She swallows, then begins hacking coughing. The moonlight dissipates. She quickly goes from seeming like a divine spirit to a normal young woman.\nIsobel: I didn't realise I had an audience.\nFist Marcus: Isobel. This is -\nIsobel: A Sharran.\nNarrator: *Isobel. The same name as Ketheric Thorm's daughter - the one whose sarcophagus you found empty in the family mausoleum.*\nPlayer: Push your Urges down.\nPlayer: Let's not let an ancient squabble interfere with the task at hand.\nIsobel: Not as ancient as you think.\nIsobel: Frankly, I'm surprised you're willing to help us.

The True Soul with... well, a soul. Imagine.\nPlayer: You seem to have a lot to say about my allegiance. Can we focus on the task at hand?\nIsobel: I suppose that would be wise. We have a common enemy, after all: Ketheric Thorm.\nIsobel: You'll be needing the protection spell, I presume?\nIsobel: Oh - aren't you looking for a protection spell?\nPlayer: Nod. Better to humour her than make an enemy of all in this place. Lady Shar will understand.\nIsobel: Refreshingly pragmatic of you. I sense Shar has offered some amount of protection to you already, but... well, no harm in extra precaution - even from a Selûnite.\nPlayer: Try to understand what's happening.\nNarrator: *Is Lady Shar punishing you? Or perhaps testing you? Is it the tadpole, or a curse? You cannot say.*\nIsobel: Well! If the Moonmaiden didn't strike me dead for blessing you, she must rather approve of this little alliance.\nIsobel: This will block the lesser effects of the shadow curse, allowing you to traverse the darkness outside... should Shar's own protection falter, that is.\nIsobel: Curious. Surely the Nightsinger could have shielded all her followers, and made this place her domain long ago... yet she only acts now, and aids you alone. I wonder why.\nPlayer: The Dark Lady's works aren't for me to question.\nIsobel: Mustn't question the great shadow mother, must we?\nIsobel: I'll stop needling you, though. You have more important things to do, after all.\nPlayer: I do, though I already have a Moonlantern.\nPlayer: I already have a Moonlantern. I can safely travel the shadows.\nIsobel: Well! Now you have two. Just in case.\nIsobel: I wish you luck. The very best of it.\nPlayer: Wait - Marcus is a True Soul, you know. And not the good kind, like me.",

Nobody's welcome anymore.\nZevlor: They've started a ritual to cut the grove off from the world outside.\nZevlor: We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: What brought you here?\nZevlor: We're refugees from Elturel - we took shelter here after gnolls attacked us on the road.\nZevlor: We were bound for Baldur's Gate, and it was too late to turn back. Elturel had no place for tieflings after the Descent.\n: True\nNarrator: *'The Descent' - an infernal conspiracy that had seen the entire city of Elturel briefly dragged to the Hells.*\nPlayer: If your people survived that, they'll survive anything.\nZevlor: So I hoped. But we've lost so many already - and more will die if we're forced out again.\nZevlor: We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: What brought you here?\nZevlor: We're refugees from Elturel - we took shelter here after gnolls attacked us on the road.\nZevlor: We were bound for Baldur's Gate, and it was too late to turn back. Elturel had no place for tieflings after the Descent.\nNarrator: *You remember it. Elturel and all its citizens were dragged into Avernus - then back out again.*\nPlayer: I was there, you know. I'd hoped you'd had a happy ending.\nZevlor: We got out alive. That's what matters. And you did too, by the looks of things.\nZevlor: We'll live to tell another tale, if we can just convince these druids not to turn us out on our backsides.\nZevlor: We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: This ritual - is there no way to convince the druids to stop it?\nZevlor: I've tried. Kagha - their new First Druid - won't even see me.\nZevlor: You, though... I know it's not your business, but she owes you for saving this place.\nZevlor: Perhaps you could persuade her. For more time to prepare, if nothing else.\nPlayer: I have my own temporal concerns. I need a healer.\nPlayer: Enough about the ritual. I have my own problems.",

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon’s voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar.\nMalus Thorm: See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy.\nMalus Thorm: Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace.\nMalus Thorm: Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver.\nMalus Thorm: Come. Step forward. You are no sister, but that matters none. Every student is welcome.\nPlayer: A student, yes. Do please enlighten me.\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly.\nMalus Thorm: It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nShadowheart: A stinging truth - but a truth nonetheless.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being?\nMalus Thorm: If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: But you: look how the succour of Shar eludes even you, one who walks faithfully in her shadow. See how painfully present you remain...\nMalus Thorm: We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: Your subject is tainted. Shar's succour must only be granted to the willing.\nMalus Thorm: Hmmm. 'Only the willing may know the Lady's embrace.' You know her teachings well.\nMalus Thorm: And yet, these sisters must exercise their gifts, for the art of absence lies in its execution.\nMalus Thorm: How to proceed, I wonder.\nPlayer: Sparring is vital to progress. Have them practice on each other.\nPlayer: Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\n: True\nMalus Thorm: Yes... For are we not all in need of a cure?\nMalus Thorm: The scalpel does not discriminate. Let each and every one of you partake in its soothing journey.\nMalus Thorm: Absence, sisters. Acquaint yourselves.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) Screaming and slashing, the sisters brutally murder each other.\nMalus Thorm: It is a proud moment when one sees one's teachings so lovingly taken to heart.\nMalus Thorm: You are to be commended for their graduation - rewarded with the promised cure.\nMalus Thorm: Come, I will acquaint you with the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nPlayer: My magic has blinded me - I see now that Shar is the only path. Show me how - I beg of you.\nPlayer: I would rather acquaint myself - if you show me how.\n: True\nMalus Thorm: Your diligence is exemplary. Very well: your own scalpel you will be.",

Regretting it yet?\nWulbren Bongle: I spent a lot of time thinking of worst case scenarios while I was locked in that cell you plucked me out of at Moonrise.\nWulbren Bongle: I didn't imagine anything as bad as this. The Gondians have handed Enver Gortash the means to bring about the end of liberty in Baldur's Gate.\nWulbren Bongle: And the citizens have rolled out the red carpet for their new tyrant.\nWulbren Bongle: Resistance fighters are few and far between - my Ironhands, what's left of the Harpers, and you. I hope.\nPlayer: This is your fight - not mine.\nWulbren Bongle: You almost sound convinced by your own rothéshit.\nWulbren Bongle: Whatever brought you to the city, you won't get anywhere while the Gondians' metal monsters are patrolling the streets.\nWulbren Bongle: The Steel Watch. They're a threat to you, me - and every man, woman and child in the city.\nWulbren Bongle: They act all civilised... servants of the people. But they only serve one man.\nWulbren Bongle: When he becomes Grand Duke, it will only get worse. Laws will change, freedoms will vanish, and soon you'll be accused and sentenced before you've even committed a crime.\nWulbren Bongle: And the fucking Gondians are to blame for all of it.\nPlayer: Cheer up Wulbren. We're here to help.\nWulbren Bongle: I heard about that. You had the Harpers all excited, but there aren't many Harpers left.\nWulbren Bongle: These Steel Watchers. One of them is the equivalent of a red dragon. An army of them, well... there's never been an army of dragons.\nPlayer: How do we stop them?\nWulbren Bongle: By hitting the Gondians. Hard.\nWulbren Bongle: They invented the Steel Watchers. And they're building an army of them.\nWulbren Bongle: They've always been happy to provide their technology to despots in exchange for a stipend and the freedom to work in peace.\nWulbren Bongle: They would have licked Sarevok's boots given the chance, and now they'll kiss Gortash's ring while the city screams.\nWulbren Bongle: I had a plan to put a stop to them. But the way things are now, if we stick our heads above ground, the Watchers are on us like flies on shit.\nPlayer: I've already run foul of the Watchers myself.\nWulbren Bongle: And yet here you are, all in one piece. Most people who cross them aren't much more than a stain on the street afterwards.\nWulbren Bongle: You can do what's needed - I'm sure of it.\nWulbren Bongle: You just need a little assistance, and I can provide it.\nWulbren Bongle: The Gondians are ingenious. But we're more than equal to them - there's nothing they can build that the Ironhands can't tear down.\nWulbren Bongle: I've built something unique for just that purpose.\nWulbren Bongle: A runepowder bomb - first of its kind. Fifty wizards high on the Weave couldn't summon this kind of firepower.\nWulbren Bongle: Get the bomb inside the Gondian facility, and - boom. Problem solved.\nBarcus Wroot: Wulbren, please. This is too far! Everyone in the foundry would be killed.\nWulbren Bongle: Quiet, Barcus. The adults are talking.\nPlayer: Maybe the Gondians are victims, not oppressors.\nWulbren Bongle: The Gondians picked their side the minute they took orders from Gortash.\nWulbren Bongle: If they had any courage, they'd have refused him and died like heroes, spitting in his face.\nWulbren Bongle: Now they'll die like the dogs they are.\nPlayer: I'll make contact with the Gondians - maybe they'll see reason.\nBarcus Wroot: That's what I've been saying! There may yet be a peaceful solution.\nWulbren Bongle: Fine. You want to try flapping your gums in the belly of the beast, be my guest.\nWulbren Bongle: But their idea of diplomacy is a steel fist shoved where the sun don't shine.\nWulbren Bongle: So take the bomb. Just in case I'm right, and you're wrong.\nPlayer: Fine. I'll take it - but I'll only use it as a last resort.",

We can only hope the citizens of Baldur's Gate are more open-minded.\nZevlor: But we can't get there with those beasts blocking our path.\nZevlor: We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: This ritual - is there no way to convince the druids to stop it?\nZevlor: I've tried. Kagha - their new First Druid - won't see me.\nZevlor: You, though... I know it's not your business, but she owes you for saving this place.\nZevlor: Perhaps you could persuade her. For more time to prepare, if nothing else.\nPlayer: I'm sorry. I've got my own problems.",

Or perhaps testing you? Is it the tadpole, or a curse? You cannot say.*\nIsobel: Well! If the Moonmaiden didn't strike me dead for blessing you, she must rather approve of this little alliance.\nIsobel: This will block the lesser effects of the shadow curse, allowing you to traverse the darkness outside... should Shar's own protection falter, that is.\nIsobel: It won't be enough to protect you against areas of utter darkness, though - where the curse is strongest.

Where are you heading?\nRugan: We're bound for Baldur's Gate - got some cargo to deliver. But we've a stop to make along the way.\nPlayer: Maybe I should come - see you don't get waylaid again.\nRugan: Thanks. But that won't be necessary. We'll find help at Waukeen's Rest.\nRugan: Listen. You look like you know how to handle yourself.\nRugan: You should meet my associates. We've got our own drinking spot by the tavern - invitation only.\nRugan: Tell the fellow on the door 'little serpent, long shadow'. He'll take good care of you.\nOlly: Rugan!\nRugan: It's fine.

A little hospitality won't do any harm.\nPlayer: What's in the chest? Your cargo?\nRugan: Aye. The whole reason we're in this mess. Trinkets for some rich tosser in Baldur's Gate.\nRugan: He gets his shiny baubles, we get a handful of Tarenths.\nNarrator: *Tarenths are the currency of a merchant network called the Zhentarim. Led by the mysterious Pereghost of Darkhold, their dealings are far from scrupulous.*\nPlayer: You're Zhent - I'd wager more than just your crew have died over these 'baubles'.\nRugan: You know who we are - very clever. Then you probably also know it's not smart to interfere with Zhent business.\nRugan: This is the point when a clever operator like you accepts my gratitude and walks away.\nPlayer: You're missing a golden opportunity. Report the cargo lost - and we can sell it ourselves.\nPlayer: You'll find I'm very persuasive. We can make much more coin than you would with your employers.\n: True\nRugan: I like the way you think. Didn't expect to turn this horrorshow to my advantage... but why not?",

She swallows, then begins hacking coughing. The moonlight dissipates.

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon’s voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar.\nMalus Thorm: See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy.\nMalus Thorm: Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace.\nMalus Thorm: Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver.\nMalus Thorm: Come. Step forward. I can see the love of Shar darken your eyes. Be welcome.\nPlayer: May Shar guide your blessing hands.\nMalus Thorm: And the rough vessels that are yours.\nMalus Thorm: Tell me, what is the guiding principle of the goddess?\nPlayer: Forgetfulness.\nMalus Thorm: I profess there is another more profound.\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly.\nMalus Thorm: It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nWyll: Hells. Only a monster would inflict misery and call it medicine.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being?\nMalus Thorm: If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: But you: look how the succour of Shar eludes even you, one who walks faithfully in her shadow. See how painfully present you remain...\nMalus Thorm: We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: The sisters aren't ready. They'll make me sick instead of curing me.\n: True\nMalus Thorm: Their incisions are, as yet, still streaked with imprecision - that much I must concede.\nMalus Thorm: How to steady their hands, I wonder.\nPlayer: Sparring is vital to progress. Have them practice on each other.\nPlayer: Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\n: True\nMalus Thorm: Yes... For are we not all in need of a cure?\nMalus Thorm: The scalpel does not discriminate. Let each and every one of you partake in its soothing journey.\nMalus Thorm: Absence, sisters. Acquaint yourselves.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) Screaming and slashing, the sisters brutally murder each other.\nMalus Thorm: It is a proud moment when one sees one's teachings so lovingly taken to heart.\nMalus Thorm: You are to be commended for their graduation - rewarded with the promised cure.\nMalus Thorm: Come, I will acquaint you with the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nPlayer: You do me an honour, but I am not worthy.

She sought a githyanki egg.\nHavkelaag: Yes, dear Lady Esther. One of our most reliable contractors, though unfortunately this particular request was too much even for her.\nHavkelaag: I believe she quite lost her senses over the task. She came here insisting I purchase an owlbear egg from her, of all things.\nHavkelaag: I don't suppose you've stumbled across any githyanki eggs during your travels? The Society will compensate you for any we purchase, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nHavkelaag: Would you consider parting with it? The Society's coffers are deep enough to cover any expenses accrued in its retrieval, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: Chk. Don't you dare consider it.\nPlayer: What are you going to do with it?\nHavkelaag: Study it, of course. The githyanki have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months.\nHavkelaag: You are no doubt aware that citizens of the Underdark are held in great suspicion by those who live above ground. Many believe us to be 'evil'.\nHavkelaag: The githyanki face similar prejudice, but I believe, if hatched in a less violent, more intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome its evil predispositions.\nHavkelaag: I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: So the child inside will be experimented on?\nHavkelaag: Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach:\nHavkelaag: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue.\nHavkelaag: Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: You would teach the child virtue, but rear it without patience. Curious.\nHavkelaag: Tell me, then, philosopher - if patience delays the fostering of the other virtues, can it be rightly called virtuous?\nPlayer: Patience does not delay, it simply tempers virtue. Curtails it from excess.\nHavkelaag: A cautious, hesitant instinct. One I am afraid we do not have time for.\nHavkelaag: My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: Sounds pointless. Public opinion will hardly be swayed by such a small experiment.\nHavkelaag: Not at first. But if the experiment proves successful, it must be repeated. Only then will we know if the findings are to be trusted.\nHavkelaag: Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg? ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: A gith hatchling is not a lab rat! This shka'keth should be bled dry for the mere suggestion.\nPlayer: This experiment is barbaric. You're never getting the egg.",

Her hands are in a prayer position and she's chanting softly as the moonlight dances around her. She exhales, then inhales and breaths in tendrils of shadow, absorbing them. She swallows, then begins hacking coughing. The moonlight dissipates. She quickly goes from seeming like a divine spirit to a normal young woman.\nIsobel: I didn't realise I had an audience.\nFist Marcus: Isobel. This is -\nIsobel: A Sharran.\nNarrator: *Isobel. The same name as Ketheric Thorm's daughter - the one whose sarcophagus you found empty in the family mausoleum.*\nPlayer: Push your Urges down.\nPlayer: You can tell my allegiance from a look?\nIsobel: It's an aura. Or a lack of one, really.\nIsobel: Frankly, I'm surprised you're willing to help us. Your kind aren't known for their decency - particularly when a Sharran curse is our greatest obstacle.\nIsobel: But if you are who I think you are, I'd be a fool to reject your help. The True Soul with... well, a soul. Imagine.\nPlayer: I'm glad you've remembered who needs whose help here.\nIsobel: Oh - aren't you looking for a protection spell?\nPlayer: Nod. Better to humour her than make an enemy of all in this place. Lady Shar will understand.\nIsobel: Refreshingly pragmatic of you. I sense Shar has offered some amount of protection to you already, but... well, no harm in extra precaution - even from a Selûnite.\nPlayer: Try to understand what's happening.\nNarrator: *Is Lady Shar punishing you? Or perhaps testing you? Is it the tadpole, or a curse? You cannot say.*\nIsobel: Well! If the Moonmaiden didn't strike me dead for blessing you, she must rather approve of this little alliance.\nIsobel: This will block the lesser effects of the shadow curse, allowing you to traverse the darkness outside... should Shar's own protection falter, that is.\nIsobel: Curious. Surely the Nightsinger could have shielded all her followers, and made this place her domain long ago... yet she only acts now, and aids you alone. I wonder why.\nPlayer: I don't know what to make of it myself.\nIsobel: I suppose Shar is nothing if not mysterious.\nIsobel: I'll stop needling you, though. You have more important things to do, after all.\nPlayer: I've already been to Moonrise, but I have more work to do indeed.\nIsobel: I imagine so, if Jaheira hasn't gone tearing off into the night.\nPlayer: Wait - Marcus is a True Soul, you know. And not the good kind, like me.",

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon’s voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar.\nMalus Thorm: See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy.\nMalus Thorm: Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace.\nMalus Thorm: Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver.\nMalus Thorm: Come. Step forward. You are no sister, but that matters none. Every student is welcome.\nPlayer: You will stop this sick spectacle at once.\nMalus Thorm: Sick. Quite. But on the cusp of a cure:\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly.\nMalus Thorm: It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nAstarion: He's just like Cazador - utterly insane.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being?\nMalus Thorm: If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: But you: look how the succour of Shar eludes even you, one who walks faithfully in her shadow. See how painfully present you remain...\nMalus Thorm: We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: Your subject is tainted. Shar's succour must only be granted to the willing.\nMalus Thorm: Hmmm. 'Only the willing may know the Lady's embrace.' You know her teachings well.\nMalus Thorm: And yet, these sisters must exercise their gifts, for the art of absence lies in its execution.\nMalus Thorm: How to proceed, I wonder.\nPlayer: Sparring is vital to progress. Have them practice on each other.\nPlayer: Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\n: True\nMalus Thorm: Yes... For are we not all in need of a cure?\nMalus Thorm: The scalpel does not discriminate. Let each and every one of you partake in its soothing journey.\nMalus Thorm: Absence, sisters. Acquaint yourselves.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) Screaming and slashing, the sisters brutally murder each other.\nMalus Thorm: It is a proud moment when one sees one's teachings so lovingly taken to heart.\nMalus Thorm: You are to be commended for their graduation - rewarded with the promised cure.\nMalus Thorm: Come, I will acquaint you with the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nPlayer: I am not worthy! Please, show me how a master works - I would be honoured.\nPlayer: I would rather acquaint myself - if you show me how.\n: True\nMalus Thorm: Your diligence is exemplary.

I'm Zevlor.\nZevlor: And if I'm not mistaken, you're the Blade of Frontiers.\nPlayer: What is this place?\nZevlor: A druids' grove, dedicated to the Oak Father, Silvanus. You'll find its keepers just as thorny, I fear.\nZevlor: Whatever your business, I'd see to it quickly - the druids are forcing everyone out.\nZevlor: This attack will only strengthen their resolve.\nPlayer: Why are they forcing you out?\nZevlor: There have been several attacks by different monsters. The druids blame us 'outsiders' for drawing them here. Nobody's welcome anymore.\nZevlor: They've started a ritual to cut the grove off from the world outside.\nZevlor: We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: What brought you here?\nZevlor: We're refugees from Elturel - we took shelter here after gnolls attacked us on the road.\nZevlor: We were bound for Baldur's Gate, and it was too late to turn back. Elturel had no place for tieflings after the Descent.\nNarrator: *You remember it. Elturel and all its citizens were dragged into Avernus - then back out again.*\nPlayer: Found sanctuary here, did you?\nZevlor: So I hoped. But we've lost so many already - and more will die if we're forced out again.\nZevlor: We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: What brought you here?\nZevlor: We're refugees from Elturel - we took shelter here after gnolls attacked us on the road.\nZevlor: We were bound for Baldur's Gate, and it was too late to turn back. Elturel had no place for tieflings after the Descent.\n: True\nNarrator: *'The Descent' - an infernal conspiracy that had seen the entire city of Elturel briefly dragged to the Hells.*\nPlayer: Is there a place for tieflings anywhere?\nZevlor: Hah - a fair point. We can only hope the citizens of Baldur's Gate are more open-minded.\nZevlor: But we can't get there with those beasts blocking our path.\nZevlor: We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: This ritual - is there no way to convince the druids to stop it?\nZevlor: I've tried. Kagha - their new First Druid - won't even see me.\nZevlor: You, though... I know it's not your business, but she owes you for saving this place.\nZevlor: Perhaps you could persuade her. For more time to prepare, if nothing else.\nPlayer: I'm sorry. I've got my own problems.\nPlayer: Enough about the ritual. I have my own problems.",

Let me tell you what I know.\nHalsin: I've been studying these parasites for a while now. Ever since I discovered these so-called True Souls are infected with them.\nHalsin: Someone is using very powerful magic to modify these tadpoles. They are using them to exert control over the infected.\nHalsin: I'm sorry to say, I can't undo that magic, which means I can't cure you. But that doesn't mean I can't help.\nHalsin: I didn't find what I came here for - a way to remove the tadpoles - but I found the next best thing. I found out where they come from.\nHalsin: That must be where these enchantments are placed on them, and it's where you'll find your cure.\nPlayer: How did you come to study mind flayer parasites?\nHalsin: A drow forced me to defend myself. Afterwards, I was able to study the parasite that slithered out of the corpse, see what drives these 'True Souls'.\nHalsin: I had no idea anyone beyond their ranks was infected. You have my sincere sympathies.\nPlayer: This magic you mentioned - it isn't normal for these parasites?\nPlayer: Then everything we did here was hopeless.\nHalsin: Patience. I can't just snap my fingers... but I know where the solution almost certainly lies.\nHalsin: I overheard that the cultists are sending all of their captives to Moonrise Towers.\nHalsin: Innocents go in, True Souls come out. Given that all of these True Souls are infected, it has to be the source of this magic.\nHalsin: If you want to find a cure, you must head there and discover how the tadpoles are being manipulated.\nPlayer: You seem to know a lot about this. Will you come with me to Moonrise?\nHalsin: I wish I could, but there's still work I've yet to finish - blood I've yet to spill.\nHalsin: I've no right to ask more of you... but if you could help me, I'd be free to join your journey to Moonrise.\nHalsin: I cannot allow these butchers to threaten my grove. The natural order must be protected.\nPlayer: All right. How do I help?\nHalsin: My thanks. If you prevail, I'll owe you the debt of a lifetime.\nHalsin: It's too late to stop things from here - the goblins are already marching on the grove in force.\nHalsin: You must get ahead of them, muster the defences.\nPlayer: Very well.

I thought even the lowest of creatures had at least a shred of dignity. You prove me wrong.\nKith'rak Voss: But there's a repellent logic in your words. You may notice things a noble gith does not.\nKith'rak Voss: Very well, istik. Seek out survivors from the ship that crashed on this wretched world.\nKith'rak Voss: Bring me their heads. Bring me the weapon. If you succeed, the reward will be great.\nKith'rak Voss: Now go.",

It's not a secret to be shared lightly.\nShadowheart: The Dark Justiciars were the Nightsinger's most trusted warriors - this is where they earned their place.\nShadowheart: In order to join Lady Shar's elite, you had to pass her trials, then make a sacrifice in her innermost sanctum - one revealed only when you've proven yourself. Very few made it that far.\nShadowheart: I've dreamed of this place. This is my destiny - I must complete the trials.\nPlayer: All right, I'll help if I can.",

No, don't be ridiculous.\nShadowheart: I mean desperate people... like those refugees. Never gave them much thought. Certainly not that bunch in the grove.\nShadowheart: Yet we came through for them. We saved their lives. Odd.\nPlayer: Sounds like the wine is talking.\nShadowheart: It's not talking enough for my liking.\nNodeContext: 'Wish I had something stronger'. Holding up her glass and considering its contents in a playful critique.\nShadowheart: Share a bottle with me?\nPlayer: Just a bottle?\nShadowheart: It's quite a bottle.

Places her glass down to top it up, reaching for a nearby wine bottle.\nPlayer: Maybe those plans could change, for the right person...\nNarrator: *Shadowheart says nothing, but the glimmer of interest in her eyes is unmistakable.*\nPlayer: I'll find you later, once the camp's asleep.",

Give the artefact, and perhaps we will be merciful.\nShadowheart: No. I already faced Lady Shar. I passed her trials, I wielded her spear, and now I am her mortal voice. I have been embraced by her in ways you could only dream of.\nViconia DeVir: Nonsense. Ravings. You've strayed, girl - you've failed Lady Shar's mission and allowed ambition to rot your mind.\nShadowheart: Tell her. Tell them all. Tell them how the Nightsinger has blessed me.\nPlayer: Wait. Before we go any further, tell me what this is about. Why do you even want the artefact?\nViconia DeVir: I did not consent to questions. But I suppose you have undergone a great deal to reach this place, and anything I tell you cannot compromise me now - for you will either leave on my terms, or not at all...\nViconia DeVir: Whispers reached my ears from all corners - potential rivals of Lady Shar, all vying for the same prize. A new god, amassing the disaffected, the outcasts - those who should turn to us.\nViconia DeVir: This 'Absolute' is but an upstart; disturbing the natural order and threatening to impede the glorious return of Lady Shar's pure, endless darkness.\nViconia DeVir: I had to act. I had to strangle that foul conspiracy while it was still in the cradle.\nViconia DeVir: We learned all we could - the artefact was the one thing the Absolutists feared.

Give the artefact, and perhaps we will be merciful.\nShadowheart: No. I already faced Lady Shar. I passed her trials, I wielded her spear, and now I am her mortal voice. I have been embraced by her in ways you could only dream of.\nViconia DeVir: Nonsense. Ravings.

I had to strangle that foul conspiracy while it was still in the cradle.\nViconia DeVir: We learned all we could - the artefact was the one thing the Absolutists feared. The one thing they desperately wanted to keep out of their enemies' grasp. I had to have it.\nPlayer: You thought you could best the Absolute? The githyanki?\nViconia DeVir: To fight so many foes openly could prove unwise. Shar's children are better deployed as daggers in the shadows, not massed upon a battlefield.\nViconia DeVir: So let the others fight, while we wait. Once they are spent and bloodied from each other, we would slip in and take the prize. Alas, most of those I sent, perished. All but one.\nShadowheart: Lady Shar protected me. She guided me, elevated me. And now she wants me to cast you down.\nShadowheart: Tell them what you witnessed. Tell them how Lady Shar favours me.\nShadowheart: Tell her. Tell them all.
