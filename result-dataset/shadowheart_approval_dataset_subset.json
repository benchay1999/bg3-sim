It keeps pushing me - to you.\nNodeContext: On, \" to you\" SH's hand drifts toward a knife tucked into her belt at the small her back\nLae'zel: The ravings of a lunatic. Strike her down.\n: True\nNarrator: *There is a knife hidden in her belt. Her fingers twitch towards the hilt, ready to draw the blade.*\nPlayer: Keep your hands away from that blade.\nShadowheart: I keep thinking about the knife going deep. It's the only thing they want me to see.\nShadowheart: And I think they'll stop once I deal with you.\nPlayer: Don't do anything rash. There has to be an explanation for this.\nShadowheart: I don't want explanations. I want sleep.\nShadowheart: The whispering's already quieter here. Once you're dead, it'll be gone entirely.\nPlayer: You're exhausted - not thinking straight. You need to rest.\n: True\nShadowheart: Rest where? I can't leave. The whispers won't let me leave.\nPlayer: Attack her.",

What is it you're keeping from me?\n: True\nShadowheart: You're not going to let this go, are you? You might wish you had...\nShadowheart: I worship Shar, the Mistress of the Night. It is my holy mission to oppose Selûne, her teachings and her followers.\nShadowheart: Ngh... it hurts...\nShadowheart: Don't make a fuss, Selûnite - we may be at odds, but I have more important concerns than you right now.\nShadowheart: Now that you have the truth, please don't make a big fuss about it.\nPlayer: I'll decide whether to make a fuss or not. Hard to trust someone who's holding out on me.\nShadowheart: Secrecy is everything for Shar's children. It's our code, our creed, our shield.\nShadowheart: I even keep secrets from myself - I had my memories suppressed, so that nothing I knew could be used against the Dark Lady. Once I prove myself, my memories will be restored.\nShadowheart: I'm not sorry I kept this from you. Not one bit.\nShadowheart: Though perhaps that might change, if you can show an open mind.\nPlayer: Let's see how open-minded I can be then: tell me more.\nPlayer: Now that the truth's out, tell me more.\nShadowheart: All right. As I said, Shar is my patron, my mistress. Goddess of darkness and loss.\nShadowheart: I assume you've heard of her?\nPlayer: Remind me.\nShadowheart: My Lady Shar is the Nightsinger. The patron of darkness and loss.\nPlayer: Fascinating. Please, continue.\nShadowheart: Most fear the dark, like children, because in darkness they see their fears reflected.\nShadowheart: But Shar teaches us to step beyond fear. Beyond loss. In darkness we do not hide - we act.\nShadowheart: Pain. Hope. The promise of better days. All of these are heavy cloaks that bend our backs and burden our hearts.\nShadowheart: We shed those cloaks. Before Shar we stand gloriously naked, beyond the vanities of mortals.\nPlayer: How exactly do Shar worshippers turn people to their goddess?\nShadowheart: We tear down the lies the world is drunk on: the institutions they trust, the so-called gods they worship. The lives they cling to.\nShadowheart: We destroy false idols, topple corrupt organisations, fight heretics wherever they're found.\nShadowheart: There's often suffering - death even. Many people break before they embrace Shar's truths.\nPlayer: It sounds evil.",

Hard to trust someone who's holding out on me.\nShadowheart: Secrecy is everything for Shar's children. It's our code, our creed, our shield.\nShadowheart: I even keep secrets from myself - I had my memories suppressed, so that nothing I knew could be used against the Dark Lady.

The patron of darkness and loss.\nPlayer: Fascinating. Please, continue.\nShadowheart: Most fear the dark, like children, because in darkness they see their fears reflected.\nShadowheart: But Shar teaches us to step beyond fear. Beyond loss. In darkness we do not hide - we act.\nShadowheart: Pain. Hope. The promise of better days. All of these are heavy cloaks that bend our backs and burden our hearts.\nShadowheart: We shed those cloaks. Before Shar we stand gloriously naked, beyond the vanities of mortals.\nPlayer: When you put it like that, it seems strangely comforting.\nShadowheart: There's comfort, yes. But often there has to be pain beforehand...\nShadowheart: We tear down the lies the world is drunk on: the institutions they trust, the so-called gods they worship. The lives they cling to.\nShadowheart: We destroy false idols, topple corrupt organisations, fight heretics wherever they're found.\nShadowheart: There's often suffering - death even.

The archdevil Zariel's gladiator, come to burn the Sword Coast to ash.\nPlayer: You've got it all wrong, Wyll. Karlach's not about to hurt anyone.\nKarlach: Well - not counting the fuckers that need a good hurting.\nWyll: Shut it, devil - I know your kind. A heart darker than a shadow's nightmares.

I may be an effective soldier, but I never wanted to serve Zariel. Legged it away from her the first chance I got.\nWyll: And yet you served.\nPlayer: Stand down. You saw what I saw - Karlach is not a danger.\n: True\nNarrator: *Wyll catches his breath, and his lips straighten. Sheer dread twists his face.*\nWyll: No. Devils can not be trusted!\nPlayer: You saw Karlach's thoughts. She poses no threat to the Sword Coast.\nKarlach: You know monsters better than anyone. Can't you look in my eyes and see I'm not a devil?\nWyll: You don't know what this means. You don't know what you're asking me to do.\nKarlach: I'm asking you to live, Wyll. I don't want to hurt you. And, to be frank, I'd rather not find out how the Blade got his name.\nKarlach: I swear to you, on all I am, I'm not what you think.\nWyll: Shit. Shit.\nWyll: You really are no devil, are you?

I needed to ensure Vlaakith's trust. This was the only way.\nKith'rak Voss: I know you carry the Astral Prism, Lae'zel.\nKith'rak Voss: Within it lies the seed of Vlaakith's demise.

You are infected - yet the one in the Prism has chosen you, protects you with their power.\nKith'rak Voss: The Prism's tenant alone has the power to end Vlaakith's tyranny.\nKith'rak Voss: I've sought their freedom for aeons.

There is no purification, no ascension.\nKith'rak Voss: The zaith'isk does not purify - it extracts memory and kills the infected. Nor does the lich queen glorify the ascended. She feeds on most all of them to grow her power and pursue godhood.\nLae'zel: Madness. You flood me with this... this heresy.\nNodeContext: Not nearly as aggressive as usual.

Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy.\nMalus Thorm: Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace.\nMalus Thorm: Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver.\nMalus Thorm: Come. Step forward. You are no sister, but that matters none. Every student is welcome.\nPlayer: I don't wish to study, only to lift the curse on this land.\nMalus Thorm: A curse? Nay, a cure that leads to the very pinnacle of being:\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence.

Entertaining, if not efficient.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being?\nMalus Thorm: If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: You are well on your way. But one white orb disfigures you still. Let us finish the cure.\nMalus Thorm: We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: Your subject is tainted. Shar's succour must only be granted to the willing.\nMalus Thorm: Hmmm. 'Only the willing may know the Lady's embrace.'

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon’s voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar.\nMalus Thorm: See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy.\nMalus Thorm: Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace.\nMalus Thorm: Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver.\nMalus Thorm: Come. Step forward. You are no sister, but that matters none. Every student is welcome.\nPlayer: I don't wish to study, only to lift the curse on this land.\nMalus Thorm: A curse? Nay, a cure that leads to the very pinnacle of being:\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly.\nMalus Thorm: It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nLae'zel: Only a beast of a man toys with his victim. Entertaining, if not efficient.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being?\nMalus Thorm: If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: You are well on your way. But one white orb disfigures you still. Let us finish the cure.\nMalus Thorm: We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: Your subject is tainted. Shar's succour must only be granted to the willing.\nMalus Thorm: Hmmm. 'Only the willing may know the Lady's embrace.' You know her teachings well.\nMalus Thorm: And yet, these sisters must exercise their gifts, for the art of absence lies in its execution.\nMalus Thorm: How to proceed, I wonder.\nPlayer: Sparring is vital to progress. Have them practice on each other.\nPlayer: Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\n: True\nMalus Thorm: Yes... For are we not all in need of a cure?\nMalus Thorm: The scalpel does not discriminate. Let each and every one of you partake in its soothing journey.\nMalus Thorm: Absence, sisters. Acquaint yourselves.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) Screaming and slashing, the sisters brutally murder each other.\nMalus Thorm: It is a proud moment when one sees one's teachings so lovingly taken to heart.\nMalus Thorm: You are to be commended for their graduation - rewarded with the promised cure.\nMalus Thorm: Come, I will acquaint you with the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nPlayer: My magic has blinded me - I see now that Shar is the only path.

Hard to trust someone who's holding out on me.\nShadowheart: Secrecy is everything for Shar's children.

Not one bit.\nShadowheart: Though perhaps that might change, if you can show an open mind.\nPlayer: Let's see how open-minded I can be then: tell me more.\nPlayer: Now that the truth's out, tell me more.\nShadowheart: All right. As I said, Shar is my patron, my mistress. Goddess of darkness and loss.\nShadowheart: I assume you've heard of her?\nPlayer: Remind me.\nShadowheart: My Lady Shar is the Nightsinger. The patron of darkness and loss.\nPlayer: Fascinating. Please, continue.\nShadowheart: Most fear the dark, like children, because in darkness they see their fears reflected.\nShadowheart: But Shar teaches us to step beyond fear. Beyond loss. In darkness we do not hide - we act.\nShadowheart: Pain. Hope. The promise of better days. All of these are heavy cloaks that bend our backs and burden our hearts.\nShadowheart: We shed those cloaks. Before Shar we stand gloriously naked, beyond the vanities of mortals.\nPlayer: Sounds... daunting. I don't think it's for me.\nShadowheart: Give it time - and thought.\nShadowheart: We tear down the lies the world is drunk on: the institutions they trust, the so-called gods they worship. The lives they cling to.\nShadowheart: We destroy false idols, topple corrupt organisations, fight heretics wherever they're found.\nShadowheart: There's often suffering - death even.

But I certainly didn't share that with you.\nNightsong: There is nothing I can tell you that you do not already know yourself. They trained you well, trained you hard. Chiselled away any part of you that did not fit their plan. They made you forget.\nShadowheart: I chose to do that. For the mission. To protect Shar's -\nNightsong: - secrets. Yes, yes. That is an old song, girl. Your goddess cares more for her precious secrets than she does her devotees.\nShadowheart: Get to the point.\nNightsong: When you freed me, you severed a bond between me and that dog, Thorm. A bond of pain - his, inflicted on me.\nNightsong: When I laid eyes on you, I sensed a similar bond. You, tethered to two others, someplace distant. Let me help you remember.\nNarrator: *You feel Shadowheart's mind tug at the edges of your own. You know this sensation. She wants you to see whatever is about to be revealed.*\nPlayer: Open your mind to that sensation.\nNarrator: *Your mind joins with Shadowheart's. Something pulls at you both, bringing you elsewhere...*\n: True\nNarrator: *...It seems that one child never came back. She was taken.*\nShadowheart: What... who was that man?\nNightsong: You already know. Did you not see yourself in him? Do you not recognise your own blood?\nShadowheart: My father? That was him?\nNightsong: That is him. He lives still, and your mother too.\nShadowheart: No, it can't be. I'm an orphan.\nNightsong: And who told you that? Your adoptive family? You are not to blame. You were young, impressionable. They took you because they wanted to break and remake you.\nNightsong: But you are a child no longer. You are a woman. One who knows what must be done.\nShadowheart: My parents. I need to save them.\nPlayer: I'll help.\nNightsong: Your parents are with your abductors. You will need to return to their lair.
