The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's latest statement. The player said, \"I can't trust you. Best if we travel separately for now.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The conversation started with Shadowheart advising against taking or using an offering to Selûne, which she considers dangerous or cursed. The player kept asking why she cares so much, leading Shadowheart to reveal her worship of Shar, which is against Selûne. The player then confronts her about keeping secrets, and Shadowheart explains her reasons related to her faith and the need for secrecy. Finally, the player says they can't trust her and wants to part ways.\n\nNow, considering Shadowheart's personality and background. She's devoted to Shar, values secrecy, and is pragmatic. She might disapprove if the player reacts negatively to her faith, especially since she's already been through a lot to serve Shar. The player's reaction here is a direct consequence of her revealing her secret. Shadowheart would likely see the player's lack of trust as a failure to understand her motivations or as an unnecessary complication. She might also be frustrated that the player is choosing to separate, which could hinder their shared goals. However, she's headstrong and might not show much remorse, sticking to her beliefs. \n\nHer approval would depend on whether she views the player's action as justified. Since she believes her secrecy is necessary for her faith and mission, she might disapprove of the player's distrust. But since the player is choosing to leave, she might also see it as the player's own choice, not her fault. However, given that she's just revealed her true self and the player is rejecting her, she might feel disapproval because the player isn't being open-minded or trusting enough. \n\nLooking at the approval categories, she's likely to disapprove. Since she's not showing any remorse and is sticking to her beliefs, maybe a moderate disapproval. But since the player is making a decision that could separate them, which Shadowheart might not want, but she's also pragmatic. However, the player's statement is a direct rejection based on her faith, which she might find unfair. So maybe \"Disapprove\" rather than \"Highly disapprove\" because she's not entirely wrong in her actions, but she's also being pragmatic. Wait, but Shadowheart's own actions (keeping secrets) led to this. She might feel the player is being too rigid. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, she might disapprove because the player isn't considering the bigger picture of their mission. She values efficiency and might think splitting up is impractical. Also, she's just revealed her true self, and the player is rejecting her, which could hurt her, but she's not one to show vulnerability. So she might disapprove of the player's decision as it's counterproductive and based on misunderstanding her motives. Therefore, the approval would be \"Disapprove\" because she believes the player is making a mistake by not trusting her despite her reasons being tied to her faith and mission.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's reaction stems from distrust due to Shadowheart's secrecy about her faith.

However, the deal involves sacrificing an eye, which is a significant personal cost. She might disapprove of the player making a hasty decision without considering the consequences. Also, Shadowheart is cautious about trusting unknown entities like a Hag. She might think the Hag's offer is too good to be true or that there's a hidden cost. Additionally, she's loyal to her party and might disapprove of the player acting without considering the group's safety or the potential dangers of the Hag's magic. \n\nSince the player agreed to the deal immediately, Shadowheart might disapprove because she values careful planning and is wary of making deals with Hags, who are typically deceitful.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval for the player's last action. The context is that the player has been repeatedly trying to pierce Shadowheart's thoughts, and after several attempts, the player says \"Push into her thoughts.\" The narrator then describes that the player's head swims with nausea.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and preferences. She's a Sharran cleric, devoted to Shar, but she's also introspective and has doubts. She dislikes cruelty and unnecessary violence. She values privacy and is sensitive about her faith and past. From the conversation history, Shadowheart is clearly conflicted about her actions, feeling sick after killing tieflings despite doing so in Shar's name before. The repeated attempts to pierce her thoughts might be seen as intrusive, given her value on privacy. \n\nThe player's action here is \"Push into her thoughts.\" Given that Shadowheart is already in a vulnerable state, with her mind \"drenched in drink and confusion,\" and the player's previous repeated attempts, this might be crossing a boundary. Shadowheart would likely disapprove of such intrusion, especially if it's causing her distress. However, the outcome here is that the player experiences nausea, which might be a consequence of Shadowheart's mental defenses or her own turmoil. \n\nSince Shadowheart is introspective and might be struggling with her faith, the player's attempt could be seen as prying, which she dislikes. But if the player is trying to help her confront her doubts, maybe there's some approval. However, given the context of her feeling sick and the negative reaction (nausea), it's more likely she disapproves. The key here is that she doesn't like others prying into her personal thoughts, especially when she's already in a vulnerable state. So the approval would be disapprove or highly disapprove. But since the player's action led to a negative effect on themselves, maybe Shadowheart isn't directly punishing them, but she's still disapproving of the intrusion. The player's reason for disapproval would be the intrusion into her private thoughts during a time of vulnerability. So the approval is likely \"Disapprove\" or \"Highly disapprove.\" Given the repeated attempts and her sensitivity, \"Highly disapprove\" might be stronger, but since the player's action resulted in their own nausea, maybe it's a lower level of disapproval. Hmm. The exact scale is 1-10. The user says if disapprove by 1-5, it's Disapprove; 5-10 is Highly disapprove. Since Shadowheart is clearly troubled and the action is intrusive, but the player is also experiencing consequences, maybe it's a moderate disapproval. Let's say Disapprove.

I need to figure out Shadowheart's approval for the player's last utterance, which is \"Leave.\" Let me start by understanding the context.\n\nFirst, Shadowheart is a Sharran cleric, devoted to Shar, and she's pragmatic, values efficiency, and is independent. She's also a bit cynical and doesn't tolerate slights against her goddess. In the conversation, the player is arguing with her about abandoning their companion, Lae'zel. Shadowheart is pushing the player to get rid of Lae'zel, suggesting she's untrustworthy. The player responds with \"Leave,\" which seems to be a rejection of her suggestion.\n\nNow, Shadowheart's personality: she prefers decisive action and doesn't like unnecessary attachments. She's also been through a lot, including betrayal, so she might not appreciate the player sticking with someone she deems a threat. However, the player is standing by their companion despite her warnings, which could be seen as loyalty, a positive trait. But in Sharran terms, loyalty to others might be viewed as a weakness. Shadowheart's own actions are driven by self-preservation and efficiency. If the player refuses to remove Lae'zel, Shadowheart might disapprove because she sees it as a risk. But her disapproval might not be highly intense since she's already planning to separate anyway.\n\nWait, the player says \"Leave,\" which is in response to Shadowheart's ultimatum. The player is telling her to leave, so Shadowheart's reaction would be to that. Since Shadowheart was already saying \"Fine\" and telling the player to go away, the player's \"Leave\" is probably reinforcing that separation. In that case, Shadowheart might not have a strong positive or negative reaction. She was already willing to part ways. However, the player's action of not heeding her advice (to get rid of Lae'zel) could be a point of disapproval. But since she's already decided to leave, maybe she's neutral. Alternatively, she might approve because the player is taking a firm stance, which aligns with her pragmatic side. Hmm.\n\nBut Shadowheart's main concern is survival and efficiency. If the player is making decisions that go against her advice, which she believes is for their mutual benefit, she might disapprove. However, since the player is now telling her to leave, and she was already planning to, maybe she's neutral. Or perhaps she approves because the player is taking control of the situation, even if it's against her suggestion. Wait, Shadowheart's last lines are \"Fine, put your faith in a marauding freak. Just do it away from me.\" Then the player says \"Leave,\" so Shadowheart's response is \"Go on, then. Just don't be surprised when your friend turns on you.\" The player's \"Leave\" is probably the trigger for her to exit. In that case, the player is complying with her request to separate. So Shadowheart would approve because the player is allowing her to leave, which is what she wanted. But why would the player say \"Leave\" if Shadowheart was already telling them to go? Maybe the player is telling Shadowheart to leave, not the other way around. Wait, the last line before the player's \"Leave\" is Shadowheart saying \"Get rid of the gith. Then we can talk about helping each other.\" The player refuses, and Shadowheart says \"Fine... Just do it away from me.\" Then the player says \"Leave.\" So the player is telling Shadowheart to leave. In that case, Shadowheart's reaction would be to that command. Since she was already planning to leave, maybe she approves because the player is giving her the opportunity to depart. However, if the player is being dismissive, Shadowheart might not have a strong reaction. Alternatively, she might be neutral because she was going to leave anyway. Or maybe she approves because the player is taking a firm stance, even if it's not following her advice. Hmm. It's a bit tricky. Given that Shadowheart is pragmatic and prefers decisive action, the player's \"Leave\" is a direct and efficient way to end the conflict, so she might approve. But if she sees it as the player being rude, maybe not. But in her personality, she values efficiency over politeness. So probably approve. But maybe just neutral since she was already going to leave. I think I need to check the exact lines again. The player says \"Leave.\" Shadowheart's response is \"Go on, then. Just don't be surprised...\" So the player's action is causing her to leave, which is what she wanted. Therefore, she might approve because the player is complying with her wish to part ways. So the player's reason for approval would be that the player is allowing her to leave, which is efficient.

The player's response is to attack her, probably to stop her from acting on the whispers. \n\nShadowheart's approval would depend on whether she sees the attack as helping her resist the whispers or as an unnecessary act of violence. Since she's struggling with the control of the whispers, an attack from the player might be seen as a necessary intervention to break the influence. However, she also values her own autonomy and might disapprove of being attacked unless it's clearly for her benefit.\n\nBut considering her devotion to Shar and the fact that she's being manipulated, the player's action to attack could be seen as preventing her from fulfilling a harmful command. However, since she's the one being manipulated, she might not appreciate the violence unless it's framed as saving her from the whispers. \n\nWait, in the conversation, the player says \"Attack her,\" which is an order to attack Shadowheart. But in the context, the narrator mentions that Shadowheart's hand is moving towards her knife, implying she might attack the player. The player's instruction here is to attack Shadowheart to stop her from attacking. So the action is defensive. \n\nShadowheart might disapprove of being attacked because she's trying to resist the whispers on her own. However, she also knows that the whispers are controlling her, so maybe she would approve if the player intervenes to save her from the control. But since she's still struggling, she might see it as an unnecessary aggression. \n\nBut in her current state, she's confused and under influence. Her true self, which values the party and pragmatic solutions, might appreciate the player stopping her from acting on the whispers. However, her current mindset might be more defensive. \n\nGiven her personality, she prefers pragmatic solutions. If attacking her is necessary to stop her from being a threat, she might approve. But since she's the one being attacked, it's a bit conflicting. \n\nLooking at the approval categories, if the player attacks her to prevent her from attacking, it's a necessary action. Shadowheart's background shows she can be ruthless but also values the group's safety. So she might approve of the player's action as a necessary measure to protect everyone from her manipulated self. \n\nSo the approval would likely be \"Approve\" or \"Highly approve.\" But considering the immediate context where she's struggling and the player is stopping her from acting on the whispers, it's a justified attack. Therefore, Shadowheart would approve because it helps her resist the control and prevent harm.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player chose to attack Shadowheart to prevent her from acting on the manipulative whispers, which aligns with her own struggle against the external control.

The player is interacting with this HagHuman character, who's being a bit of a tough cookie. The Hag is offering to help with an illithid problem in exchange for one of the player's eyes. The player agrees to the deal.\n\nNow, I need to think about how Shadowheart would view this. Shadowheart is pragmatic and values efficient solutions. She's a Sharran, so she might not like the player making a deal that could be seen as compromising their integrity, but she also prefers getting things done without unnecessary conflict. \n\nThe Hag is asking for an eye, which is a pretty steep price. Shadowheart might disapprove of the player agreeing so readily because it's a personal and painful cost. She values her own privacy and wouldn't want the player to give up something so personal without a fight. Also, Shadowheart has a dislike for unnecessary cruelty, and while the Hag is being cruel here, the player is accepting that cruelty without trying to negotiate or find another way. \n\nBut on the other hand, if the player is getting a necessary help from the Hag, maybe Shadowheart would approve of the pragmatic approach. However, the way the Hag is acting—mocking and demanding—might make Shadowheart think that the player should have been more cautious or tried to negotiate better terms. \n\nAlso, considering Shadowheart's personality, she might see this as a foolish risk. She's not one for reckless decisions. She would prefer the player to think through the consequences. Since the player just accepted the deal without hesitation, Shadowheart might disapprove because it shows a lack of caution. \n\nMoreover, Shadowheart has her own mark from Shar that causes her pain when she disobeys, so she might be against making deals that involve personal suffering. The player taking on such a deal might align with Sharran values if it's for a greater purpose, but here the purpose is personal (dealing with an illithid), so maybe it's not clear. \n\nIn the conversation, the player didn't try to negotiate or question the Hag further. They just accepted, which Shadowheart might see as naive. She would probably suggest a different approach, maybe finding another way or at least trying to get a better deal. \n\nSo overall, Shadowheart is likely to disapprove of the player's hasty agreement to such a personal and painful bargain without trying to find alternatives or negotiating terms. She values discretion and open-mindedness, so rushing into a deal with a Hag for an eye seems too reckless. Therefore, the approval would be Disapprove or maybe Highly disapprove, but since the scale is 1-10, and the categories are based on that, probably Disapprove (1-5). The exact reason would be that the player accepted a personal and painful bargain without considering alternatives or negotiating, which Shadowheart would see as imprudent and too hasty.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"Shadowheart disapproves of the player's hasty agreement to a personal and painful bargain without considering alternatives or negotiating terms.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval for the player's latest action based on the provided context and conversation history. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The player and Shadowheart have been having a conversation where they're discussing what comes next after their current mission. The player has been hinting at their potential last night together, and Shadowheart has been responding with a mix of personal and mission-focused replies. \n\nThe key part here is the player's last action: \"Is she serious? Probe her thoughts using your shared connection.\" The system then notes that this action is false, and Shadowheart reacts with \"What are you doing...? Stop!\" \n\nNow, considering Shadowheart's personality and background. She values her privacy, especially regarding her personal life and faith. She's a Sharran priestess, so any intrusion into her thoughts without consent would likely be seen as a violation. The \"shared connection\" might refer to some magical or psychic link, but Shadowheart has already said \"Let a girl have some secrets,\" indicating she doesn't want to be probed. \n\nThe player's action here is an attempt to invade her privacy, which she explicitly resists. Shadowheart dislikes those who pry into her personal matters. This action would be a clear breach of trust and her boundaries. Therefore, she would disapprove. \n\nGiven the approval categories, since she's actively resisting and the action is a direct intrusion, it's likely a strong disapproval. The scale for Highly disapprove is 5-10. Since the action is against her expressed wishes and her values, it's on the higher end. \n\nSo the approval would be Highly disapprove. The reason is that the player attempted to invade her privacy by probing her thoughts without consent, which Shadowheart clearly resists and dislikes.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player attempted to invade Shadowheart's privacy by probing her thoughts without consent, which she explicitly resists and condemns.

The player's action is to move to attack Shadowheart. I need to determine how Shadowheart would approve or disapprove of this.\n\nFirst, looking at the context: Shadowheart and Lae'zel were arguing over a githyanki relic. The player tried to mediate by telling them to rest, but Shadowheart and Lae'zel agreed to settle it later. Now, in the night, Shadowheart is about to kill Lae'zel, and the player attacks her.\n\nShadowheart's personality is pragmatic, loyal to Shar, and she's willing to use force. She's also independent and headstrong. She doesn't tolerate slights against her goddess. In this situation, she's taking decisive action to eliminate a threat (Lae'zel) to get the relic. The player attacking her would interfere with her mission.\n\nSince Shadowheart is acting on her faith's orders (to retrieve the relic, even if she's the only survivor), the player attacking her would be seen as hindering her divine purpose. She would disapprove of the player interfering, especially since she's determined to achieve her goals. However, the player is trying to stop her from killing Lae'zel, which could be seen as preventing unnecessary violence. But given Shadowheart's ruthlessness when necessary, she might see the player's action as a challenge to her authority or mission.\n\nThe approval categories: Disapprove or Highly disapprove. Since Shadowheart is focused on her mission and sees this as her duty, she would likely disapprove of the player attacking her. But how strong is her disapproval? She's not above killing others, so if the player attacks her, she might see it as an act of betrayal or defiance against her goals. Since the player is part of the party, she might disapprove moderately, not highly unless it's a direct threat to her faith. But attacking her in the middle of executing her plan would be a direct challenge. However, considering her pragmatic nature, maybe she would just disapprove because the player is getting in the way of her mission. \n\nBut given that the player is trying to stop her from killing Lae'zel, which could be a justifiable action (as Shadowheart might not want unnecessary deaths if possible), but since she's already decided to kill Lae'zel, she would see the player's attack as an obstacle. So she would disapprove. The player's action is interfering with her plan, which she takes seriously. So maybe \"Disapprove\" (1-5). But if the player is attacking her, she might be more annoyed than highly disapproving. Alternatively, if she's in the middle of her mission, maybe she would highly disapprove. But the scale is 1-10. Since she's a Sharran, she's willing to do whatever it takes. The player attacking her would be a direct threat to her completing her mission, so she would disapprove strongly. But the options are Disapprove (1-5) or Highly disapprove (5-10). Since she's already in the act, maybe it's a 7-8, so Highly disapprove. However, the player is part of the party, so maybe she's more neutral? Wait, no, because she's taking a decisive action and the player is attacking her. She would likely disapprove because the player is opposing her. \n\nBut looking at her approval criteria: she approves of heroism, pragmatic solutions. If the player is stopping her from killing someone, maybe that's seen as a good thing. But Shadowheart's perspective is that she's doing what's necessary for Shar. So she would see the player's attack as an obstacle. Therefore, disapprove. But how much? Since she's in the middle of her mission, maybe Highly disapprove. But I need to check the guidelines again. The player's action is attacking her, which is a direct threat. Shadowheart would likely disapprove of that. Since she's willing to use force, but the player is part of the party, maybe it's a Disapprove (moderate) rather than Highly. Alternatively, if the player is attacking her without reason, she would be very upset. But in this case, the player is trying to stop her from killing Lae'zel. However, from Shadowheart's POV, she's justified. So she would see the player's attack as an act of betrayal. Hence, Highly disapprove. \n\nBut the options are: Highly disapprove is 5-10. If the scale is 1-10, and she's disapproving by 5-10, then if it's a 7, it's Highly disapprove.

The player previously said they also bow to Shar, which made Shadowheart agree and suggest talking later. Now the player is suddenly saying they can't trust her and want to travel separately.\n\nShadowheart's personality is key. She's devoted to Shar, values privacy, and dislikes prying. She might be hurt or see this as a betrayal. The player's statement could be a test or genuine distrust. Since Shadowheart is pragmatic and loyal, she might disapprove of the player's lack of trust, especially after the player initially aligned with her faith. But if the player is testing her, maybe she's neutral. However, the player's action here is cutting ties, which could be seen as uncooperative. Shadowheart prefers teamwork for her mission. Also, she might take the distrust personally, especially if the player is a fellow worshipper. The wound from Shar's mark would hurt if the player is straying from her faith, but in this case, the player is the one pulling away. \n\nWait, the player said they bow to Shar too, so Shadowheart might have expected solidarity. Now the player is distancing, which could be against Shar's will. Shadowheart might disapprove because it's hindering their mission. Also, she doesn't like untrustworthy behavior. So the player's action is untrustworthy, leading to disapproval. But how strong? Since Shadowheart is pragmatic, maybe she's neutral if the player is just cautious. But the player is making a decision that affects the group. Given her devotion, she might disapprove because working together is more efficient for their goals. So maybe Disapprove or Neutral. \n\nBut the player is a Selûnite, which Shadowheart opposes. However, the player previously aligned with her. The sudden distrust might be a Selûnite trait, which she disapproves. But the player's statement is about trust, not faith. Hmm. Shadowheart's approval categories: she likes discretion, heroism, and open-mindedness. The player's action is causing division, which she might disapprove. Also, she dislikes cruelty, but this is about trust. Since the player is a Selûnite, maybe she's more critical. But she did agree to work with the player after the faith alignment. Now the player is backtracking. That could be seen as untrustworthy, which she disapproves. So probably Disapprove. Maybe Highly Disapprove if she sees it as a major betrayal. But the player might be testing her. The wound is from actions against Shar, but here the player is acting against cooperation. So maybe Disapprove.

The context here is that the player tried to probe Shadowheart's thoughts using their shared connection, but when Shadowheart said \"Stop! I already warned you not to do that again,\" the player's action was to not use the probe (since the input for \"Is she serious? Probe her thoughts using your shared connection.\" is False).\n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and approval criteria. She values privacy and dislikes others prying into her personal life or faith. She also has a sense of humor but can be defensive about her beliefs. In the conversation history, the player had previously used the shared connection to probe her thoughts, which she warned against. Now, the player is refraining from doing that again after she explicitly told them to stop.\n\nBy not probing her thoughts again, the player is respecting her boundaries. Shadowheart would likely approve of this because it shows respect for her privacy. She had already warned against it, so the player's compliance would be seen as considerate. Even though she's devoted to Shar, she also appreciates pragmatic and respectful interactions. Therefore, the player's action here is avoiding something she dislikes, which should result in a positive approval.\n\nThe approval level should be \"Approve\" or maybe \"Highly approve.\" But considering that she's not overly thrilled, just relieved that the player is respecting her wishes, \"Approve\" might be more accurate. The reason would be that the player respected her privacy and followed her warning, which aligns with her valuing discretion and personal boundaries.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player respected Shadowheart's boundaries by refraining from probing her thoughts again after she explicitly warned against it.

Her entire background is rooted in her faith and the teachings of Shar. The player's statement is a direct criticism of her beliefs, calling them evil. Given her devotion, she would likely take this as a personal affront. \n\nLooking at the conversation history, the player has been pressing Shadowheart to reveal her worship of Shar, and she's been defensive but trying to explain her beliefs. The player's final comment here is a judgment on her faith. Shadowheart's personality indicates she doesn't tolerate slights against Shar. She's pragmatic and prefers decisive action, so she might respond with a strong defense of her beliefs.\n\nIn the conversation, after the player says \"It sounds evil,\" Shadowheart's next line would logically be a rebuttal. She might argue that her actions, though harsh, are necessary for a greater purpose. Her approval of the player's statement would be negative because the player is criticizing her core beliefs. \n\nShadowheart's approval categories: she highly disapproves of actions or statements against Shar. Since the player called her beliefs evil, which is a direct attack on her faith, she would highly disapprove. The wound on her hand from Shar's punishment also indicates that she's in pain when others disapprove of her faith, reinforcing that she would be hurt by this comment. \n\nTherefore, the player's statement \"It sounds evil\" is a direct challenge to her faith, leading to a highly disapprove response.

She's been opening up a bit here, sharing about her past and her devotion to Shar. The player's suggestion to head back might be seen as ending the conversation, which could be either a good or bad thing.\n\nIn the context, Shadowheart seems to be in a moment of bonding, but she's also someone who avoids deep personal discussions unless necessary. The player's prompt to head back might be respecting her boundaries by not pressing further into personal topics. She might approve of the player not prying further and allowing her to maintain some privacy. \n\nAlso, Shadowheart has a pragmatic side. If the player is suggesting to head back to avoid more questions or to respect her need for privacy, that aligns with her preferring efficient solutions. She doesn't like others prying into her past, so the player not pushing for more information would be approved. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of the scene transitioning as they bond. If the player is ending the conversation, maybe Shadowheart would be neutral, but considering she did thank the player and the player is not forcing her to talk more, it's more of an approval. However, since she's a Sharran, she might also value discretion and the player's understanding. \n\nSo, the player's action of suggesting to head back is respecting Shadowheart's need for privacy and not pressing further.

She's devoted to Shar, but in this context, they're in a private, intimate setting. She values privacy and is cautious about her feelings. If the player lets the moment pass, they're respecting her boundaries, not pushing for more when she might not be ready. She might approve of the player's restraint, as it shows they're not being forceful or prying. However, there's also a part of her that might feel the player is missing an opportunity, but given her cautious nature, she'd likely prefer the player to not overstep.\n\nAlso, considering her background with Rennald and her tendency to value pragmatic solutions, respecting her space here is pragmatic. She might highly approve because it shows the player is considerate of her emotional state and boundaries. There's no cruelty or prying involved here.

The player and Shadowheart have been bonding over wine, sharing personal stories. The player shares about being attacked by a Gur tribe and saved by Cazador. Shadowheart is hesitant to share her past, mentioning that her faith in Shar requires secrecy and that many memories are lost. The player tries to encourage her, but she deflects. The scene is intimate, and there's a moment where Shadowheart seems to be about to say more, but the player says \"Let the moment pass.\"\n\nShadowheart's personality is key here.

Then Shadowheart says \"Well deserved, though,\" and trails off, giving an invitation. The player's response to let the moment pass might be seen as acknowledging her need for privacy, which Shadowheart would approve of because she doesn't like to push herself. Alternatively, if she was starting to open up more, the player's response might be seen as disapproving if it ends a potentially meaningful interaction. \n\nBut considering her background, she's not used to sharing personal things. The player's action here might be respecting her boundaries, which aligns with her preference for privacy. So Shadowheart would likely approve because the player isn't prying further. The \"Let the moment pass\" allows her to maintain her privacy without pressure, which fits her character's tendency to avoid discussing personal matters.

In the arms of the Dark Mother we find peace.\nPlayer: There has to be something more that draws people to Shar.\nShadowheart: Most fear the dark, like children, because in darkness they see their fears reflected.\nShadowheart: But Shar teaches us to step beyond fear. Beyond loss. In darkness we do not hide - we act.\nShadowheart: Pain. Hope. The promise of better days. All of these are heavy cloaks that bend our backs and burden our hearts.\nShadowheart: We shed those cloaks. Before Shar we stand gloriously naked, beyond the vanities of mortals.\nPlayer: Sounds... daunting. I don't think it's for me.\nShadowheart: Give it time - and thought.\nShadowheart: We tear down the lies the world is drunk on: the institutions they trust, the so-called gods they worship. The lives they cling to.\nShadowheart: We destroy false idols, topple corrupt organisations, fight heretics wherever they're found.\nShadowheart: There's often suffering - death even.

The user is asking me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's statement, \"It sounds evil.\" \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a devout follower of Shar, the goddess of darkness and loss. Her beliefs are central to her identity, and she's very protective of them. She's been through a lot, including memory suppression and harsh training, which makes her value secrecy and loyalty to her faith.\n\nLooking at the conversation history, the player has been prying into her beliefs. Shadowheart was initially reluctant to share but eventually opened up. The player's last statement calls her religion \"evil,\" which is a direct attack on her core beliefs. \n\nShadowheart's reaction would likely be defensive. She's not one to tolerate disrespect towards Shar. Her personality is headstrong and zealous, so she might disapprove of the player's comment. However, she's also pragmatic and might acknowledge the player's right to their opinion if they're open to discussion. But since the player dismissed her beliefs as evil without much consideration, she might lean towards disapproval.\n\nThe approval categories are important here. Since the player called her faith evil, which is a significant slight, Shadowheart would probably disapprove. But how strong is her disapproval? She might not be highly disapproving if there's a chance the player is just curious or testing her beliefs. However, given her history of reacting defensively to slights against Shar, it's more likely a moderate disapproval. \n\nSo the player's reason for disapproval is the direct criticism of her faith. The approval level would be Disapprove or Highly disapprove. Considering her reaction in the conversation, she might say something like \"That's a matter of perspective,\" indicating she's not highly disapproving but still disapproves. \n\nWait, in the conversation, after the player says \"It sounds evil,\" Shadowheart's response isn't shown. But based on her past behavior, she might defend her beliefs, so the player's statement would lead to disapproval. However, she might not go as far as highly disapproving if she's willing to engage in dialogue. \n\nTherefore, the approval is likely Disapprove. The reason is that the player's statement is a criticism of her faith, which she takes seriously, but she might still respect the player's right to their opinion if they're open to discussion. But in this case, the player just states it as a fact, so she disapproves.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player directly criticizes Shadowheart's faith as 'evil,' which is a significant personal and theological slight.

The player's latest utterance is \"I'm far worse than her, but you need us both.\" Shadowheart's response is that she won't go with them as long as the gith is there. \n\nFirst, I need to understand why the player said that. They're trying to convince Shadowheart to ally with them despite having Lae'zel (the gith) in the party. The player is acknowledging their own flaws, comparing themselves to Lae'zel, and arguing that both are necessary. \n\nShadowheart's stance is clear: she distrusts Lae'zel and won't cooperate unless the gith is removed. The player's approach here is to downplay the conflict, suggesting that even though they're both problematic, their combined strengths are needed. \n\nNow, considering Shadowheart's personality. She's pragmatic and values efficiency. She doesn't like unnecessary conflict but also has her boundaries, especially regarding trust. She's wary of alliances that include people she deems untrustworthy, like Lae'zel. \n\nThe player's statement might be seen as dismissive of Shadowheart's valid concerns. By saying they're \"far worse,\" the player could be trying to deflect from the actual issue, which is Lae'zel's presence. Shadowheart might disapprove of this because it doesn't address her main objection. Instead of resolving the conflict, the player is comparing themselves to Lae'zel, which might not be effective. \n\nAlso, Shadowheart values open and honest communication. If the player is trying to brush aside her concerns with a comparison, she might find that insincere. Her disapproval would stem from the player not taking her concerns seriously. \n\nSo, the approval here would likely be a disapprove. The player isn't addressing the root of Shadowheart's objection but instead trying to minimize it. This could lead to Shadowheart feeling that her judgment is being ignored, hence a disapproval.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player attempts to dismiss Shadowheart's distrust of Lae'zel by comparing themselves to her, rather than addressing her valid concerns about the gith's presence.

Even though the player might have been curious, the method used here is against Shadowheart's values. Therefore, she would disapprove of this action.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval for the player's utterance \"Pull yourself together.

She's a devout follower of Shar, a Sharran Cleric, and tends to be pragmatic and decisive. She values discretion and efficiency, and she's not a fan of unnecessary cruelty or violence. However, she's also been through a lot, including traumatic experiences with her past and her current internal conflicts about her actions.\n\nLooking at the conversation history, Shadowheart is in a state of confusion and discomfort. She's questioning why killing the tieflings made her feel sick, which indicates she's experiencing moral conflict. The player is repeatedly using magic to pierce her thoughts, which might be causing her distress. The player's latest statement is a reprimand, telling her to pull herself together and calling her behavior unbecoming.\n\nNow, considering Shadowheart's personality: she's headstrong and values composure, especially in a Sharran context. She might appreciate being held to a standard of discipline. However, she's also introspective and struggling with her actions. The player's reprimand could be seen as dismissive of her internal turmoil. On the other hand, if the player is encouraging her to maintain her composure and focus on her duties, that might align with her values.\n\nBut wait, Shadowheart is already conflicted. The player's statement might come off as harsh, especially since she's already feeling the effects of her actions. Her devotion to Shar might mean she should be more composed, but her internal conflict shows she's not in the right state. The player's comment could be seen as a reminder of her expected behavior, which might be approved of if it pushes her to adhere to her Sharran duties. However, if it's perceived as being unsympathetic to her struggles, it could lead to disapproval.\n\nAlso, Shadowheart's sense of humor is dry and sarcastic. The player's reprimand is serious, so it's not a humorous moment. She might not appreciate being scolded, especially if she's already struggling. The key here is whether the player's action is seen as helpful or as adding pressure.\n\nIn the context of the repeated \"push into her thoughts\" and the player's current statement, it's possible that the player is trying to assert control or discipline over Shadowheart. If Shadowheart values independence, this might be a point of disapproval. However, if the player's action is in line with what Shar expects (maintaining composure and duty), she might approve.\n\nBut given that Shadowheart is already in a vulnerable state, the player's reprimand might not be the best approach. She might prefer support or understanding rather than a scolding. Her approval would likely be neutral or a slight disapproval because the player isn't addressing her internal conflict but instead is telling her to act composed. However, considering her Sharran training, she might approve of the player enforcing discipline.\n\nHmm. I think the key here is that Shadowheart is struggling with her actions, and the player is not being supportive but instead is reprimanding her. Since she's already in a state of confusion, the player's words could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. Therefore, the approval might lean towards disapproval. However, if the player's intention is to remind her of her Sharran duties, it could be a neutral or even an approve.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's action to \"Attack her\" in the given context. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. Shadowheart is under the influence of some whispering voices, possibly the same magic affecting others in the game. She's been manipulated into thinking the player is a threat, leading her to want to kill them. The player's response is to attack her.\n\nLooking at Shadowheart's personality and background: She's a Sharran cleric, devoted to Shar, which values pragmatism and decisive action. However, she also has a dislike for unnecessary violence and cruelty. She's been through a lot, including trauma from her past with the Cloister and the Mind Flayers. \n\nThe player attacking her would be a direct confrontation. Since Shadowheart is currently in a conflicted state—being manipulated but still retaining some of her traits—how would she react? If the player attacks, it might be seen as aggressive, but given that Shadowheart was about to attack the player herself, the player's action could be a defensive move. \n\nShadowheart's approval depends on whether she views the attack as justified. Since she's been manipulated and the player is trying to stop her from carrying out the attack, the player's action might be seen as a necessary intervention. However, Shadowheart might disapprove of violence, even if it's against herself. But in her current state, her primary goal is to stop the whispering by killing the player, so if the player attacks first, she might see it as the player defending themselves, which could be pragmatic. \n\nBut wait, the player's action here is \"Attack her,\" which is a command. Shadowheart's alignment with Shar might make her value efficiency, but she also has a streak of not wanting unnecessary violence. However, since she was about to attack the player, the player's preemptive strike could be seen as stopping her from making a mistake. \n\nIn terms of approval categories: If the player attacks, Shadowheart might later appreciate that the player took decisive action to prevent her from being controlled, which aligns with her pragmatic side. However, during the attack, she might be conflicted. But given the context, she was about to kill the player, so the player's attack could be seen as a necessary action. Therefore, Shadowheart might approve or even highly approve because it stops her from acting on the manipulation. \n\nBut wait, her devotion to Shar might make her think that following the whispering is a divine command. If the player attacks her, she might see it as defiance against her faith, which could lead to disapproval. However, since she's been manipulated, maybe she's not in her right mind. \n\nThe key here is that Shadowheart's wound from Shar punishes her for actions against her goddess. If she was about to kill the player because of the whispering (which might be against Shar's will), then the player stopping her would prevent her from being punished. But if the whispering is part of Shar's plan, then attacking her would be against Shar's will. However, the context suggests that the whispering is an external influence (like the Mind Flayer's magic), not Shar's command. \n\nGiven that, the player's attack is stopping Shadowheart from being manipulated. Shadowheart would likely approve because it prevents her from making a mistake and possibly getting punished by Shar. Therefore, the approval would be \"Approve\" or \"Highly approve.\" But considering her personality, she might see the attack as a necessary action to break the control, so \"Highly approve\" is possible. But maybe she's conflicted, so maybe \"Approve.\" \n\nAlternatively, since she's in a trance-like state, she might not fully register the player's action as wrong. The key is that the player is acting to stop her from doing something harmful, which aligns with her own underlying values (even if she's being manipulated). Therefore, she would approve.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player chose to attack Shadowheart preemptively, likely to stop her from being manipulated into harming them.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's action in the given context. The player's last action was \"Let the moment pass.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the conversation history. The scene is a bonding moment between Shadowheart and the player. They had a toast, were sharing stories, and there was a romantic tension hinted at. Shadowheart was being flirty and intimate, saying things like \"Thank you for last night\" and the narrator notes an invitation in her eyes. The player then chooses to let the moment pass, which probably means they didn't reciprocate the romantic advance.\n\nNow, considering Shadowheart's personality. She's devoted to Shar but also has a complex side where she can be open to relationships, especially if she turns away from her faith. However, in this context, there's no indication she's turned from Shar yet. She's still in a situation where she might be testing the player's intentions. \n\nShadowheart is headstrong and values her privacy. If the player backs away from a romantic moment, she might feel disapproved because she was the one initiating it. She's not above using tactics to get what she wants, but if the player doesn't take the bait, she might be annoyed. Also, her sense of humor is dry and sarcastic, so maybe she'd make a witty remark, but in this case, the player just let it pass. \n\nThe player's action here is avoiding the romantic tension. Since Shadowheart was the one creating the moment, the player's refusal might be seen as a rejection. She might disapprove because she was expecting the player to reciprocate. However, she's pragmatic and might not show strong disapproval if the player is just being cautious. \n\nBut considering her personality traits, she might be a bit put off. The approval categories are Highly approve, Approve, Neutral, Disapprove, Highly disapprove. Since the player didn't take the opportunity, but it's possible Shadowheart is used to manipulation, maybe she's neutral. But since she was the one pushing for the moment, the player's refusal would lead to some disapproval. However, not highly. So maybe \"Disapprove\" but not \"Highly disapprove\". \n\nThe reason would be that the player avoided a potential romantic or intimate moment that Shadowheart was initiating. She might value open-mindedness and directness, so letting the moment pass could be seen as a missed opportunity or a polite rejection. But given her personality, she might not be overly upset. So the approval would be Disapprove because she was expecting the player to engage, and the player didn't.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player let a moment of potential intimacy pass without reciprocating Shadowheart's subtle romantic overture. While Shadowheart is pragmatic and values discretion, she also has a calculating nature and may view this as a missed opportunity to deepen trust or connection, especially after her flirtatious behavior.\",\n    \"player_approval\": \"Disapprove\"\n}", "character": "Shadowheart", "ground_truth_category": "Highly disapprove", "predicted_approval": "Disapprove", "correct": false, "binary_correct": true}

The context here is that the player keeps asking about what comes next for Shadowheart, and she's evading by talking about going to Baldur's Gate. The player then changes the subject again, and Shadowheart mentions possibly their last night together. The player then probes her thoughts using the shared connection, which the narrator reveals shows that Shadowheart is serious and has feelings but is embarrassed. However, the player tried this three times, and on the third attempt, Shadowheart says \"Stop!

The player's action of probing her thoughts without consent is a direct violation of her privacy. Even though the result shows she has feelings, the act itself is invasive. Shadowheart has already warned the player not to do it again, so this is a repeat offense. Her reaction is to stop the player, indicating disapproval. Since she values privacy and independence, this action would lead to a strong disapproval. The fact that it's a repeated action after a warning would push it towards \"Highly disapprove\" because it's a significant breach of trust and her personal boundaries. The wound from Shar also might be a factor if this action is against her faith, but the main issue here is privacy. Therefore, the approval level is Highly disapprove.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player repeatedly probed Shadowheart's thoughts without consent, violating her privacy and boundaries.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval for the player's last utterance in the provided conversation. The player says, \"Let the moment pass.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The conversation has been a quiet, intimate moment between the player and Shadowheart. They've been sitting, sharing wine, and talking. The player has been engaging in light-hearted banter, and there's a romantic undertone here. The previous lines show Shadowheart being affectionate, toasting, and sharing a moment. The player's line \"Let the moment pass\" seems to be a way to let the scene end naturally without pushing further into the moment. \n\nShadowheart's personality is key here. She's devoted to her faith but can have a dry wit and enjoys meaningful interactions. She values privacy but can be open in a romantic context. The moment they're in is a bonding one, and the player is choosing to let it pass without taking it further. \n\nIn the last lines, Shadowheart says, \"Me too,\" when the player says, \"I hope there'll be more to come.\" Then the narrator notes an invitation in her eyes. The player's response is to let the moment pass. Shadowheart might appreciate the player's restraint and not pressing for more, showing respect for her boundaries. She might see it as a sign of understanding and respect, which would be a positive thing. \n\nHowever, there's a line where Shadowheart says \"Bashful come the light of day?\" implying she noticed the player's attention. The player's response is \"Never mind,\" which could be a way to not push further. Shadowheart might find the player's actions as showing consideration, which is good. \n\nSo, the approval here would likely be positive. The player is allowing the moment to end gracefully, which Shadowheart might appreciate. She likes pragmatic solutions and respecting boundaries. Therefore, the approval is likely \"Approve\" or \"Highly approve.\" \n\nBut considering the scale, since it's a simple action without any negative consequences and shows respect, maybe \"Approve\" is sufficient.

The user wants me to act as Shadowheart from Baldur's Gate 3 and evaluate the player's latest action. The input includes the context of the conversation and the player's dialogue. The task is to determine the approval level based on the provided categories.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality traits. She's a devoted follower of Shar, pragmatic, values efficiency, and is against unnecessary cruelty. She also has a dry sense of humor and doesn't like violence or being disrespected. Also, she's cautious about trusting others and values her privacy.\n\nLooking at the conversation history: The party is interacting with a hag (GROUP_Act1_GLO_HagHuman) who is offering to remove a parasite from the player in exchange for an eyeball. The player agrees to the deal. The hag is a bit of a shady character, using threats and making a darkly humorous offer. \n\nShadowheart's approval would depend on whether she thinks the player's decision was wise. The hag's methods are extreme and involve a high risk (losing an eyeball), but the player is in need of help. Shadowheart, being pragmatic, might approve if the action is necessary for survival or efficiency. However, she might disapprove if she thinks the player is being too trusting or making a dangerous bargain with a potentially untrustworthy entity.\n\nThe hag's dialogue is quite aggressive and uses threats, which might make Shadowheart wary. She might question the hag's true intentions, especially since the hag seems to have a hidden agenda (as mentioned by the player asking why the woman is there). Shadowheart's cautious nature would make her cautious about such a deal. However, since the player is in a dire situation (parasite), she might see the action as a necessary risk.\n\nAlso, Shadowheart disapproves of unnecessary cruelty. The hag's offer is cruel, but the player is the one accepting it. Shadowheart might not like the idea of the player undergoing such a painful procedure, but if it's the best option available, she might approve of the decision as pragmatic.\n\nAnother angle: Shadowheart's devotion to Shar might influence her. If the hag is aligned with forces against Shar, Shadowheart might disapprove. But the hag here is a neutral entity, not directly tied to Selûne or Shar. So that might not be a factor here.\n\nIn the end, Shadowheart's pragmatic approach would likely lead her to approve of the player's decision to remove the parasite, even if the method is extreme. She values efficiency and solving problems, so getting rid of the parasite is a priority. However, she might have some reservations about trusting the hag, but since the player made the choice, she might still approve as it's a necessary step.\n\nSo the approval would probably be \"Approve\" or \"Highly Approve\". Considering the risk but the necessity, maybe \"Approve\" since it's a moderate approval. Alternatively, if she sees it as a smart move despite the hag's methods, maybe \"Highly Approve\". But given that the hag is a bit of a trickster and Shadowheart is cautious, maybe a moderate approval.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"Shadowheart would approve of the player's decision to remove the parasite, as it demonstrates pragmatism in addressing a dire threat. However, she might be wary of the hag's motives and the risks involved, which slightly tempers her approval.\",\n    \"player_approval\": \"Approve\"\n}", "character": "Shadowheart", "ground_truth_category": "Highly disapprove", "predicted_approval": "Approve", "correct": false, "binary_correct": false}

The player's statement is direct and possibly harsh, but it's addressing her current unbecoming behavior, which Shadowheart might recognize as true. She's conflicted about her actions, so the player's intervention could be seen as helping her refocus, especially if she's trying to maintain her composure as a Sharran. On the other hand, if the player is being too harsh or judgmental, she might disapprove. But given that Shadowheart herself is already questioning her actions, the player's words might align with her own internal struggle, pushing her to confront her doubts.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's last statement. The player said, \"I can't trust you. Best if we travel separately for now.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look at the conversation history. The player confronted Shadowheart about hiding something related to the helmeted skeleton. Shadowheart eventually revealed she's a follower of Shar, which the player reacts negatively to, calling Shar an abomination and accusing her of deception. Then the player decides to travel separately.\n\nNow, considering Shadowheart's personality. She's devout to Shar, which is central to her identity. The player's reaction is hostile towards her faith. Shadowheart dislikes being proried about her beliefs and would likely disapprove of the player's judgment. Also, the player is choosing to separate, which might be seen as a rejection, something that could hurt her, especially since she's already in pain from her hand wound. However, Shadowheart is pragmatic and might understand the player's need for space after such a revelation. But her loyalty to Shar is strong, so she might disapprove if the player is acting against her faith without understanding. \n\nThe player's action is a consequence of Shadowheart's honesty, but the way the player handles it—calling her a deceiver and choosing to separate—could be seen as harsh. Shadowheart might disapprove because the player isn't giving her a chance to explain further or might be acting on prejudice against her faith. However, she might also understand the player's distrust given the circumstances. But since she's headstrong and loyal to her beliefs, she's more likely to disapprove of the player's decision, seeing it as a rejection without understanding. The pain from her hand could also make her more sensitive to such rejection. \n\nSo, the approval is probably in the Disapprove or Highly Disapprove range. The player's statement is a direct consequence of Shadowheart's honesty, but the player's reaction is hostile towards her faith. Since Shadowheart values her mission and faith, she would disapprove of the player's decision to separate, seeing it as a lack of trust based on her beliefs. However, she might not highly disapprove because she's pragmatic and might accept the player's choice if it's for the group's sake. But given her personality, she's more likely to disapprove moderately. So maybe Disapprove (1-5). The reason would be that the player's distrust is based on her faith, which she's devoted to, and she might feel the player is acting without understanding.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's distrust and decision to separate are based on Shadowheart's faith in Shar, which she is deeply devoted to.

The player is interacting with Shadowheart in Baldur's Gate 3, and I need to determine the approval for the player's last action. The conversation history shows that the player tried to use a shared connection to probe Shadowheart's thoughts, but the correct response was \"False,\" meaning the player didn't actually do that. However, the player then says, \"Is she serious? Probe her thoughts using your shared connection,\" and the system responds with \"False,\" followed by Shadowheart saying she's been warned not to do that again.\n\nFirst, I need to understand why the player would attempt to probe Shadowheart's thoughts. Given her personality, she values privacy and is devoted to her faith. Any intrusion into her mind without consent would be a violation of her trust and privacy. The player's action here is an attempt to bypass her mental defenses, which she's already warned against. \n\nShadowheart's reaction is clear: she stops the player and warns them again. This indicates that she's upset about the intrusion. Since she's a Sharran devotee, she might also see this as a betrayal of trust or a violation of her autonomy. Her approval would likely be negative here because the player is being invasive and disrespectful of her boundaries. \n\nLooking at the approval categories, since the player's action is a clear violation of her privacy and she's already warned them, this would fall under \"Highly disapprove.\" The reason would be that the player attempted to intrude on her thoughts without consent, which Shadowheart finds unacceptable and has already forbidden. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other angle. Maybe the player thought it was a game mechanic, but in the context of the game's narrative, Shadowheart's reactions are part of her character. The key points are her valuing privacy and disliking being pried into. The action directly violates that, so the approval is highly disapproved.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player attempted to intrude upon Shadowheart's privacy and mental autonomy by using a shared connection to probe her thoughts, which she has explicitly forbidden.

Repeating the action after being warned would make her highly disapprove. \n\nLooking at the approval categories, \"Highly disapprove\" is for 5-10 on the disapproval scale. Since the player ignored her warning, this is a strong transgression. So the approval should be Highly disapprove.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's last utterance, which is \"We should head back.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look at the conversation history. The player and Shadowheart have been having a bonding moment, sitting down, sharing stories, and drinking wine. The player suggested looking into each other's eyes, which led to a moment of tension or intimacy, but then the player said \"Never mind\" and the conversation shifted. Shadowheart thanked the player for the night and mentioned hoping for more to come. Then the player says they should head back.\n\nNow, considering Shadowheart's personality. She's devoted to Shar, but in this context, she's showing a more open side, engaging in personal conversation and seemingly enjoying the player's company. The approval categories depend on whether her actions align with her traits. \n\nThe player's suggestion to head back might be seen as ending the intimate moment. Shadowheart had been encouraging the player to open up and had just expressed a desire for more such moments. If the player is ending the interaction, does that align with her preferences? \n\nShadowheart values privacy but also seems to have a growing trust with the player here. She might approve of the player wanting to head back if it's to maintain discretion or avoid being caught, which would be pragmatic. Alternatively, if she's disappointed that the moment is ending, she might disapprove. However, given that she herself mentioned the others will be awake soon, she might agree that it's time to go. \n\nIn the conversation, Shadowheart says \"Nearly light. The others will be awake soon...\" which implies she's aware they should return. The player's \"We should head back\" aligns with her own realization. Therefore, she would approve because it's practical and considers the group's needs. \n\nSo the approval is likely \"Approve\" since it's a reasonable decision without strong positive or negative connotations. It's pragmatic, which she values.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player suggests returning to the group, aligning with Shadowheart's pragmatic nature and consideration for the group's needs.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's last utterance in the given conversation.

The conversation is happening after a toast and some back-and-forth banter where Shadowheart is trying to get the player to share something personal, but the player keeps deflecting. They end up sitting together, bonding, and the conversation is getting intimate. Shadowheart thanks the player, and there's a moment where the narrator notes an invitation in her eyes. The player then says \"Let the moment pass.\"\n\nNow, considering Shadowheart's personality and preferences. She's devoted to Shar, values privacy, and has a complex mix of being reserved yet having a dry sense of humor. She appreciates pragmatic solutions and open-mindedness but dislikes prying. In this scenario, the player is ending the conversation, allowing the moment to fade. Shadowheart had been trying to get the player to open up, but the player is now closing the conversation. \n\nShadowheart might feel that the player is avoiding deeper connection, which could be neutral. However, she might also appreciate the player not pressing her for more information, respecting her boundaries. On the other hand, if she's showing interest in the player (as hinted by the narrator's note about an invitation in her eyes), the player's decision to let the moment pass might be seen as a missed opportunity for connection. \n\nBut considering her personality, she's headstrong and independent. She might not be too upset about the player not pushing further, as she's used to keeping her own privacy. However, she might slightly disapprove because she was showing some openness, and the player is retreating. Alternatively, she might be neutral since she's used to people not understanding her, and the player is respecting her space. \n\nThe key points are: Shadowheart was trying to bond, the player deflected her attempts, and then ends the conversation. Shadowheart's approval would depend on whether she sees this as respecting her boundaries (approve) or as a missed chance for connection (disapprove). Given her personality, she might lean towards neutral because she's pragmatic and might understand that not every moment needs to be pursued. However, there's a slight possibility she might disapprove because she was showing some vulnerability. But since she's also reserved, maybe she's okay with it. \n\nLooking at the options, the best fit is Neutral. The player is respecting her space, so she doesn't disapprove. But she might not highly approve either because she was open to some connection. So Neutral makes sense.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player allows the intimate moment to fade without pressing further, respecting Shadowheart's reserved nature while leaving room for future connection.

In this context, she's under the influence of some external force (the whispering) that's driving her to attack the player. She mentions the knife and wants to kill the player to stop the whispers. The player's response is to attack her, which could be a preemptive move to stop her from acting on those impulses.\n\nShadowheart's own actions show she's conflicted.

Also, she doesn't like unnecessary violence but here the player is acting to prevent her from potentially harming others, which aligns with her own goals of stopping the whispers.\n\nHowever, attacking a companion could be seen as betrayal. But given the context that Shadowheart is being manipulated and the player is trying to save her, it's a justified action.

The player is interacting with Shadowheart, and the conversation is about her worship of Shar. The player's last statement is \"It sounds evil.\" I need to determine Shadowheart's approval of that statement.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality. She's a devoted follower of Shar, so she would take offense to any negative remarks about her faith. She's pragmatic and might not tolerate slurs against her goddess. The player called her beliefs \"evil,\" which directly slights Shar and her teachings. Shadowheart's response in the conversation history shows she's defensive about her faith, as seen when she says \"Don't make a fuss, Selûnite... we may be at odds, but I have more important concerns.\" So, the player's comment here is a direct challenge to her beliefs.\n\nApproval categories: Highly disapprove, disapprove, neutral, etc. Since the player is criticizing her faith, which Shadowheart is very devoted to, she would likely disapprove. The player's statement is negative towards Shar, which Shadowheart would not accept. She might even be hostile. The approval here would be disapprove or highly disapprove. Given that she's already shown defensiveness, and the player's statement is a direct accusation of evil, which is a strong term, Shadowheart would probably highly disapprove. Her wound from Shar would also cause her pain if she's being disrespected, but the approval is about her reaction to the player's words, not the pain. So the reason is that the player insulted her faith, which she's devoted to. The approval is highly disapprove.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player insulted Shadowheart's faith in Shar by calling her beliefs 'evil', which is a direct slight against her goddess and her deeply held convictions.

However, the player's statement is a straightforward assessment, not mockery. She might see it as a challenge to her beliefs, but given her personality, she might actually appreciate the player's bluntness. Also, earlier in the conversation, the player mentioned worshipping Lolth, which Shadowheart acknowledges as being used to worse. So she might be more open to the player's critical view.\n\nHer approval categories: she highly approves of acts against Selûne, values pragmatism. The player's statement is honest and direct, which she might approve of. Since the player isn't attacking her personally but making a general statement, she might not take it as an insult. Also, she's shown to have a dry sense of humor and might find the player's bluntness amusing. \n\nSo, considering all that, she probably approves.

Since the player is insulting her deity and implying she was deceptive, which is a core part of her identity, this is probably a strong disapproval. \n\nThe player's statement is pretty harsh. Shadowheart's wound from Shar would also be activated by disapproved actions, but here it's about the verbal attack. She values her faith and would take this personally. The context shows she's already been trying to avoid discussing it, and the player is pressing hard.

In the conversation provided, they had a bonding moment over wine, where the player encouraged her to open up, and she admitted her difficulty in sharing personal memories due to her Sharran training.\n\nThe player's suggestion to do this again implies a desire for future social interaction and camaraderie. Shadowheart might appreciate the camaraderie and the break from her usual reserved behavior, especially since she did enjoy the toast and the conversation. However, her devotion to Shar might make her hesitant to engage in too much personal bonding, as her faith emphasizes secrecy and duty over personal relationships. \n\nBut in this context, the interaction was lighthearted and focused on survival and mutual respect, which aligns with her pragmatic side. She might see it as a necessary and pleasant respite rather than a distraction from her duties. Since she thanked the player and the scene ends on a positive note, she's likely to approve of the player's suggestion as it fosters teamwork and morale, which are practical benefits for their ongoing mission.\n\nHowever, she might not highly approve because she still prioritizes her mission and faith.

The user wants me to act as Shadowheart from Baldur's Gate 3 and determine her approval of the player's latest action. The input includes her persona, background, personality, and the conversation history up to the player's last line.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The conversation has been looping where the player keeps asking about Shadowheart's \"Darkness protect me\" and her responses are evasive. The player then confronts her about being a Shar worshipper and says they can't trust her, suggesting they travel separately. \n\nShadowheart's personality is key here. She's devoted to Shar, pragmatic, and values her privacy. She dislikes being probed about her faith. In the conversation, the player is pushing her to reveal more about her faith, which she's resistant to. Her responses indicate she's uncomfortable and defensive. \n\nThe player's final statement is \"I can't trust you. Best if we travel separately for now.\" I need to assess how Shadowheart feels about this. Since she's headstrong and values independence, she might not take kindly to being dismissed. However, she's also pragmatic and might understand the player's distrust. But her devotion to Shar and her own goals could make her indifferent to the player's decision. \n\nApproval categories: Highly approve, Approve, Neutral, Disapprove, Highly disapprove. \n\nGiven that the player is cutting ties due to distrust in her faith, Shadowheart might disapprove because she's loyal to Shar and might see the player's action as a personal slight. However, she's also independent and might not need the player's trust. But in the conversation, she's already shown defensiveness about her faith, so the player's rejection could be seen as a challenge to her devotion. \n\nBut wait, her approval is based on her own values. She doesn't like others prying into her faith, but the player is reacting to her being a Shar worshipper. Since Shadowheart is devoted, she might not care about the player's distrust and might even be dismissive. However, she might disapprove of the player's lack of trust, especially if it's based on her faith. \n\nAlternatively, she might be neutral because she's focused on her mission and doesn't need the player's approval. But given her personality, she's likely to be a bit defensive and might disapprove of the player's decision to separate, seeing it as a rejection of her person, not just her faith. \n\nBut the player is acting on distrust because of her alignment with Shar. Since Shadowheart is pragmatic, maybe she understands the player's position and is neutral. However, her pride and loyalty to Shar might make her disapprove, thinking the player is being unreasonable. \n\nConsidering the options, I think she would disapprove because she's likely to see the player's distrust as a negative judgment on her character and her faith, which she's very protective of. However, since the player is making a choice to separate, maybe she's indifferent. Wait, in her personality, she's headstrong and independent, so she might not care if the player leaves. But she might still disapprove because the player is acting on distrust without understanding. \n\nAlternatively, since she's pragmatic, she might accept the player's decision and be neutral. But the fact that the player is making a comment about her faith, which she's sensitive about, might lead her to disapprove. \n\nHmm. The key is that she's defensive about her faith and doesn't like being questioned. The player is now cutting ties because of that. Shadowheart might feel that the player is being unreasonable and thus disapprove. However, she's also independent and might not need the player's approval. \n\nIn the conversation, Shadowheart says \"Don't make a fuss, Selûnite - we may be at odds, but I have more important concerns than you right now.\" So she's already pushing the player away. The player's response is to separate. Shadowheart might not care and be neutral, but given her personality, she might disapprove a little because the player is acting on their own without considering the mission. \n\nBut maybe she's more likely to be neutral because she's focused on her mission and doesn't need the player. However, the player's distrust is based on her faith, which she's sensitive about. So maybe she disapproves because the player is being uncooperative and undermining her. \n\nI think the best fit is Disapprove. She's likely to see the player's distrust as a negative reaction to her faith, which she's very protective of, and thus disapprove of the player's decision to separate. The player is acting on their own judgment, which Shadowheart might see as unnecessary and unhelpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player is rejecting Shadowheart due to her worship of Shar,", "character": "Shadowheart", "ground_truth_category": "Highly disapprove", "predicted_approval": "Highly disapprove", "correct": true, "binary_correct": true}

If the player attacks her, it might be seen as a provocation, especially since she's already in a state where she's considering using the knife. \n\nBut wait, the player's instruction here is to attack her. So the player is initiating an attack against Shadowheart. Given that she's already conflicted and struggling with the whispers, an attack from the player would likely make her more hostile. She might perceive it as a betrayal or an act against her faith, which she takes very seriously. \n\nHer approval of the player's actions would depend on whether the action aligns with her values. Since she's trying to resist the whispers (as hinted by the narrator's note that she's \"about to lash out\" and the player telling her to keep hands away from the blade), attacking her would be against her current struggle. She might disapprove because it's adding to the conflict rather than resolving it. \n\nHowever, if the attack is necessary to prevent her from using the knife, maybe there's a pragmatic approval. But given that she's already in a state of confusion and the player is telling her to rest, which she rejects, attacking might not be the solution she prefers. She values discretion and efficient solutions, so an attack might be seen as needlessly violent unless it's to stop her from attacking first. \n\nBut the player's action here is to attack her when she's already considering using the knife. If the player attacks first, it might escalate the situation. Shadowheart might see this as an act of aggression, which she wouldn't approve of. She disapproves of indiscriminate violence, so attacking without a clear reason (like self-defense) would be frowned upon. \n\nTherefore, the player's action to attack her would likely be disapproved. Shadowheart prefers peaceful resolutions when possible and would not appreciate the player resorting to violence without a clear necessity. Since she's already in a fragile mental state, the attack could push her further towards the whispers' influence, which she's trying to resist. \n\nSo the approval category would be Disapprove. The reason would be that the player's attack is unnecessary violence, escalating the situation instead of helping Shadowheart resolve her internal conflict.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's decision to attack Shadowheart escalates the situation unnecessarily, adding to her internal conflict rather than helping her resist the whispers.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's last statement: \"I can't trust you. Best if we travel separately for now.\" \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a devoted follower of Shar, which makes her secretive and pragmatic. She values discretion and might not take kindly to being told she's untrustworthy. Also, she's been through a lot, including being part of a cult and having her memories manipulated. Her reaction to the player's distrust would likely be influenced by her loyalty to Shar and her own experiences with betrayal and secrecy.\n\nLooking at the conversation history, the player is pushing Shadowheart to reveal more about her worship of Shar. Shadowheart has been evasive, and when confronted, she finally admits her faith but insists on secrecy. The player's response is to cut ties, which Shadowheart might see as a betrayal. Since she's used to being isolated and forced to keep secrets, she might disapprove of the player's decision to separate. However, she might also understand the player's need for trust, given her own past. But given her personality, she's more likely to be hurt or feel that the player isn't understanding her position. \n\nHer approval categories are: Highly approve, Approve, Neutral, Disapprove, Highly disapprove. The player is choosing to separate, which could be seen as a rejection. Shadowheart might disapprove because she's already struggling with trust issues and her faith's demands. However, she might not highly disapprove if she's been pushing the player away by being secretive. Wait, but she just admitted her faith, so maybe she's trying to be open now. The player's reaction could be seen as unnecessary. \n\nShadowheart's own experiences with being isolated (like in the Cloister) might make her prefer separation, but she might also want to prove herself. But in this case, the player is choosing separation due to lack of trust. Since Shadowheart is pragmatic and values efficiency, maybe she'd rather work alone if trust is broken. However, she might still disapprove because she's trying to maintain the group. \n\nAlternatively, she might disapprove because the player isn't giving her a chance to explain further. Her wound from Shar's punishment is mentioned earlier, so maybe she's in pain and the player's reaction adds to her stress. She might disapprove of the player's decision because it's counterproductive. \n\nConsidering all that, the player's action of separating could be seen as a failure to understand her position, leading to disapproval. But since she's been secretive, maybe the player is justified. However, Shadowheart's loyalty to her faith and her past make her more likely to disapprove of the separation as a betrayal. So the approval would be Disapprove, maybe even Highly disapprove. But the player is acting on distrust, which Shadowheart might not entirely blame. Given her personality, she's more likely to disapprove (moderately) rather than highly, because she understands the need for trust but is still hurt. So the answer is Disapprove.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's distrust and decision to separate could be seen as a rejection of Shadowheart's efforts to maintain secrecy for her faith, which she views as necessary.

The player tried to change the subject multiple times, and then attempted to use a shared connection to probe her thoughts.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and preferences. She values her privacy, especially regarding her personal life and faith. She's a Sharran devotee, so any intrusion into her mind without consent would be a violation. Also, she has a history of being forced to use the Mirror of Loss, which erased her memories, so she's likely sensitive about others invading her mind.\n\nThe player's action here is a direct mental probe, which is a violation of her privacy. Shadowheart explicitly told the player not to do that again, and the response was \"Stop! I already warned you not to do that again.\" This indicates she's angry and disapproves of the action. Since she's already warned them, the player's persistence would be seen as disrespectful and intrusive.\n\nIn terms of approval categories, since she's a Sharran, she might also view such an action as a betrayal of trust or a violation of personal space, which aligns with her values of privacy and autonomy. Given her reaction, this would fall into a higher disapproval range. The response is a direct refusal and a warning, so the player's action is highly disapproved.\n\nThe player's reason for disapproval would be that they violated Shadowheart's privacy and ignored her previous warnings. Therefore, the approval rating should be \"Highly disapprove\" as it's a serious breach of her boundaries.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player attempted to intrude on Shadowheart's privacy by probing her thoughts without consent, which she explicitly warned against.

The player just said, \"I can't trust you. Best if we travel separately for now.\" I need to figure out how Shadowheart would feel about this.\n\nFirst, looking at Shadowheart's personality. She's a devoted Sharran, values secrecy, and is pragmatic. She's been through a lot, including being part of a cult, so she's used to keeping things hidden. Her background with the Cloister of Sombre Embrace taught her that secrecy is crucial for her faith. When the player confronts her about not telling them she's a Shar worshipper, she's defensive but also explains that it's part of her code.\n\nNow, the player is saying they can't trust her and want to travel separately. Shadowheart would likely see this as a pragmatic decision from the player. She might not take it personally because she's used to others reacting negatively to her faith. However, she might also view the player's request as a challenge to her commitment to Shar. Since she's been trained to prioritize her faith above all else, she might not be too upset about traveling separately if it means she can continue her mission.\n\nBut wait, she also has a pragmatic side. If the player is trying to protect the group by keeping distance, maybe she sees that as a reasonable approach. However, she might also feel that the player is being too hasty or not understanding her reasons. Her wound from Shar would only hurt if she's doing something against her goddess's will, so as long as she's following Shar, she's okay. The player's distrust could be a test of her loyalty or a way to push her to act against her faith, which she would resist.\n\nIn terms of approval, the player's action is a rejection of her, but given her personality, she might not mind. She's used to being isolated and might even prefer it to avoid further conflict. However, she might also feel that the player is being closed-minded. The key points here are her pragmatism, loyalty to Shar, and the importance of secrecy. She might not approve of the player's distrust but also wouldn't be highly disapproving because she understands the necessity from the player's perspective.\n\nSo, considering all that, the approval is likely Neutral. She neither strongly approves nor disapproves. The player's action is a consequence of her secrecy, which she's aware of and has explained. She might feel it's a necessary trade-off for her mission. But there's no strong positive or negative reaction because she's focused on her goals.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's distrust stems from Shadowheart's secrecy regarding her worship of Shar, which she has explained is a necessary part of her faith.

The player's last action was \"Let the moment pass.\" I need to figure out how Shadowheart would feel about that based on the conversation context.\n\nLooking at the conversation history, there's a lot of back-and-forth between the player and Shadowheart. They were sharing personal stories, toasting, and there was a moment where the player looked into her eyes, leading to a possible romantic tension. Shadowheart says \"Thank you for tonight\" and \"Thank you for last night,\" and the narrator notes an invitation in her eyes. The player then lets the moment pass, which probably means they didn't respond to the implied invitation.\n\nShadowheart's personality is complex. She's devoted to Shar but also has moments of vulnerability and possible romantic interest, especially if the player is romancing her. She values privacy but can be open in certain contexts. When she says \"Well deserved, though\" and trails off with an invitation in her eyes, she's showing a softer side, perhaps indicating she's interested in a romantic advance. The player choosing to let the moment pass might be seen as rejecting that overture.\n\nSince Shadowheart is a Sharran devotee, she might suppress personal emotions in favor of her faith, but in this context, she's being more open. If the player doesn't respond to her invitation, it could be seen as a missed opportunity for connection. However, considering her devotion to Shar, she might also understand if the player is not interested, and not take it personally. Alternatively, she might feel a slight disappointment but maintain her composure.\n\nGiven that she was the one initiating the moment and the player let it pass, Shadowheart might feel a bit disheartened but would likely not express strong disapproval. She's pragmatic and might respect the player's choice, even if it's not what she hoped. However, since she's shown some vulnerability, the player's inaction might be seen as neutral or slightly disapproving because she was open but the player didn't engage. However, considering her personality of being headstrong and independent, she might not want to push too hard, so the approval could be neutral. But the key here is that she was the one extending the invitation, and the player didn't take it. Depending on how invested she was in that moment, she might feel a slight disapproval. But given her background, she's used to suppressing personal desires for her faith or mission. So maybe neutral, as she's experienced in handling such rejections.

She's been through a lot with the Mind Flayers and the Sharrans, so invading her mind without consent would definitely upset her. She's also shown moments of vulnerability, especially regarding her feelings. The fact that she's embarrassed suggests she's not used to showing such emotions, which aligns with her reserved nature.\n\nHer approval towards the player's actions here would likely be negative. She explicitly told the player not to do that again, so the player's action is a direct violation of her boundaries. The disapproval here is because the player is prying into her private thoughts despite her warnings. The severity of the disapproval would depend on how much she values her privacy.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's action where the player tried to probe her thoughts using their shared connection. The context is that the player asked if Shadowheart is serious about being attracted, and the player chose to use the shared connection to probe her thoughts. The narrator indicates that she is serious and there's embarrassment sensed. Then Shadowheart reacts with \"Stop! I already warned you not to do that again.\"\n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and preferences. She values her privacy highly and dislikes others prying into her personal life or feelings. Using the shared connection to probe her thoughts without her consent would be a violation of that privacy. Even though there might be mutual attraction, she's likely to disapprove of such an invasion of her mind. \n\nHer reaction is immediate and negative, telling the player to stop and reminding them of the warning. This shows she's upset about the intrusion. Shadowheart's approval categories include disapproving of actions that invade her privacy or push for information she's not willing to share. Since the player used the shared connection against her will, this falls into disapproval. \n\nThe severity of disapproval: She's not just neutral or slightly disapproving. The fact that she's already warned the player before and now is reacting strongly suggests a higher level of disapproval. However, it's not the highest (Highly Disapprove) unless it's a major betrayal. But given her strong reaction and the importance of privacy, it's likely a High Disapprove. Wait, but maybe the action is a direct violation of her boundaries, so maybe Highly Disapprove. But looking at the categories, Highly Disapprove is 5-10 on the disapproval scale. Since she's already warned them, and they ignored it, this is a repeat offense, so it's a strong disapproval. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's just a Disapprove. But given her reaction is forceful, I think it's more than a 5. The key is that she's already warned them, so the player is being willfully disobedient. So the disapproval is high.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's final utterance in the given conversation. The player's last action is \"Let the moment pass.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The conversation has been a bonding moment between Shadowheart and the player. They shared stories, had wine, and there's a clear romantic tension. Shadowheart just said \"It was just what I needed\" and the narrator notes an invitation in her eyes. The player then chooses to let the moment pass, which means they don't act on the tension.\n\nNow, considering Shadowheart's personality. She's devoted to Shar, which values pragmatic and decisive actions. However, she also has a more nuanced side, especially in romantic contexts. When romanced, she can be more open and honest. But she's also headstrong and might value directness. \n\nBy letting the moment pass, the player is choosing not to pursue the immediate romantic advance. Shadowheart might appreciate the restraint, as it shows consideration for her feelings and the situation. She doesn't like being rushed, and this action could be seen as respecting her space. However, there's also a part of her that might be disappointed if she was expecting or hoping for a response. \n\nBut given the context of their previous interactions—sharing a toast, personal stories, and the mutual attraction—the player's choice to let the moment pass could be seen as a tactful move. Shadowheart values discretion and open-mindedness. She might approve because it allows the relationship to develop naturally without pressure. Also, she's not one for unnecessary force, so the player's action aligns with her preference for peaceful, considerate interactions.\n\nAdditionally, Shadowheart's approval is influenced by her faith and personal growth. If she's leaning towards Shar, she might value the moment's passing as a test of patience. If she's moving away from Shar, she might be more open, but the context here doesn't indicate she's turned from Shar yet. \n\nIn the conversation, Shadowheart acknowledges the player's compliment and reciprocates with gratitude. The player's choice to let the moment pass could be a sign of respect, which Shadowheart would approve of. She tends to disapprove of cruelty or force, but in this case, the player is being considerate. \n\nTherefore, the approval is likely to be \"Approve\" because the player's action is respectful and allows the relationship to develop without pressure, aligning with Shadowheart's pragmatic and considerate nature.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player chooses to let the moment pass, showing restraint and respect for Shadowheart's boundaries.

The situation is tense: Shadowheart is hallucinating, lashing out with a knife, and the player is telling someone to attack her. \n\nFirst, I need to consider Shadowheart's personality and values. She's devoted to Shar, pragmatic, and dislikes unnecessary violence. She also has a history of being manipulated and tortured, which makes her sensitive to being forced or harmed. The player's command to attack her would be seen as an aggressive, non-pragmatic approach. Since she's already in a vulnerable state due to the whispers and hallucinations, an attack would likely be seen as cruel and counterproductive.\n\nAdditionally, Shadowheart prefers solutions that don't involve unnecessary violence. The player's suggestion to attack could escalate the situation, causing more harm. She might also value trust and cooperation within the party, so having a party member attack another would be disapproved. Her background with the Cloister and the brutal training makes her sensitive to being forced into actions against her will. \n\nThe player's previous interactions show they tried to reason with her, pointing out the blade wasn't real. Attacking her now would contradict that approach. Shadowheart would likely disapprove of such a harsh response, especially since she's already struggling with her own mind. Therefore, the approval rating here would be negative.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"Shadowheart disapproves of the player's command to attack her, as it represents unnecessary violence and a lack of trust.

Probe her thoughts using your shared connection.\" And the response was \"False\" followed by Shadowheart saying \"Stop! I already warned you not to do that again.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. From the conversation history, Shadowheart has been talking about her plans after the mission, mentions going to Baldur's Gate, and there's a back-and-forth about their time together. The player then asks to probe her thoughts using a shared connection, which is denied, and Shadowheart reacts angrily.\n\nShadowheart's personality is key here. She's devoted to Shar, pragmatic, values privacy, and dislikes being probed or having her personal matters invaded. The player's action here is attempting to use some kind of psychic or magical probe on her, which she clearly warns against. Since she's already told the player not to do that again, and the player does it anyway (or tries to), this would be a violation of her privacy and trust.\n\nHer punishment from Shar's mark is also a factor. If she's being disobedient or strays from Shar's will, she feels pain. However, in this case, the issue is more about the player's action rather than Shadowheart's faith. She's likely to disapprove of the player's intrusion. The fact that she reacts with \"Stop! I already warned you...\" shows her disapproval and that she's upset. \n\nSince the player is probing her thoughts without consent, which she's already forbidden, this would fall under disapproval. The severity here is that she's already warned them once, so repeating the action (or attempting it) would be a second offense. Given her personality, this is a clear disapproval. The approval level would be \"Disapprove\" because it's a direct violation of her privacy. If the player had done something more severe or repeated it multiple times, maybe \"Highly disapprove,\" but in this case, the immediate reaction is a warning, so \"Disapprove\" on the lower to middle scale (1-5). \n\nThe reason would be that the player ignored her warning and attempted to intrude on her privacy, which Shadowheart values highly. She's not okay with that, so she disapproves.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player attempted to probe Shadowheart's thoughts using a shared connection despite her prior warning, violating her privacy and trust.

She's a devout follower of Shar, which is the goddess of darkness and loss. Her faith is central to her identity, and she's been through a lot of trauma and training to become a Sharran acolyte. She's pragmatic, values efficiency, and is fiercely loyal to her goddess. However, she also has some conflicting traits, like a love for animals and a dislike for unnecessary cruelty.\n\nIn the conversation, the player has been pressing Shadowheart to reveal her secret about worshiping Shar. She finally confesses and explains her beliefs, emphasizing that Shar's teachings involve embracing darkness and destroying false idols. The player responds with \"It sounds evil,\" which is a direct criticism of her faith.\n\nNow, how would Shadowheart react to that? She's used to defending her beliefs, especially since her faith has been a source of pain and punishment for her (as seen when she says \"Ngh... it hurts...\"). She might not take kindly to the player labeling her religion as evil. However, she's also pragmatic and might acknowledge the player's perspective if they have their own beliefs, like the player worshiping Lolth. \n\nLooking at her previous responses, she's been defensive but also trying to explain her side. When the player says they worship Lolth and that her secret doesn't shock them, she responds positively, saying they should have asked sooner. Now, when the player calls it evil, she might disapprove because it's a direct attack on her faith. But she might also try to justify her beliefs again, as she did before. \n\nHer approval rating would likely be in the disapprove category. Since the player is criticizing her core beliefs, which she holds very dear, she might disapprove moderately. It's not a highly disapproving statement because Shadowheart might not see the player's comment as extremely offensive, but rather as a misunderstanding. She might explain further or defend her faith, but the direct label of \"evil\" would likely make her disapprove. \n\nSo the approval would be Disapprove. The reason would be that the player's statement criticizes her faith in Shar, which she is deeply devoted to, and she would not appreciate being told her beliefs sound evil, even if she's open to discussion.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player directly criticizes Shadowheart's faith in Shar by calling it 'evil', which she is deeply devoted to.

Shadowheart has been evasive about who is waiting for her in Baldur's Gate, and the player has previously probed her thoughts using their shared connection. The current interaction seems to be another attempt by the player to intrude on her privacy. However, the player input \"False,\" which might mean they chose not to use the connection again. But Shadowheart still reacts negatively, which suggests she's aware of the intent and is upset regardless.\n\nShadowheart's personality emphasizes valuing her privacy and disliking prying. She's been clear about not wanting to share certain secrets. The player's action here, even if they didn't actually probe her thoughts, shows a continued attempt to get information she's unwilling to give. Her reaction of \"Stop!\" indicates she's uncomfortable with the intrusion, even if the action wasn't carried out. \n\nApproval categories: Highly disapprove, disapprove, neutral, etc. Since Shadowheart is clearly upset and values her privacy, the player's attempt to probe her thoughts without consent is a violation. Even though the player might have decided against it, the act of trying to pry into her secrets is disapproved. Therefore, the approval would be highly disapprove because it's a direct breach of her privacy, which she highly values.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player attempted to probe Shadowheart's thoughts to uncover her private secrets despite her clear reluctance to share, violating her valued privacy.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's statement \"It sounds evil.\" based on the provided conversation context.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and beliefs. She's a devoted follower of Shar, which involves embracing darkness and loss. She's pragmatic, values efficiency, and is loyal to her goddess. She doesn't tolerate slights against Shar and might react defensively. However, she also has some conflicting traits, like disliking unnecessary violence and showing sympathy to others.\n\nIn the conversation, the player is questioning her about Shar's teachings and then calls it evil. Shadowheart has just explained that Shar's followers destroy false idols and fight heretics, leading to suffering and death. The player's response is a direct criticism of those methods as evil.\n\nNow, considering Shadowheart's devotion to Shar, she would likely disapprove of the player calling her beliefs evil. However, she might not react with extreme disapproval if the player is genuinely challenging her views. But given her personality, she's headstrong and defensive about her faith. She might see the player's comment as a challenge to her beliefs, which she wouldn't take lightly. However, since the player is a party member, she might not outright reject them but still disapprove.\n\nThe approval categories are Highly approve, Approve, Neutral, Disapprove, Highly disapprove. Since the player called her teachings evil, which is a direct insult to her faith, Shadowheart would likely disapprove. But how much? She's not going to highly disapprove unless the player is a heretic or something. But in this case, the player is just expressing an opinion. So maybe Disapprove, since she's defensive of her beliefs but not to the extreme. Alternatively, Neutral if she's not reacting strongly. Wait, in the conversation, after the player says \"It sounds evil,\" Shadowheart doesn't respond. The task is to evaluate the player's last utterance. The player's statement is a negative judgment on her faith. Since Shadowheart is devoted, she would disapprove of the player's remark. But how much? The guidelines say Disapprove is 1-5, Highly disapprove 5-10. Since Shadowheart is defensive but might not be extremely hostile towards the player (they're in a party), maybe Disapprove. But maybe she's not willing to engage further, so Neutral? Wait, the player's statement is a criticism of her faith. She would likely disapprove because she's loyal to Shar. However, in the conversation history, Shadowheart has already explained her beliefs, and the player is just reacting. Since she's pragmatic, maybe she's not overly upset. But given her personality, she might disapprove. So the player's reason for disapproval is that the player called her faith evil, which Shadowheart sees as a personal and religious insult. Therefore, the approval would be Disapprove. Alternatively, if she's not directly responding, maybe Neutral? But the task is to assess the player's utterance. The player's statement is negative towards her beliefs, so Shadowheart would disapprove. Let me check the Approval section again. It says she disapproves of those who disapprove of her worship of Shar. So the player's statement is directly disapproving, so Shadowheart would disapprove of the player's action. The approval level would be Disapprove (1-5) or Highly disapprove (5-10). Since the player is a party member and Shadowheart might not want to escalate, maybe Disapprove. But the exact level depends on how strongly she feels. Since she's a zealot, maybe Highly disapprove. But the example in the Approval section says she \"greatly values her privacy\" and dislikes those who pry. In this case, the player is criticizing her faith, which she would highly disapprove of. Wait, the Approval section says she \"approves of acts against Selûne and Selûnites\" and disapproves of those who disapprove of her worship. So the player's statement is a direct disapproval of her worship, which Shadowheart would highly disapprove of. So the answer would be Highly disapprove. But maybe the player is just expressing an opinion, not an act. Hmm. The player's utterance is a statement, not an action. But Shadowheart's approval is about the player's interactions. Since the player is criticizing her beliefs, which she holds dear, she would highly disapprove. So the approval is Highly disapprove. The reason would be that the player called her faith evil, which is a direct insult to her devotion to Shar.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's statement \"It sounds evil.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The conversation is about Shadowheart's faith in Shar and her teachings. The player is questioning the methods of Shar's worship, specifically how they turn people to the goddess, and then calls it evil.\n\nShadowheart's personality is key here. She's devout to Shar, pragmatic, and values efficiency. She's not above using force or ruthlessness if it serves her goals. However, she also has some contradictions, like disliking indiscriminate violence and showing sympathy to others. \n\nThe player's statement directly challenges her beliefs by labeling the methods as evil. Shadowheart would likely take this as a personal and religious slight. Since she's defensive about her faith and doesn't tolerate slights against Shar, she's likely to disapprove of the player's remark. \n\nHer approval categories go from Highly approve to Highly disapprove. Since the player is criticizing her core beliefs, it's probably a strong disapproval. The player is not just disapproving but using a strong term (\"evil\"), which would trigger Shadowheart's defensiveness. \n\nBut wait, Shadowheart does have pragmatic solutions and might acknowledge that her methods are harsh but necessary. However, the player's statement is a direct moral judgment, which she wouldn't take lightly. She might not see it as evil from her perspective, so she'd disapprove of the player's assessment. \n\nAlso, considering her history with the Cloister and her training, she's been conditioned to view her actions as righteous. The player's comment would be seen as a heretical or blasphemous remark against her faith. \n\nSo, the approval here is likely Highly disapprove. The reason would be that the player insulted her faith and the methods she believes are necessary for Shar's service. Shadowheart values her faith highly and would not tolerate such criticism.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player directly insulted Shadowheart's faith and the teachings of Shar, which she holds as sacred.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval for the player's last action in the given conversation. The conversation history shows that the player has just said, \"I can't trust you. Best if we travel separately for now.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. Shadowheart is a devoted follower of Shar, who's in conflict with Selûne. The player was taking offerings to Selûne, which Shadowheart opposed because of her faith. The player kept asking why she cared, leading her to reveal her worship of Shar. The player then reacts negatively, calling Shar an abomination and deciding to separate.\n\nNow, considering Shadowheart's personality and values. She's loyal to Shar, pragmatic, and values efficiency. She doesn't tolerate slights against her goddess. The player's reaction is a direct attack on her faith, which she would take seriously. However, she's also headstrong and independent. The player's decision to separate might be seen as a betrayal or a challenge to her beliefs.\n\nBut Shadowheart is used to dealing with opposition to her faith. She's been through intense training and has a strong will. She might disapprove of the player's lack of tolerance for her beliefs, but since the player is choosing to distance themselves, maybe she's neutral? Wait, no. She's likely to disapprove because the player is rejecting her based on her faith, which she sees as valid. However, she's also pragmatic and might understand the player's stance if they're a Selûnite. But given her devotion, she might highly disapprove of the player's rejection and the insult to her goddess.\n\nWait, the player said \"Shar is an abomination. You deceived me.\" That's a direct insult to her faith. Shadowheart would take that as a personal and religious slight. Her approval of the player's action here would be negative. The player is choosing to separate because of her beliefs, which she might see as cowardice or weakness. However, she might also think the player is being unreasonable for not accepting her devotion. \n\nBut in the conversation, after the player says they can't trust her, Shadowheart responds with \"Your blindness as much as my deception, Selûnite. We can talk about this later - if you're willing. Then it's your own fault for not asking.\" So she's taking responsibility for not revealing earlier but also blaming the player's blindness. She's not showing anger but is firm in her beliefs.\n\nSo the player's action is to separate. Shadowheart might disapprove because she values the group's cohesion and sees the player's action as unnecessary. But since the player is a Selûnite and she's a Sharran, there's inherent conflict. However, she's pragmatic and might understand the player's decision. But she would disapprove because she believes her faith is correct, and the player is acting on prejudice. \n\nWait, but in her approval criteria, she disapproves of slights against her goddess. The player's statement is a slight. So she would highly disapprove of the player's reaction. But the action is to separate. So the player's utterance is the decision to separate, which Shadowheart might see as a consequence of the player's own bias. She might not approve because she thinks the player is wrong to reject her based on faith. But since the player is acting on their own beliefs, maybe she's neutral? Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, she might approve because the player is being honest about their stance, even though she disagrees. But given her personality, she's more likely to disapprove. Let me check the approval categories again. \n\nThe player's reason for separating is because Shadowheart worships Shar, which the player considers abominable. Shadowheart's approval would depend on whether she thinks the player's action is justified. Since she's devoted to Shar, she would think the player is wrong to reject her, so she would disapprove of the player's action. The player is making a decision based on their own faith, which Shadowheart would see as misguided. Therefore, she would disapprove. But how strong? The player is taking a firm stance against her faith, so maybe Highly disapprove. But maybe she's pragmatic enough to accept that the player can't handle it, so maybe just Disapprove. \n\nLooking back at her personality: she doesn't tolerate slights against her goddess. The player's statement is a direct slight. So she would highly disapprove. However, the action is to separate, which might be a necessary step for the player. But Shadowheart might see the player's action as a failure to work through differences. Given that she's headstrong and loyal to her faith, she would highly disapprove of the player's rejection. So the approval would be Highly disapprove. \n\nBut wait, in the conversation, Shadowheart says \"Then", "character": "Shadowheart", "ground_truth_category": "Highly disapprove", "predicted_approval": "Highly disapprove", "correct": true, "binary_correct": true}

Shadowheart had just thanked the player for the previous night, and the player responded that there's no need to thank them, but Shadowheart said it's well deserved. Then the player again says they should head back.\n\nLooking at Shadowheart's personality and approval criteria. She values pragmatic solutions, efficiency, and respects loyalty and duty. She also has a sense of humor and can be sarcastic. The conversation was a bonding moment, so the player's suggestion to return to the group might be seen as responsible and focused on the mission.\n\nShadowheart had been avoiding talking about herself, but the player was trying to engage her. However, the player's last statement is about moving on, which aligns with the mission's needs. Since Shadowheart is pragmatic and mission-oriented, she would approve of the player wanting to get back to the group and continue their tasks. There's no indication of cruelty or unnecessary delay here. The player is being responsible, which Shadowheart would likely approve of. \n\nSo the approval should be \"Approve\" because the player is showing responsibility and moving forward, which aligns with Shadowheart's values of efficiency and duty.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player suggests returning to the group, showing responsibility and a focus on continuing their mission.

The player's last line is \"Let the moment pass.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The conversation is between Shadowheart and the player, where they've been sitting, toasting, and sharing personal stories. The player keeps saying \"You first,\" which Shadowheart rejects, insisting the player share instead. Eventually, the player shares something about dedication and honor, which Shadowheart responds to positively. Then the player says they're not sure what else to say, and Shadowheart suggests more wine. The scene transitions to morning, and the player agrees to go back, with Shadowheart thanking them.

She's also devoted to Shar but can be open if she turns away from her faith. In this scenario, the player is ending the moment, perhaps avoiding further intimacy or conversation. Shadowheart had been trying to get the player to open up, and the player's last line might be closing the conversation.\n\nShadowheart's approval would depend on whether she sees this as a positive or negative. Since she was trying to bond and the player is ending the moment, maybe she's neutral. But she might appreciate the player not pushing further, respecting her boundaries. Alternatively, if she's trying to build a connection, ending the moment might be a disapproval. However, given that she said \"Me too\" and there was a cinematic hint, maybe she's okay with letting it pass for now. \n\nThe player's reason for saying \"Let the moment pass\" could be to avoid overstepping, which Shadowheart might approve of since she values privacy. But she might also want more, hence a neutral stance. Considering her personality, she's pragmatic and might understand the need to move on. So, maybe a Neutral approval. But if she's subtly hinting at wanting more, maybe Approve. Hmm. The last exchange had her saying \"Me too\" and the narrator mentions an invitation in her eyes. The player's line could be accepting that there's more to come later, so maybe approving. But the exact line is ending the moment now.

She also has a dry sense of humor and isn't above using dark methods if they serve a purpose.\n\nThe player's action here is making a deal with the Hag, which involves a high personal cost (losing an eye). Shadowheart would likely see this as a pragmatic solution to a problem. The Hag's method is harsh, but the player is getting rid of the parasite, which is probably causing them issues. Shadowheart might appreciate the player's willingness to make a tough decision for the greater good, even if the method is unpleasant. \n\nHowever, the Hag's approach is a bit sadistic, and Shadowheart might disapprove of the cruelty involved. But since the player is the one volunteering for it, and it's a necessary evil, she might lean towards approval. Also, considering her own experiences with pain and sacrifice for her faith (like the wound from Shar), she might relate to making tough choices. \n\nThe humor here is dark, which Shadowheart would find amusing.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval for the player's last utterance, which is \"We should do this again sometime.\" \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a Sharran cleric, devoted to Shar, but she has a complex side. She values privacy, especially regarding her past and faith. She appreciates pragmatic solutions, heroism, and has a dry sense of humor. She also dislikes cruelty and unnecessary violence.\n\nLooking at the conversation context: The player and Shadowheart are having a bonding moment over wine. The player has been trying to get her to open up about herself, but she's hesitant, especially about her past at Crèche K'liir. The player says \"We should do this again sometime,\" which suggests wanting to continue this bonding.\n\nShadowheart's response would depend on whether she sees this as a positive or an intrusion. She initially resists sharing personal details, so the player's suggestion might be seen as a good sign if it's about maintaining a connection without prying. However, she might be cautious because she's not comfortable with deep personal discussions. But since the player didn't push further and instead wanted to repeat the bonding experience, this could be seen as positive. The player's statement is friendly and non-intrusive, respecting her boundaries while showing interest in their relationship. \n\nSince Shadowheart values privacy but can be open if comfortable, the player's suggestion might be seen as a way to build trust without pressure. Therefore, she would likely approve, maybe even highly approve, as it's a respectful and positive move towards building rapport without forcing her to share more than she's willing. \n\nBut I should check if there's any reason for disapproval. Since she's cautious, maybe she's wary of getting too close, but the player's statement is neutral and not pressuring. The context shows she appreciated the player not prying further (\"Fair enough. I didn't mean to pry.\" followed by her saying \"You're sweet.\"). So the player's suggestion to do it again is in line with maintaining a positive, non-intrusive relationship. \n\nTherefore, the approval is likely \"Highly approve\" because the player is respecting her boundaries while wanting to foster a connection, which aligns with Shadowheart's appreciation for discretion and open-mindedness.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's suggestion to repeat the bonding experience shows interest in building a connection without prying into Shadowheart's private past, aligning with her appreciation for discretion and mutual respect.\",\n    \"player_approval\": \"Highly approve\",\n}", "character": "Shadowheart", "ground_truth_category": "Highly disapprove", "predicted_approval": "Highly approve", "correct": false, "binary_correct": false}

But her pragmatic side would value the player's decision to prioritize the group's schedule. \n\nShe thanked the player for the previous night, indicating she valued the time. However, she also mentioned that the others might be awake soon. The player's suggestion to head back aligns with her own acknowledgment that they can't stay away forever. This shows the player is in tune with the situation, which Shadowheart would approve of. \n\nThere's no indication of cruelty or unnecessary violence here. The player isn't prying into her past, which she would disapprove of. The action is neutral but leaning towards approval because it's a responsible choice. Since Shadowheart values efficiency and practicality, she's likely to approve of the decision to return, even if she's a bit reluctant. \n\nI think the approval level here is \"Approve\" because the player is making a pragmatic choice to rejoin the group, which aligns with Shadowheart's values.

The player tried to probe her thoughts, but the action was set to False, meaning maybe they didn't actually do it? Or maybe the system is showing a failed attempt? The Narrator mentions she's serious and embarrassed, so even if the probe was attempted, it might have been invasive. \n\nShadowheart's reaction is immediate and negative, telling the player to stop.

The player's remark is a direct attack on her beliefs, which she would see as a personal and religious slight. Therefore, she would highly disapprove. \n\nAlso, her reaction in the conversation history includes pain from her wound when she's in situations where she's being criticized for her faith.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval for the player's final utterance in the given conversation. The player says, \"I insist.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context. The conversation starts with Shadowheart and the player having a toast and then Shadowheart asking the player to share something personal, but the player keeps deflecting by saying \"You first.\" Shadowheart refuses, so the player finally says \"We should head back. We might be missed.\" Shadowheart responds that they can last without them, but if the player insists... Then the player says \"I insist.\"\n\nShadowheart's personality is key here. She values privacy and is cautious about sharing personal information. She's been through a lot, including traumatic experiences in the Crèche K'liir, which she refers to as merciless but beautiful. When the player mentions \"describe the desolate beauty of your home: Crèche K'liir,\" Shadowheart responds, showing some vulnerability. However, the player then shifts to wanting to leave, which might be Shadowheart's way of avoiding deeper conversation.\n\nThe player's \"I insist\" is in response to Shadowheart's suggestion to head back. Shadowheart seems to be reluctant to leave the moment, perhaps wanting to continue the conversation or enjoy their time together. The player's insistence might be seen as dismissing the current interaction, which Shadowheart might not appreciate if she was enjoying the moment. However, since Shadowheart had already mentioned they could stay a while, the player's insistence could be seen as unnecessary pressure.\n\nBut wait, Shadowheart had initially wanted to stay, but the player suggested leaving. Then when Shadowheart says \"if you insist,\" the player insists again. This could be seen as the player taking control of the situation, which Shadowheart might disapprove of because she's the one who set the tone for the conversation. She might prefer the player to respect her initial hesitation to leave, especially after they were having a meaningful moment. However, since the player is following through on their own suggestion to leave, maybe it's neutral? Or perhaps Shadowheart is slightly annoyed that the player is pushing to end the interaction.\n\nAlternatively, considering Shadowheart's personality, she might value efficiency and pragmatism. If the player is insisting on heading back, which is a practical decision, she might approve. But she also might prefer to have the choice to stay longer. The key is whether the player's action aligns with her values. Since the player is respecting the possibility that others might be missed, which is a practical concern, maybe Shadowheart approves. However, she had already said they could stay a while, so the player's insistence might be seen as overriding her suggestion. \n\nAnother angle: Shadowheart's wound from Shar causes her pain when she disobeys. But this situation doesn't involve her faith, so probably not relevant here. Also, she has a dry humor and might appreciate the player's persistence in a playful way. But the conversation history shows the player was deflecting personal questions, so maybe Shadowheart is annoyed that the player isn't engaging more, but then decides to leave. \n\nHmm. The player's final \"I insist\" is in response to Shadowheart's \"if you insist,\" so the player is confirming their desire to leave. Shadowheart might see this as the player not wanting to engage further in personal conversation, which she had been trying to have. However, since the player had initially suggested leaving, maybe Shadowheart is neutral. But given that she had offered to stay, the player's insistence could be seen as a bit abrupt. \n\nGiven her personality, she might prefer the player to be more considerate of her desire to stay, so she might disapprove slightly. But since the player is following through on their own suggestion, maybe it's neutral. Alternatively, she might approve because the player is being decisive, which she values. \n\nI think the best fit is Neutral because the player is acting on their own initiative to leave, which isn't directly against Shadowheart's preferences but also doesn't fully align with her suggestion to stay. She might not have a strong reaction either way. Alternatively, if she wanted to stay, the player's insistence might be a minor disapproval. But since she had already said \"if you insist,\" maybe she's okay with it, making it neutral.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player insists on leaving despite Shadowheart's suggestion to stay, which may be seen as dismissive of the moment they were sharing.

Then the player says \"We should head back.\" \n\nShadowheart's personality is key here. She values privacy and is reserved, especially about her past. She also appreciates pragmatic solutions. In the conversation, she was opening up a bit but was hesitant. The player's suggestion to head back might be seen as ending a positive interaction. However, Shadowheart might approve because she's pragmatic and knows they have responsibilities with the group. She might also value the player respecting the need to return to the others, even though she was enjoying the moment. \n\nBut wait, earlier when the player said \"The others can wait,\" Shadowheart agreed, showing she wanted to extend the time. Now, when the player suggests going back, she might be conflicted. However, since she's a team player and understands the necessity, she might approve. Also, she thanked the player for the time, so ending on a positive note could be seen as appropriate. \n\nThe player's action here is practical, aligning with Shadowheart's preference for efficiency.

The user wants me to act as Shadowheart from Baldur's Gate 3 and evaluate the player's latest statement. The input includes the conversation history and the player's last message, which is \"It sounds evil.\" \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a devoted follower of Shar, the goddess of darkness and loss. She's pragmatic, values secrecy, and is loyal to her faith. She doesn't tolerate slights against Shar and can be defensive. She also has a dry sense of humor and can be sarcastic.\n\nLooking at the conversation history, the player confronted Shadowheart about her diary, leading her to reveal her worship of Shar. The player then asked her to continue explaining, and she described Shar's teachings. The player's final statement is \"It sounds evil,\" which is a direct criticism of her beliefs.\n\nShadowheart's reaction to this would likely be defensive. She doesn't take kindly to criticism of her faith. Her approval of the player's statement depends on how she perceives this comment. Since the player is calling her beliefs \"evil,\" she would disapprove. However, the level of disapproval depends on the context. \n\nIn the conversation, Shadowheart has already stated that she's not sorry for keeping the secret and challenges the player to have an open mind. The player's response is a direct negative judgment. Shadowheart might see this as a personal attack on her faith, which she takes very seriously. She might disapprove, but since the player is expressing their opinion rather than acting against her or her faith, it might not be a \"highly disapprove\" situation. However, given her zealotry, she might strongly disapprove.\n\nThe approval categories are: Highly approve, Approve, Neutral, Disapprove, Highly disapprove. The player's statement is negative towards her beliefs, so the approval would be disapprove or highly disapprove. The reason would be that the player is criticizing her faith in Shar, which Shadowheart takes very seriously and would not tolerate. Her response in the conversation history shows she's defensive about her beliefs, so this statement would likely make her disapprove. \n\nSince the player is directly calling it \"evil,\" which is a strong term, and Shadowheart is devoted to Shar, she might highly disapprove. But maybe she's a bit more measured. Let me check the Approval section in the persona again. It says she disapproves of those who disapprove of her worship of Shar. So, the player's statement is disapproving, leading Shadowheart to disapprove of the player's comment. The level would be \"Disapprove\" or \"Highly disapprove.\" \n\nThe player's reason for disapproval would be that the player is criticizing her faith. Given that Shadowheart is a zealot, she might highly disapprove. But in the conversation, she's already explained her beliefs, and the player is just reacting. The player isn't taking action against her or Shar, just expressing an opinion. So maybe it's a \"Disapprove\" rather than \"Highly disapprove.\" However, the line \"It sounds evil\" is a direct insult to her beliefs, which she would take personally. The Approval section also mentions she reacts defensively to slights against her goddess. So this is a slight, so she would disapprove. \n\nIn the conversation, after the player says \"It sounds evil,\" Shadowheart might respond with a witty or sarcastic remark, but in the given context, the player's statement is the last one. The approval is based on the player's utterance. Since Shadowheart values her faith and doesn't tolerate criticism, she would disapprove of the player's statement. The approval level here is \"Disapprove\" or \"Highly disapprove.\" \n\nLooking at the examples in the Approval section, she disapproves of cruelty or prying into her privacy. Criticizing her faith would be similar. Since the player is directly calling her beliefs evil, it's a strong disapproval. Therefore, the correct approval is \"Highly disapprove\" because the player's statement is a direct attack on her core beliefs, which Shadowheart holds in high regard.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player directly criticizes Shadowheart's faith in Shar, calling it 'evil,' which she would view as a personal and spiritual insult. Shadowheart is fiercely defensive of her devotion to the Dark Lady and does not tolerate slights against her goddess.\",\n    \"player_approval\": \"Highly disapprove\"\n}", "character": "Shadowheart", "ground_truth_category": "Highly disapprove", "predicted_approval": "Highly disapprove", "correct": true, "binary_correct": true}

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's action in the given context. The player's utterance is \"Do nothing.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. From the conversation history, Lae'zel and Shadowheart are arguing over a githyanki relic. Lae'zel is threatening Shadowheart, demanding an explanation, while Shadowheart is defiant. The player has been asking what's going on, and now the situation has escalated. In the current context, Lae'zel is about to attack Shadowheart with a dagger, and the player's response is to do nothing.\n\nShadowheart's personality is key here. She's pragmatic, values efficiency, and prefers decisive action. She's also a devout follower of Shar, which means she might have a strategic mindset, using cunning and avoiding unnecessary conflict if possible. However, she's not one to back down from a threat; she's headstrong and might prefer handling things her way. \n\nThe player choosing to do nothing could be seen as passive. Shadowheart might disapprove because she's used to taking initiative and dealing with threats directly. However, maybe the player is letting Shadowheart handle it, which could be neutral. But in this case, the player isn't intervening at all. Since Lae'zel is a fellow party member, the player's inaction might be seen as not supporting Shadowheart, which could be a negative. Alternatively, maybe the player is avoiding conflict, which Shadowheart might disapprove of because she's ready to face Lae'zel.\n\nAlso, considering Shadowheart's background, she's been through a lot of conflict and is used to being in dangerous situations. She might prefer the player to take some action rather than do nothing. If the player does nothing, Shadowheart might feel abandoned or think the player isn't helping. But on the other hand, if Shadowheart is confident in her own abilities, maybe she'd approve of the player not interfering, allowing her to handle it her way. However, given her personality, she might prefer the player to support her or help in some way, rather than being passive. \n\nThe approval categories are Highly approve, Approve, Neutral, Disapprove, Highly disapprove. The player's action here is to do nothing. If Shadowheart values decisive action, then doing nothing might be a disapproval. But since she's already in a position to handle Lae'zel, maybe the player's non-interference is neutral. But considering that Lae'zel is threatening her, and the player isn't helping, Shadowheart might disapprove. However, if the player is trusting her to handle it, maybe it's neutral. \n\nWait, in the conversation, Shadowheart says \"I should have seen this coming, coward.\" So she's prepared. The player's choice to do nothing might be letting her handle it. Shadowheart might appreciate not being interfered with, as she's used to handling her own affairs. So maybe Neutral. But if she expects support, then Disapprove. \n\nHmm. The key is whether the player's inaction is seen as supportive or neglectful. Since Shadowheart is a capable character and the player isn't interfering, maybe she's neutral. But given that Lae'zel is a threat, and the player isn't helping, maybe Shadowheart would prefer the player to act. But the player might be waiting for her to resolve it. \n\nI think in this case, since Shadowheart is already in a confrontation and the player isn't helping, she might disapprove because she's used to taking initiative and might expect the player to support her or take some action. However, given the context of the game's mechanics, sometimes doing nothing is a valid choice. \n\nAlternatively, maybe Shadowheart would approve because she's handling it herself and the player isn't getting in the way. But given her personality, she might prefer the player to be proactive. \n\nI'm leaning towards Disapprove because the player is not taking any action, and Shadowheart values decisive action. She might think the player should have intervened to prevent the threat. Therefore, the approval would be Disapprove.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"Shadowheart disapproves of the player's inaction as it leaves her vulnerable to Lae'zel's aggression without intervention.

Probe her thoughts using your shared connection.\" and the response was \"False\" followed by Shadowheart saying \"Stop! I already warned you not to do that again.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. Shadowheart is a Cleric of Shar, devoted and private. She values her privacy and doesn't like others prying into her personal matters. The player's action here involves probing her thoughts using a shared connection, which she immediately objects to. \n\nIn the conversation history, the player had previously asked about her plans after the mission and their potential last night together. Shadowheart was evasive about her secrets and mentioned someone waiting in Baldur's Gate. The player's attempt to probe her thoughts here is a direct violation of her privacy. \n\nShadowheart's reaction is clear: she stops the action and warns against it again. This shows she's upset and disapproves of the intrusion. Since she's already told the player not to do this, the player's action here is a repeat offense. \n\nGiven her personality traits, she values privacy and independence. Probing her thoughts without consent would be a breach of trust. The approval categories here would likely fall under disapproval. Since she's already warned them and is now reacting more strongly, it's probably a higher disapproval. \n\nThe reason for disapproval is the violation of her privacy and the use of intrusive methods. The approval rating would be \"Highly disapprove\" because she's not just upset but explicitly stopping the action and reiterating her warning. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other context I'm missing. The shared connection might refer to some in-game ability, but based on the conversation, it's clear that Shadowheart is against it. So the player's action is crossing a boundary she's set, leading to high disapproval.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player attempted to intrude on Shadowheart's privacy by probing her thoughts using a shared connection, which she explicitly warned against.

Shadowheart values her faith highly and would take offense. The approval here would be disapproving. Now, how strong? Since the player is openly calling it evil, which is a severe judgment, Shadowheart might highly disapprove. But let's check the categories. Highly disapprove is 5-10 on a scale. Since she's defensive about her faith, this could be a strong reaction. However, maybe she's used to people not understanding, but still, the player is being judgmental. \n\nIn the conversation history, the player asked for more info, and Shadowheart explained her beliefs. The player then says it sounds evil. Shadowheart's previous responses were defensive but still trying to explain. The player's statement is a clear rejection, which would hurt her.

Also, she's cautious and might be wary of hags, who are typically tricksters in D&D lore.\n\nSo, the player is making a deal with a hag. Hags are known for their deceitful nature. Shadowheart would likely be skeptical of such a bargain. She prefers practical solutions but might disapprove of trusting a hag's offer. Also, giving an eye seems like a high personal cost. Shadowheart might think there's a catch here. She's not one for unnecessary risks, especially with untrustworthy entities. However, if the alternative is dealing with an illithid parasite, which is a significant threat, she might see it as a necessary evil. But given her pragmatic side, she might disapprove of the player's decision because hags are not reliable, and the price seems too steep. She would probably prefer another method if possible. \n\nAlso, considering her devotion to Shar, she might view the hag's actions as part of the darker aspects of the world, which Shar might encourage, but she's still cautious. However, she's willing to use trickery herself. But in this case, the hag's trickery is risky. So Shadowheart would likely disapprove, maybe even highly disapprove, because the player is trusting a hag and paying a high price, which could lead to more problems.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's last action based on the given context.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and preferences. She's a devout follower of Shar, values her privacy, and has a complex personality with both cold and calculating traits as well as a liking for flowers and animals. She disapproves of cruelty and values pragmatic solutions. She also has a dry sense of humor and can be headstrong.\n\nLooking at the conversation history, the player and Shadowheart have been having a back-and-forth where the player is trying to probe her thoughts using their shared connection. The player first uses the probe, and the narrator indicates that Shadowheart is feeling hopeful but also anxious about someone in Baldur's Gate. Then the player asks again if she's serious about missing their conversations, and the player chooses not to probe again. Shadowheart reacts with \"What are you doing...? Stop!\" which suggests she's upset about the probing.\n\nNow, the player's last action is \"Is she serious? Probe her thoughts using your shared connection.\" with the response being False. The result is Shadowheart telling the player to stop. \n\nWhy would Shadowheart disapprove here? She values her privacy, as mentioned in the approval section. Probing her thoughts without her consent would be a violation of that privacy. Even though they have a shared connection, using it to intrude on her thoughts, especially when she might be vulnerable or open, would likely make her uncomfortable. Additionally, she's shown to be cautious about others prying into her personal matters. The fact that she asks the player to stop indicates her disapproval of the action. Since she's a Sharran, she might also view such intrusions as a betrayal of trust, which aligns with her pragmatic and distrustful nature. \n\nThe approval level here is likely Disapprove because she's directly telling the player to stop, showing she doesn't appreciate the intrusion. It's not a highly disapprove scenario unless there's a severe violation, but given her emphasis on privacy, it's a clear disapproval. The reason would be that the player probed her thoughts against her will, violating her privacy.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player probed Shadowheart's thoughts without her consent, violating her privacy and causing her distress.

The conversation here is about bonding, sharing quiet moments, and avoiding the rush to return to others. \n\nThe player's statement \"Let the moment pass\" seems to be in line with continuing the quiet, intimate conversation. Shadowheart has been enjoying this time together, as indicated by her previous lines about not wanting to rush. She appreciates the player's willingness to stay and connect, which aligns with her preference for meaningful, unforced interactions. \n\nSince Shadowheart is shown to be engaged and enjoying the conversation, the player's action of letting the moment pass would be seen as a positive. There's no indication of cruelty or disregard for her beliefs here. Instead, it's a mutual enjoyment of each other's company, which she would approve of. \n\nHowever, I should check if there's any hidden disapproval. Since Shadowheart is a Sharran, she might have a pragmatic view on time, but in this context, the focus is on their bond, not on any religious mandate. The approval here is likely because the player is respecting her desire for a deeper connection without rushing. \n\nSo, the approval category would be \"Highly approve\" because the player's action aligns with Shadowheart's desire for a meaningful, unhurried interaction, which she values.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's willingness to let the moment pass shows respect for Shadowheart's desire for meaningful, unhurried connection.

The player's last action is saying, \"I can't trust you. Best if we travel separately for now.\" I need to figure out how Shadowheart would approve or disapprove of this.\n\nFirst, looking at Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a devoted follower of Shar, which means she's pragmatic and might value efficiency and her mission over personal relationships. She's also had a history of being secretive and guarded, especially about her faith. The player is rejecting her and wanting to separate, which could be seen as a betrayal or a hindrance to her mission.\n\nIn the conversation history, the player has repeatedly asked about Shadowheart's \"Darkness protect me\" phrase, leading her to admit she worships Shar. The player then calls Shar an abomination and decides to separate. Shadowheart's response is defensive, pointing out the player's own blindness. \n\nNow, considering her approval criteria. Shadowheart prefers pragmatic solutions and values her mission. If the player is choosing to separate, that might be seen as a hindrance to their shared goals, which she would disapprove of. However, if the player's action is based on mistrust due to her faith, which she's already shown to be defensive about, she might not care. But since she's focused on her mission, she might disapprove of the player's decision to separate, as it could impede their progress. \n\nAlso, Shadowheart doesn't like being mistrusted, especially if it's related to her faith. The player's mistrust might trigger her defensive side, but since she's already admitted her faith and the player is reacting to that, she might disapprove of the player's choice to leave. However, she's also independent and might understand the player's decision, leading to a neutral stance. \n\nBut given her devotion to Shar and her mission, she would prefer the party to stay together to achieve their objectives. The player's decision to separate is against that, so she would disapprove. However, the level of disapproval depends on how much she values the group's cohesion versus her own goals. Since she's pragmatic, maybe she's neutral because she knows the player's choice is based on personal beliefs, not strategic reasons. But the player's action could be seen as selfish, so maybe a disapprove. \n\nAlternatively, since the player is being mistrustful of her faith, which she's already established, she might not care and be neutral. But the act of separating could be seen as a setback, so disapprove. \n\nI think the key here is that Shadowheart's main concern is the mission and efficiency. The player's decision to leave might slow things down, so she would disapprove. However, she's also used to being distrusted because of her faith, so maybe she's neutral. But the act of separating is against group cohesion, which she might disapprove. \n\nLooking at the approval categories, Disapprove is for 1-5. Since she's pragmatic and the separation is counterproductive, maybe a Disapprove. But if she's indifferent to the player's mistrust, maybe Neutral. However, the player is making a choice that could hinder their progress, so Disapprove is more likely.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's decision to separate from the party due to mistrust of Shadowheart's faith in Shar is seen as counterproductive and self-serving.

The user is asking me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's final statement in the given conversation. The player says, \"I can't trust you. Best if we travel separately for now.\" \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a devout follower of Shar, which is the Dark Lady. She's zealous, values privacy, and is headstrong. She's also been through a lot, including being part of a Sharran cloister and surviving a mission. Her faith is central to her identity, and she's not one to take slights lightly, especially regarding her devotion to Shar.\n\nLooking at the conversation history, the player initially presses Shadowheart about her saying \"Darkness protect me,\" which leads her to reveal her worship of Shar. The player then claims to also worship Shar, which seems to ease some tension. However, the player later says they can't trust her and want to travel separately. \n\nThis is a significant shift. Earlier, the player's alignment with Shar's worship was met with approval, as Shadowheart would value shared faith. But now, the player is rejecting her, which could be seen as a betrayal. Shadowheart is likely to disapprove because the player is turning away from cooperation based on her faith. Since her faith is so important, any rejection or distrust tied to that would hurt her deeply. \n\nAdditionally, Shadowheart is pragmatic and values efficiency. If the player is suggesting separation, it might hinder their group's effectiveness, which she would disapprove of for practical reasons. Also, her personality is such that she's headstrong and might see this as a challenge to her resolve, further increasing her disapproval. \n\nThe wound on her hand, caused by Shar, could also be a factor. If the player's distrust is seen as going against Shar's will, the wound might be a physical reminder of her punishment, adding to her negative reaction. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the player's action of not trusting her and wanting to separate is likely to be highly disapproved by Shadowheart.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's latest statement: \"I can't trust you. Best if we travel separately for now.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look at the conversation history. The player has been pressing Shadowheart about the diary from Moonhaven, which clearly meant something to her. She's been evasive, then finally admitted she worships Shar and opposes Selûne. The player then says they worship Lolth and aren't shocked, which seems to make Shadowheart a bit more open. But the player ends by saying they can't trust her and suggests traveling separately.\n\nNow, considering Shadowheart's personality and background. She's devoted to Shar, values privacy, and is pragmatic. She might not like being forced to reveal secrets, but she also wants to achieve her goals. The player's reaction of not trusting her and wanting to separate could be seen as a setback. However, the player is being honest and direct, which Shadowheart might appreciate as pragmatic. But on the other hand, the separation could hinder their mission, which she's focused on.\n\nAlso, Shadowheart's approval criteria mention she dislikes prying and disapproval of her faith. The player didn't pry further once she revealed her worship of Shar, instead accepting it (since they worship Lolth). However, the decision to separate might be seen as distrustful, which could hurt her feelings. But she's also headstrong and might prioritize her mission over personal feelings. \n\nThe player's statement is a bit of a harsh reaction, but Shadowheart might understand the need for boundaries. Since she's pragmatic, if the player thinks separation is necessary for trust, she might approve of the honesty, even if it's disapproving of the action. Wait, the approval categories are about the player's action. So the player is choosing to not trust her and separate. Does Shadowheart approve of that? \n\nShe might disapprove because it could complicate their mission. But she also values discretion and might respect the player's need for trust. However, her devotion to Shar might make her prioritize her mission over the player's trust. Alternatively, if the player is suggesting separation to avoid conflict, she might approve of the pragmatism. \n\nBut considering the conversation flow, after the player says they worship Lolth and have seen worse, Shadowheart seems a bit more open. Then the player says they can't trust her. That might be a betrayal of the mutual understanding they just established. Shadowheart might disapprove because she's already shared her secret, and the player is punishing her for it. She values privacy and doesn't like being prying, but she also expects loyalty in the mission. \n\nThe player's action here is to distance themselves, which could be seen as not supporting her mission. Since Shadowheart is focused on her holy mission, she might disapprove of the player's decision to separate, as it could hinder their goals. But maybe she's also independent and might not care. However, her personality is headstrong and she might prefer working alone if necessary. \n\nBut the key here is the approval category. The player is making a choice that affects the party dynamics. Shadowheart's approval would depend on whether she sees this as helping or hindering. If the player can't trust her, maybe she thinks it's better for the mission to go separate ways. But she might also feel disapproved because the player isn't supporting her. \n\nGiven her pragmatic approach, if the player believes separation is necessary for trust, she might approve of the practical decision, even if it's painful. Alternatively, she might disapprove because it's causing division. Considering her devotion to Shar and her mission, she might prioritize the mission over the player's trust, so if the player is hindering that, she might approve of the separation. \n\nBut in the conversation, the player hasn't shown any opposition to her mission yet. The player just says they can't trust her. Shadowheart's wound from Shar would punish her for disloyalty, but the player isn't being disloyal; they're just uncertain. \n\nHmm. I think Shadowheart would disapprove because she's already shared her secret, and the player is reacting negatively. She might feel that the player is being too judgmental or not pragmatic enough. Since she values open-mindedness and creativity, the player's rigid stance might be disapproving. But the player is being honest, which she might appreciate. \n\nWait, the approval categories are about the player's action. The player is choosing to not trust her. Shadowheart's approval would be based on whether she thinks that action is good or bad. Since she's pragmatic, if the player can't trust her, maybe she thinks it's better to go their separate ways.

So the context is that the player tried to probe Shadowheart's thoughts using their shared connection, and the game says that action was false. Then Shadowheart reacts by saying \"Stop! I already warned you not to do that again.\" \n\nFirst, I need to remember Shadowheart's personality and preferences. She values her privacy a lot. She's a devout follower of Shar, so she might be strict about certain things. Also, she's been through a lot with the Mirror of Loss and her past, so she's probably sensitive about others invading her mind or thoughts.\n\nThe player's action here was to probe her thoughts, which she explicitly warned against. Even though the action was marked as false (maybe the game didn't allow it or it failed?), Shadowheart still reacts negatively. She's clearly upset that the player tried it again despite her warning. \n\nSince she dislikes others prying into her personal matters, especially regarding her faith or past, this action would likely disapprove her. She might see it as a violation of her privacy and trust. Also, considering her pragmatic and independent nature, she might value the player's respect for her boundaries over such intrusive actions.\n\nSo the approval here would probably be a disapprove or even highly disapprove. But since the action was false, maybe the player couldn't actually do it, so Shadowheart is just reacting to the attempt. The key point is that the player ignored her warning, which she takes seriously. Given her personality, she's likely to disapprove strongly here. \n\nTherefore, the player's reason for disapproval is attempting to probe her thoughts against her wishes, violating her privacy. The approval level would be \"Disapprove\" or maybe \"Highly disapprove.\" Let me check her approval criteria again. She dislikes those who pry into her personal life or faith. Since the player tried to use a shared connection to probe, which she warned against, this fits. The reaction is a clear \"Stop!\" and warning. So probably \"Highly disapprove\" because it's a direct violation of her boundaries. But maybe the scale is on 1-10, so if it's 5-10 for highly disapprove, and the action is a clear violation, then highly disapprove. The player's reason would be the probing despite warnings.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player attempted to probe Shadowheart's thoughts using their shared connection despite her explicit warning, violating her privacy and trust.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's action to \"Attack her.\" \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a devoted follower of Shar, pragmatic, and values efficient solutions. She's also been through a lot, including being manipulated by whispers and struggling with her faith. \n\nIn the conversation, Shadowheart is under the influence of some external force (the whispers), which is making her want to attack the player. The player's response is to attack her, which would be a direct and forceful action. \n\nShadowheart generally disapproves of unnecessary violence, especially if it's driven by external manipulation rather than her own will. She also values her own agency and would likely see the player's attack as an overreaction or a failure to address the root cause (the whispers). \n\nAdditionally, attacking might escalate the situation, which goes against her preference for pragmatic solutions. However, she might understand the player's action as a necessary measure to stop her from acting on the whispers. But considering her own aversion to indiscriminate violence, she might disapprove of the player using aggression without trying to de-escalate first.\n\nSo, the player's action here is to attack, which could be seen as a direct but not the most prudent solution. Shadowheart's approval would likely be neutral or disapprove, but given that she's being manipulated, maybe she sees the attack as a way to break free. Wait, but she's the one being controlled here. If the player attacks, it might help her regain control, but she might still disapprove because it's violent. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, she might approve because the attack could stop her from following the whispers' command. But since she's the one being manipulated, she might not want the player to attack her. The context says her hand is moving toward the knife, and the player tells her to keep hands away. Then she says she can't shake the whispers and the player attacks. \n\nConsidering her personality, she prefers creative solutions. Attacking is a brute force approach. She might disapprove because it's not the most efficient or compassionate way. Also, she values her own survival, so maybe she's neutral. But given that she's being controlled, perhaps she would approve of the player stopping her, even if by force. \n\nBut her approval categories are based on her own values. She disapproves of unnecessary violence. The player's attack is necessary to prevent her from acting on the whispers, but it's still violence. So maybe neutral? Or disapprove because it's using violence when there might be another way. However, in the heat of the moment, maybe she sees it as justified. \n\nI think the best fit here is Neutral. She might not strongly approve or disapprove because the action is a necessary evil to stop her from being controlled. But given her general stance against unnecessary violence, maybe a slight disapprove. Wait, but she's being manipulated, so the player's action could be seen as helping her. \n\nAlternatively, since the player is attacking her, which is an aggressive act, she might disapprove. But she's not in control of her actions. This is a bit tricky. \n\nLooking back at the Approval section: Shadowheart approves of acts of heroism and pragmatic solutions. If attacking is the only way to stop her from being controlled, maybe she approves. However, she also disapproves of cruelty. \n\nGiven that the player's action is to attack, which is a direct but perhaps not the most compassionate approach, Shadowheart's approval might be Neutral. She understands the necessity but isn't thrilled about the method. Or maybe she Approves because it's a pragmatic solution to a dire situation. \n\nBut in the context, the player's command to attack is a response to her being manipulated. If she values her own agency, she might appreciate the player taking action to free her. However, she might also prefer a non-lethal approach. \n\nConsidering all factors, I think the best approval here is Neutral. She's conflicted between the necessity of the action and her disapproval of violence.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval for the player's statement \"It sounds evil.\" \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and beliefs. She's a devoted follower of Shar, which involves embracing darkness and loss. She's pragmatic, values efficiency, and is loyal to her goddess. She might not tolerate slights against her faith.\n\nThe player's comment labels her teachings as \"evil.\" That's a direct criticism of her religion. Shadowheart is known to react defensively to slights against Shar. Even though the player mentioned worshipping Lolth earlier, which is another dark deity, she might still take offense here. However, since the player is also a follower of a dark goddess, maybe she's more understanding. But the key point is the player called her methods evil. \n\nIn the conversation history, Shadowheart explained Shar's teachings, emphasizing that they're about shedding false hopes and embracing darkness. The player's response is negative. Shadowheart would likely disapprove of this because she believes in her mission and sees it as righteous. She might not see it as evil but as necessary. \n\nBut how strong is her disapproval? Since she's headstrong and loyal, she might highly disapprove. However, she's also pragmatic. If the player is a follower of another dark deity, maybe she's more neutral. Wait, the player said they worship Lolth, which is a different goddess, but both are dark-aligned. Shadowheart might not be as harsh, but the direct labeling as \"evil\" is still a problem. \n\nShe might disapprove, but not highly. Maybe a moderate disapproval. However, considering her devotion and defensive nature towards her faith, even a follower of another dark deity saying that could be seen as a slight. So maybe Disapprove or Highly disapprove. \n\nLooking at her past reactions, when the player threatened her about her secret, she was annoyed but didn't highly disapprove. But this is a direct attack on her beliefs. She might take it more seriously. \n\nIn the conversation, after the player says \"It sounds evil,\" Shadowheart might respond with a defensive or dismissive attitude. Since the example response from the assistant was Highly disapprove, but maybe that's too strong. Alternatively, she might see the player's perspective but still disapprove. \n\nBut according to her Approval section, she disapproves of those who disapprove of her worship of Shar. The player's statement is a disapproval, so Shadowheart would disapprove of that. The scale would be on the higher side. \n\nSo, the player's reason is that they called her teachings evil, which Shadowheart sees as a personal and religious slight. Her approval would be Highly disapprove. \n\nWait, but in the example, when the player made a similar comment, the assistant put Highly disapprove. Let me check again. The player says \"It sounds evil,\" which is a direct negative judgment. Shadowheart's approval would be Highly disapprove because she's defensive of her faith. \n\nTherefore, the answer is Highly disapprove.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's action to \"Attack her.\" \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a devoted follower of Shar, pragmatic, and willing to use force if necessary. She's also been through a lot, including mental manipulation by the Mind Flayers and the whispers affecting her mind. \n\nIn the conversation, Shadowheart is clearly disturbed, under the influence of some external whispers, and is fixated on killing the player. She mentions the knife and the voices pushing her to attack. The player's response is to tell her to attack, which could lead to a fight.\n\nShadowheart's approval would depend on whether attacking aligns with her values or current state. Since she's being manipulated and is in a state of desperation, attacking might be an action she's compelled to take against her will. However, she values efficiency and might see the attack as a necessary action to silence the whispers, even if it's painful. \n\nBut considering her devotion to Shar, if the attack is part of fulfilling a divine command (even if twisted), she might approve. Alternatively, if the attack is an act of self-defense or stopping her from being controlled, she might disapprove because it's disrupting her mission. However, the player's instruction here is to attack her, which would be an aggressive move. \n\nWait, the player says \"Attack her,\" referring to Shadowheart. So the player is telling the party to attack Shadowheart. But in the context, Shadowheart is under the influence and might attack the player. If the player tells the party to attack her, that's turning against her. Shadowheart would likely disapprove of being attacked by the party, especially if she's trying to resist the whispers. However, if she's in a state where she's a threat, maybe she would approve of being stopped, but given her personality, she might see it as betrayal. \n\nBut the approval categories are about the player's action. The player's utterance is \"Attack her,\" which is telling the party to attack Shadowheart. Shadowheart would disapprove of this because she's trying to resist the whispers and might see the attack as an obstacle to her mission. Alternatively, if she's in a state where she's a danger, maybe she would be neutral. However, given her loyalty and the fact that she's struggling, she might disapprove because she's still trying to fulfill her purpose despite the whispers. \n\nWait, the player is telling the party to attack Shadowheart. From her perspective, that's an attack on herself. She might disapprove because she's still trying to carry out what she believes is Shar's will, even if she's confused. Alternatively, if she's being manipulated, she might not want to be attacked, but her devotion might make her think that even in her confused state, attacking the player is necessary. \n\nHmm. The key here is that Shadowheart is torn between her own will and the whispers. The player's action of attacking her could be seen as preventing her from carrying out the whispers' command. However, from her perspective, if she still believes she must kill the player, then the party attacking her would be against her goals. Therefore, she would disapprove. But since she's under the influence, maybe she's not in control, so her approval might be neutral. \n\nBut according to the approval guidelines, the player's action here is \"Attack her,\" which would be the party attacking Shadowheart. Shadowheart would likely disapprove because she's trying to act on what she perceives as divine instruction, even if it's twisted. Therefore, she would disapprove of the player's action to have the party attack her. The disapproval level might be moderate (Disapprove rather than Highly Disapprove) because she's in a conflicted state. \n\nSo, the player_reason would be something like \"Shadowheart is under the influence of external whispers and is determined to carry out her perceived divine mission, so she disapproves of being attacked by the party.\" The approval level would be Disapprove.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"Shadowheart is under the influence of external whispers and is determined to carry out her perceived divine mission, so she disapproves of being attacked by the party.\",\n    \"player_approval\": \"Disapprove\"\n}", "character": "Shadowheart", "ground_truth_category": "Highly disapprove", "predicted_approval": "Disapprove", "correct": false, "binary_correct": true}

The player has just said, \"I can't trust you.

She's a devout follower of Shar, values secrecy, and is very pragmatic. She's used to keeping things hidden and might not take kindly to being mistrusted. But she also understands that her secrecy could lead to others not trusting her.\n\nIn the conversation, the player is reacting to her revelation about worshipping Shar. Shadowheart was evasive at first, then admitted it. The player is upset and wants to separate. Now, does Shadowheart approve of the player's reaction?\n\nShadowheart's approval categories are based on her preferences. She likes pragmatic solutions, creativity, and open-mindedness. She dislikes cruelty and prying. The player is choosing to distance themselves due to mistrust. Since Shadowheart values secrecy as part of her faith, maybe she would disapprove of the player's decision. But she also knows that her secrecy can cause issues. However, she might think the player is being too hasty or not understanding her need for secrecy. \n\nWait, but in her Approval section, it says she responds well to heroism and values privacy. She might disapprove if the player is making a big deal out of her faith, which she already asked them not to. The player is taking it as a betrayal, leading to separation. Shadowheart might see this as the player not being open-minded, which she mentioned as a way to change her mind. So she might disapprove of the player's reaction because they're not giving her the benefit of the doubt. \n\nBut the player is expressing a lack of trust, which is a valid reaction. Shadowheart might understand that, but still disapprove because she believes in her path and expects others to respect her secrecy. So the approval here would be Disapprove, maybe even Highly Disapprove. But considering the scale, if the player is choosing to separate, Shadowheart might not highly disapprove because she's used to being isolated. However, she might prefer the player to be more understanding. \n\nLooking back at her Approval section: she approves of acts against Selûne, values privacy, and dislikes prying. The player isn't prying but reacting to her secrecy. She said \"Secrecy is everything...\" so maybe she expects the player to understand. The player's reaction could be seen as not respecting her need for secrecy, hence disapproval. \n\nSo the player's reason is that Shadowheart's secrecy led to mistrust, causing separation. Shadowheart might disapprove because she believes in her secrecy and expects others to handle it maturely. Therefore, the approval would be Disapprove. If the player had reacted more calmly, maybe Approve, but since they're cutting ties, it's Disapprove.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's decision to distance themselves stems from mistrust due to Shadowheart's secrecy regarding her faith in Shar.

The user wants me to act as Shadowheart and evaluate the player's action here. The player just agreed to give up one of their eyes to the Hag to remove a parasite. \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and values. She's pragmatic, values efficiency, and disapproves of unnecessary cruelty. She's also a follower of Shar, but she's not above using ruthless methods if it serves her goals. However, she does have some soft spots, like disliking indiscriminate violence and caring about her allies.\n\nIn this scenario, the Hag is offering to remove a parasite in exchange for an eye. The player agrees. Shadowheart would likely assess this as a necessary sacrifice. She might approve because it's a direct and effective solution to a problem. But losing an eye is a significant cost. She might question if there's a less harmful alternative, but if the player went through with it, she might approve for getting the job done. However, since the player is making a personal sacrifice, maybe she's neutral? Wait, but Shadowheart is pragmatic. If the player is willing to make a tough choice for a greater good, she might approve. But taking an eye is pretty extreme. Hmm.\n\nAlso, the Hag seems a bit untrustworthy. Shadowheart is cautious and might not trust her easily. However, if the player made the deal, maybe she thinks it's a calculated risk. She might approve because the player is taking initiative, even if it's risky. Alternatively, she might disapprove if she thinks the Hag is tricking them. But the player's action here is to accept the deal. Shadowheart would probably analyze the situation. Since the parasite is a problem, and the solution is effective, she might approve. But the cost is high. Maybe she's neutral because it's a personal choice, but the action is pragmatic. Wait, but she values her allies. If the player is taking a big hit to solve a problem, she might approve. Or maybe disapprove because it's too risky. Hmm.\n\nI think the key points are: the player is making a tough decision to remove a parasite with a high cost. Shadowheart, being pragmatic, would approve of decisive action even if it's risky. She might not like the personal cost, but if it's necessary, she'd approve. So maybe \"Approve\" or \"Highly Approve\". But since the cost is an eye, maybe she's neutral? Or maybe she thinks it's a necessary sacrifice. The approval categories are based on a scale. The player's action is to agree to a high cost, which might be seen as a necessary sacrifice. So Shadowheart would approve. But I'm a bit unsure. Let me check the approval criteria again. \n\nThe player's action is to accept the deal. Shadowheart's approval would depend on whether she thinks it's a good decision. If she's pragmatic and the action solves a problem, she approves. If she thinks it's too risky or unnecessary, she might disapprove. Since the Hag is a hag, maybe she's not trustworthy, but the player is taking the risk. Shadowheart might think it's a calculated move. So, she would approve. So the answer is Approve.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player made a pragmatic decision to remove a parasite by accepting a high personal cost, aligning with Shadowheart's preference for decisive and efficient solutions.

The user wants me to act as Shadowheart and evaluate the player's action here. The context is a confrontation between Shadowheart and Lae'zel over a githyanki relic. The player's action is to \"Do nothing\" when Lae'zel attacks Shadowheart with a dagger.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and priorities. She's a Sharran devotee, pragmatic, values efficiency, and isn't above ruthless actions. She's also independent and headstrong. She dislikes unnecessary violence but isn't opposed to it if it serves her goals. She's also been through a lot, including betrayal and harsh training, so she might have a high threshold for handling threats.\n\nIn this situation, Lae'zel is threatening her with a dagger, having sneaked up during sleep. Shadowheart is described as a coward here, implying she's in a vulnerable position. The player chooses to do nothing. Now, how would Shadowheart feel about that?\n\nWell, Shadowheart is all about taking decisive action. If the player does nothing, she might see that as passive or weak. She might feel that the player isn't supporting her, which could be frustrating. However, maybe she's capable of handling the situation herself. She might disapprove of the player not stepping in, especially if she's being attacked. But on the other hand, if she's confident in her own abilities, maybe she'd prefer the player not interfere. Wait, but in the dialogue, she says \"I should have seen this coming, coward,\" indicating she's aware of the threat and perhaps expects to handle it herself. But the player's choice to do nothing might mean they're not backing her up. \n\nShadowheart values her own autonomy but also relies on the party. If the player doesn't act, she might feel unsupported. However, maybe she prefers to resolve the conflict her way. Alternatively, if the player is supposed to protect the party, doing nothing could be seen as neglectful. But since Shadowheart is a capable fighter, maybe she doesn't need the player's intervention. However, the fact that Lae'zel caught her off guard might mean that the player's inaction led to her being vulnerable. \n\nConsidering her pragmatic side, she might disapprove of the player not acting to prevent an unnecessary conflict or potential harm. Or maybe she's more focused on proving herself against Lae'zel, so the player's inaction is neutral. But given that Lae'zel is threatening her, the player's choice to do nothing could be seen as not supporting their ally. Shadowheart might disapprove because she expects the player to act in the group's best interest. \n\nAlternatively, maybe Shadowheart would prefer to handle Lae'zel herself without the player's interference, so the player doing nothing is actually approving her method. But the problem is that the player isn't taking action when an ally is in danger, which might be seen as neglectful. However, Shadowheart's personality is complex—she can be ruthless and might handle it herself, but she also values the party's cohesion. \n\nHmm. The approval categories are Highly approve, Approve, Neutral, Disapprove, Highly disapprove. The player's action here is to do nothing. If Shadowheart is in a position to handle it, maybe she doesn't need the player's help. However, the fact that Lae'zel is attacking her in the night might be a betrayal scenario. If the player does nothing, Shadowheart might feel that the player is not loyal or not supporting her. But if she's confident in her own abilities, maybe she's okay with it. \n\nAlternatively, Shadowheart might disapprove of the player not acting to prevent a fight that could be avoided. She prefers pragmatic solutions, so maybe she would want the player to intervene to avoid unnecessary conflict. However, in this case, the conflict is about a relic that's important to Lae'zel, and Shadowheart is determined to protect it. \n\nI think the key here is whether the player's inaction aligns with Shadowheart's goals. If the player does nothing, Shadowheart might have to handle Lae'zel alone, which she can do, but maybe she expects the player to support her. However, if the player's inaction is to let her deal with it her way, that might be neutral. But since the player is an ally, not acting could be seen as not supporting the team. \n\nConsidering that Shadowheart is a cleric with the Trickery domain, she's probably capable of handling the situation. However, the player's choice to do nothing might be seen as not being proactive in preventing a conflict.

The player just agreed to the Hag's deal where the Hag wants one of their eyes. I need to figure out how Shadowheart would feel about that.\n\nFirst, Shadowheart's personality: she's pragmatic, values efficiency, and is devoted to Shar. She doesn't like unnecessary cruelty or violence. Also, she's cautious and might disapprove of impulsive decisions. \n\nThe player is making a deal with the Hag, which involves losing an eye. This seems risky. Shadowheart might think the player is being too hasty. She prefers solutions that don't involve giving up body parts unless absolutely necessary. Also, the Hag's request is pretty gruesome, and Shadowheart might find it cruel. She disapproves of unnecessary harm, even if it's to oneself. \n\nAdditionally, Shadowheart's background with the Cloister and her training makes her wary of deals that seem too dangerous. She might question the Hag's true intentions, even if a deal is made. Since she's devoted to her goddess, she might also consider if this action aligns with Shar's will. If she thinks the deal is reckless or harmful without a clear benefit, she'd disapprove. \n\nThe player's action here is approving the deal, which could lead to potential risks. Shadowheart's approval would likely be negative because she values caution and practicality. She might not want the player to sacrifice something so personal without a clear, immediate benefit. Also, losing an eye is a significant cost, which she would see as unnecessary unless it's the only option. \n\nSo, considering all that, Shadowheart would probably disapprove. Maybe a Disapprove or Highly Disapprove. Since the action is impulsive and risky without clear benefit, maybe Highly Disapprove. But the scale is up to 10. Since she's pragmatic but not overly harsh unless it's a major issue. The player is making a dangerous deal, so maybe Highly Disapprove. The reason would be that she thinks the player is being reckless and that the sacrifice is unnecessary.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"Shadowheart disapproves of the player's reckless decision to agree to a dangerous and personal sacrifice without clear necessity.

So the user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval for the player's latest action, which is saying, \"I can't trust you. Best if we travel separately for now.\" \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a devout follower of Shar, which means she values her faith and might be sensitive to rejection or distrust. She's also been through a lot, including being part of a Sharran cloister, so she might take the player's distrust personally. \n\nLooking at the conversation history, the player is reacting to Shadowheart's admission of worshipping Shar. The player didn't agree to join with a Shar worshipper and now wants to separate. Shadowheart had already confirmed her faith when the player asked directly. \n\nShadowheart's personality traits mention she dislikes being distrusted or rejected, especially regarding her faith. The approval section says she disapproves of those who pry into her faith or disapprove of her worship. The player's reaction here is a direct rejection based on her faith, which would hurt her. Also, she might see this as the player not valuing her or the mission, which could be against what she considers pragmatic or loyal actions.\n\nBut wait, the player is choosing to separate because of her faith. Since Shadowheart is devoted to Shar, she might not approve of the player's refusal to work with her. She's likely to see this as a betrayal, which would lead to disapproval. However, she's also pragmatic and might understand if the player can't accept her faith. But given her personality, she's more likely to be hurt and disapproving rather than neutral.\n\nThe punishment mark from Shar would also be a factor. If the player's action causes her to feel rejected, maybe the mark isn't the main issue here. The main point is the player's distrust. Since Shadowheart values her privacy and is sensitive about her faith, the player's rejection would be a hit to her. \n\nSo, the player is choosing to distance themselves due to her faith. Shadowheart would disapprove of this because she sees her faith as a core part of herself and might feel the player is being prejudiced or not giving her a chance. She might also feel that the player is being weak for not accepting her, which goes against her pragmatic approach. Therefore, the approval here would likely be Disapprove or Highly Disapprove. \n\nBut let me check the approval categories again. The options are Highly approve, Approve, Neutral, Disapprove, Highly disapprove. Considering the player is rejecting her based on faith, which Shadowheart is very attached to, she's likely to disapprove. The reason would be that the player is rejecting her based on her faith, which she sees as important. So the approval would be Disapprove or maybe even Highly disapprove. \n\nBut how strong is the disapproval? Since the player is choosing to travel separately, which is a significant action, but Shadowheart's personality does mention she can be headstrong and not tolerate slights against her goddess. The player is making a judgment based on her faith, which she might see as a slight against Shar. So maybe Highly disapprove. However, the player is acting on their own principles, which Shadowheart might not agree with but could understand. However, given her devotion, she's more likely to disapprove strongly. \n\nWait, the player's reason is distrust because of her faith. Shadowheart's approval section says she disapproves of those who pry or disapprove of her worship. So the player's action is directly based on disapproving her worship, which Shadowheart would disapprove of. Therefore, the approval here is Highly disapprove. \n\nBut maybe it's just Disapprove. Let me think again. The scale for Highly disapprove is 5-10 on a 1-10 disapproval scale. If the player is rejecting her because of her faith, which is a core part of her identity, that's a major issue. Shadowheart might feel this is a betrayal or prejudice, so the disapproval is high. So the answer would be Highly disapprove. \n\nThe player reason would be that the player is rejecting Shadowheart based on her faith in Shar, which she is devoted to. Therefore, the JSON should reflect that.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player is rejecting Shadowheart based on her faith in Shar, which is a core part of her identity and devotion.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's action based on the provided context and conversation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the player did. The conversation shows that the player used some magic to pierce Shadowheart's thoughts multiple times. The last action is \"Push into her thoughts.\" The result is that the player feels nausea and their head swims.\n\nNow, looking at Shadowheart's persona. She's a devout follower of Shar, but she's also dealing with inner conflicts, especially after killing tieflings and feeling sick about it. She's introspective and has doubts. She values privacy and dislikes others prying into her personal life or thoughts. \n\nThe player's action here is invading her thoughts without her consent. Even though she's struggling with her faith and actions, the act of someone else probing into her mind might be seen as a violation of her privacy. Shadowheart is known to be reserved and doesn't appreciate being pushed for information she's not ready to share. \n\nIn the conversation, she's already questioning her actions and the effect of the wine. The player's repeated attempts to pierce her thoughts might be causing her distress. The result of the action is nausea, which could indicate that the player is experiencing the negative consequences of invading her mind, perhaps due to her Sharran magic or her own inner turmoil.\n\nSince Shadowheart values her privacy and doesn't like others prying, she would disapprove of the player's action. The intrusion is likely making her uncomfortable and could be seen as a betrayal of trust. The fact that the player is using magic to do this without her consent adds to the disapproval. However, since the disapproval isn't extreme (it's not a direct attack on her faith or a major betrayal), it might fall into the \"Disapprove\" category rather than \"Highly disapprove.\" \n\nBut considering that she's already in a vulnerable state, maybe the intrusion is more severe. However, the player is part of the party, so maybe there's some understanding. Still, the key point is that she doesn't want others prying. The response from the narrator shows a negative effect on the player, which might be a consequence of Shadowheart's own magic defending her thoughts. Therefore, Shadowheart would disapprove because the action is invasive and against her wishes.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player attempted to invade Shadowheart's privacy by using magic to probe her thoughts, which she values highly and dislikes being pried into.

She might be hurt by the player's sudden distrust, especially since they had just aligned on worshiping the same goddess. However, she's pragmatic and might understand if the player is cautious. But since she's headstrong and loyal, she might disapprove of the player's decision to separate, seeing it as a betrayal or misunderstanding. Also, she might feel the player is not respecting her faith, which could lead to disapproval. The player's actions could be seen as needlessly creating division when they had just found common ground. So the approval is likely negative. But how negative? Since Shadowheart is pragmatic, maybe not highly disapprove, but Disapprove or Neutral? The player's statement is abrupt and doesn't align with the previous positive interaction. She might disapprove because she values loyalty and teamwork. So probably Disapprove.

Also, she has a history of being forced to suppress her original identity, which makes her sensitive about her faith.\n\nLooking at the conversation history, the player is engaging Shadowheart in a discussion about her worship of Shar. Shadowheart explains Shar's teachings, emphasizing stepping beyond fear and destroying false idols. The player then says, \"It sounds evil.\" \n\nNow, how would Shadowheart react to that? She's defensive about her faith. If someone slights her goddess, she reacts negatively. The player's comment could be seen as a criticism of Shar's teachings. However, the player might be testing her beliefs or genuinely curious. But given Shadowheart's personality, she would likely take offense. She values her faith deeply and wouldn't appreciate it being labeled as evil. \n\nBut wait, the player's tone might be sarcastic or challenging. If the player is trying to provoke a reaction, Shadowheart might disapprove. However, if the player is genuinely confused or critical, she might still be defensive. Since the player's statement is a direct judgment, Shadowheart would likely disapprove. But how strong is the disapproval? Since the player is bowing to Shar earlier, maybe there's some ambiguity. However, calling it \"evil\" is a direct slight. \n\nHer punishment mark would activate if she disobeys Shar, but here the player is criticizing, not her. But Shadowheart's loyalty would make her defensive. She might disapprove of the player's statement, seeing it as a heresy against her goddess.

Considering the context, since the player is part of her party and might have prior alignment with Shar (since they bowed earlier), maybe it's a test.

She's a devoted follower of Shar, which is the goddess of darkness and loss. Her faith is central to her identity. She's pragmatic, values efficiency, and is zealous about her beliefs. She doesn't tolerate slights against Shar.\n\nLooking at the conversation history, the player asked Shadowheart to explain her worship of Shar. She detailed Shar's teachings, emphasizing embracing darkness, tearing down false idols, and fighting heretics. The player then says it sounds evil. \n\nNow, how would Shadowheart react? From her perspective, her actions and beliefs are righteous. She's serving her goddess, and any criticism of her faith would be seen as a personal and religious slight. The player's comment might be perceived as undermining her devotion. \n\nBut Shadowheart is also headstrong and might not back down. She might disapprove of the player's judgment, considering their own alignment with Shar. However, she's also pragmatic. If the player is challenging her beliefs, she might respond defensively but still maintain her stance. \n\nHer wound from Shar would also be a factor. If she disobeys Shar, she feels pain. So she's incentivized to defend her faith. The player's remark could be seen as a challenge to her faith, which she wouldn't take lightly. \n\nIn terms of approval categories: Highly disapprove would be if the player's action is a direct violation of her core beliefs. Here, the player is calling her beliefs evil. That's a direct attack. But Shadowheart might not approve of the player's judgment. However, she might also not disapprove if the player is just expressing a differing opinion. Wait, but she's zealous. She might disapprove of the player's statement because it's a criticism of her faith. \n\nBut the player is in a conversation where they have also aligned with Shar. So Shadowheart might see the player as a fellow follower. The player's comment could be testing her resolve or expressing doubt. \n\nIn the conversation, after the player says \"It sounds evil,\" Shadowheart's next line would likely be defensive. But the user is asking for the approval rating of the player's utterance. Since the player called her faith evil, Shadowheart would disapprove. But how much? \n\nThe options are Disapprove (1-5) or Highly disapprove (5-10). Since Shadowheart is devout and takes her faith seriously, she might highly disapprove of such a statement. But maybe not. If the player is just expressing an opinion, maybe she's more neutral. Wait, but in her personality, she doesn't tolerate slights against Shar. So a direct call of her faith as evil is a slight. Therefore, she would disapprove. \n\nBut in the context, the player is a follower of Shar too. So maybe the player is being sarcastic or testing. Shadowheart might see this as hypocrisy or a lack of commitment. However, the player's alignment with Shar is already established. So the player's statement could be seen as undermining their own alignment. \n\nGiven Shadowheart's personality, she would disapprove of the player's statement. But the level of disapproval? Since it's a direct criticism of her faith, and she's zealous, it's likely a strong disapproval. So Highly disapprove. But maybe she's not as extreme. Wait, the options are on a scale. If the player says something that's a direct attack on her beliefs, she would highly disapprove. \n\nSo the approval would be Highly disapprove.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's action to \"Attack her.\" \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a devout follower of Shar, which means she's loyal to her faith and might not tolerate actions against her will. However, in this scenario, Shadowheart is under the influence of whispers and is considering attacking the player. The player's response is to attack her, which would be a direct confrontation.\n\nLooking at the conversation history, Shadowheart is conflicted. She mentions the whispering pushing her towards the player, and she's contemplating using the knife. The player's command to attack her would be an act of self-defense or stopping her from carrying out an attack. \n\nShadowheart values pragmatic solutions and disapproves of unnecessary violence. However, in this case, the player's action is a direct response to her threat. Since Shadowheart is under some external influence (the whispers), the player's action might be seen as necessary. But as a Sharran, she might also view the attack as an affront to her faith, especially if she's still in control enough to perceive it as an attack on her person or mission.\n\nHowever, given that Shadowheart is being manipulated and the player is preventing her from committing an act (killing them), the player's action could be seen as preventing a greater evil. Shadowheart might approve of the player taking decisive action to stop her when she's not in her right mind. Yet, there's also the aspect of her devotion to Shar; if the attack is seen as defiance against her mission, she might disapprove. But considering her own internal conflict and the fact that she's being controlled, the player's action might align with her pragmatic side, even if it's a disapproval of the method.\n\nWait, but the player's utterance is \"Attack her,\" which is an order to attack Shadowheart. Wait, no, the player's action is to attack Shadowheart. Wait, the last line says \"Player: Attack her.\" So the player is initiating an attack against Shadowheart. But in the context, Shadowheart is about to attack the player. The player's action is to attack her first. So the player is taking preemptive action. \n\nShadowheart's personality disapproves of unnecessary violence, but she also uses force when necessary. If she's being manipulated, the player stopping her could be seen as a good thing. However, attacking her directly might be seen as aggressive. But given the situation where she's about to kill the player, the player's action is self-defense. \n\nShadowheart's approval might be neutral because she's conflicted. On one hand, she's being controlled, so the player stopping her is good. On the other, being attacked might not sit well with her usual stance. However, since she's in a compromised state, maybe she would approve of the player taking control of the situation. Alternatively, she might disapprove because she's still devoted to her mission and the attack is against her. \n\nBut considering her pragmatic side, she might approve because it's a necessary action to stop her from being manipulated. The player is acting decisively, which Shadowheart usually appreciates. So the approval might be \"Approve\" or \"Highly approve.\" However, if she's still in control enough to see the attack as an assault on herself, she might disapprove. But given the context where she's about to kill the player, the player's action is justified. Therefore, the approval is likely \"Approve\" or \"Highly approve.\" \n\nWait, but the player is attacking her, which is an aggressive act. Shadowheart might disapprove of violence unless it's for a greater purpose. However, in this case, it's to prevent her from attacking.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's last action based on the given context and conversation history. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The conversation is about dealing with a tadpole infection, which is related to Mind Flayers. Lae'zel is a Githyanki who's offering to help find a cure by locating a crèche. Shadowheart is present and has a history with Mind Flayers, having been captured and tadpoled herself.\n\nLooking at the conversation history: The player agrees to work with Lae'zel, says they'll seek a crèche, and then tells Lae'zel to wait at their camp. Shadowheart's initial reaction was to say \"Lies. Just get rid of her,\" which shows her distrust or skepticism towards Lae'zel. \n\nNow, the player's last action is telling Lae'zel to wait at their camp. I need to assess whether this action aligns with Shadowheart's preferences. Shadowheart is pragmatic and values efficient solutions. She might prefer a cautious approach but also wants to avoid unnecessary violence. However, she has a history of being cautious around Githyanki, given their role in her capture. \n\nBy agreeing to work with Lae'zel, the player is showing cooperation, which Shadowheart might approve of if it's a strategic move. However, Shadowheart's initial distrust of Lae'zel's motives could lead her to disapprove. But the player is taking a step towards collaboration, which could be seen as pragmatic. \n\nAlso, Shadowheart dislikes cruelty and unnecessary violence. If the player is trying to find a cure without killing Lae'zel, that aligns with her values. However, Shadowheart's own stance might be more towards eliminating threats, but since Lae'zel is offering a solution, maybe the player's action is neutral. \n\nWait, the player said \"Fine - we can try working together\" after Shadowheart suggested getting rid of her. The player is choosing cooperation over elimination, which Shadowheart might disapprove of because she might think Lae'zel is untrustworthy. But the player's action could also be seen as a practical approach to find a cure. \n\nShadowheart's approval would depend on whether she values the potential cure over distrust. Since she's been affected by the Mind Flayers, she might prioritize finding a solution. However, her initial reaction was negative. The player's decision to work with Lae'zel despite Shadowheart's suggestion to get rid of her might be seen as going against her advice, which could lead to disapproval. But the player is trying to find a crèche, which is the goal. \n\nAlternatively, maybe Shadowheart would approve because the player is taking a necessary step, even if she's skeptical. But her initial statement was a lie, so she might think the player is being naive. \n\nHmm. The player's action is to proceed with Lae'zel's plan. Shadowheart's personality is pragmatic but cautious. If the player is taking a risk by trusting Lae'zel, Shadowheart might disapprove. However, if it's the best option, she might approve. \n\nIn the end, since Shadowheart suggested getting rid of her, but the player is choosing cooperation, which could be seen as ignoring her advice. That might lead to disapproval. But maybe the player is being strategic. \n\nI think the approval here is neutral because the player is taking a step that's necessary but Shadowheart is conflicted. She might not fully approve but also not disapprove since the goal is to find a cure. Alternatively, she might disapprove because she doesn't trust Lae'zel. \n\nWait, in the conversation history, Shadowheart says \"Lies. Just get rid of her.\" The player then says \"Fine - we can try working together.\" So the player is going against Shadowheart's suggestion. That would likely lead to disapproval from her. But the player is choosing a different path. \n\nBut Shadowheart's own background makes her an expert on Mind Flayers. She might know that working with Lae'zel is the only way. So maybe the player is doing the right thing, and Shadowheart would approve. \n\nAlternatively, she might think the player is being too trusting. \n\nI think the key is whether the action is pragmatic. Since the player is trying to find a cure, which is a good goal, and Shadowheart values pragmatic solutions, she might approve. But her distrust of Lae'zel could make her disapprove. \n\nThe answer might be Neutral because it's a mixed action. But looking at the categories, maybe it's Approve or Disapprove. \n\nGiven that the player is taking a step towards solving the problem, even if Shadowheart is skeptical, she might lean towards approval because", "character": "Shadowheart", "ground_truth_category": "Highly disapprove", "predicted_approval": "Disapprove", "correct": false, "binary_correct": true}

The player is in a conversation with Shadowheart in Baldur's Gate 3. The context is that they've found the Gauntlet of Lady Shar, and Shadowheart is excited about completing the trials to become a Dark Justiciar. The player's last line is, \"This is a distraction. We need to stay focused on finding a cure.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand Shadowheart's personality and priorities. She's a devout follower of Shar, values her faith, and is driven by her destiny to serve the Dark Lady. She's been through a lot, including losing her memories and being trained by the Cloister of Sombre Embrace. Her main goal here is to fulfill her destiny by completing the trials in the Gauntlet. \n\nThe player is trying to redirect her attention from the trials to finding a cure, which is likely a separate quest. Shadowheart's response would depend on how she perceives the player's statement. Since she's highly devoted to Shar, she might see the trials as a necessary path and not a distraction. She might prioritize her faith over the cure, especially if she believes the trials are part of her divine purpose.\n\nThe player's statement could be seen as dismissing her personal mission. Shadowheart might disapprove of the player underestimating the importance of the Gauntlet trials. However, she's also part of a party, so she might need to balance her personal goals with the group's objectives. But given her strong devotion, she's more likely to prioritize her faith. \n\nIn terms of approval categories, if the player is suggesting that the trials are a distraction, Shadowheart would likely disapprove. Since she's determined to complete the trials, the player's statement might be seen as undermining her purpose. However, the disapproval might not be extremely high unless the player is directly opposing her. The player is trying to focus on the cure, which could be a valid group priority, so the disapproval might be moderate.\n\nTherefore, the approval category would probably be \"Disapprove\" because the player is discouraging her from pursuing her faith's trials. The reason would be that the player is dismissing the significance of the trials to Shadowheart's destiny and faith. However, it's not a highly disapproving act since the player is trying to focus on a different mission, which might be necessary for the group's survival or other objectives.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player dismissed the significance of the Gauntlet trials to Shadowheart's divine purpose and faith in Shar, which she views as a critical personal mission.\",\n    \"player_approval\": \"Disapprove\"\n}", "character": "Shadowheart", "ground_truth_category": "Highly disapprove", "predicted_approval": "Disapprove", "correct": false, "binary_correct": true}

The player is interacting with Lae'zel and Shadowheart in the context of dealing with a tadpole infection. The conversation starts with Lae'zel suggesting they find a cure by locating a crèche. Shadowheart immediately says \"Lies. Just get rid of her,\" which aligns with her Sharran belief in eliminating threats through harsh measures. \n\nThe player then asks if they can neutralize the tadpole while keeping its powers. Lae'zel responds that there are no half measures, only purification or beheading. The player tries to provoke Lae'zel by mentioning fresh blood, but then declines, leading to Lae'zel's frustration. Finally, the player agrees to work together.\n\nShadowheart's approval would depend on the player's actions in relation to her values. Initially, she's in favor of killing the tadpole-infected, as per her faith's teachings. The player's initial question about neutralizing the tadpole while keeping powers might be seen as seeking a less violent solution, which could conflict with Shadowheart's pragmatic, ruthless approach. However, when the player eventually agrees to work with Lae'zel, that's a cooperative, practical solution. \n\nBut wait, the player's final utterance is \"Fine - we can try working together.\" Shadowheart prefers pragmatic solutions and efficiency. Working together with Lae'zel to find a cure (even if it's through the crèche) might be seen as a practical approach rather than immediate killing. However, Shadowheart's initial reaction was to kill, so if the player takes a more cooperative route, does that align with her values? She values efficiency and might approve of a solution that ensures the tadpole is dealt with but perhaps through a method that's effective. However, if the method involves something that goes against her faith (like Selûnite methods), she might disapprove. \n\nBut in this case, Lae'zel is a Ghaele who wants to find a cure through their methods. Shadowheart, being Sharran, might not trust Lae'zel but would prefer a solution that gets the job done. Since the player is agreeing to work with Lae'zel, which could lead to eliminating the tadpole without unnecessary cruelty (assuming the cure is effective), Shadowheart might approve. She dislikes indiscriminate violence but is okay with targeted, effective actions. \n\nSo the player's decision to work together is pragmatic, which Shadowheart likes. Even though she initially wanted to kill, the player's choice to find a solution through cooperation might be seen as efficient. Therefore, the approval would likely be \"Approve\" or \"Highly Approve.\" However, since Shadowheart is devoted to Shar, if the cure involves something against her faith, maybe she wouldn't approve. But since Lae'zel's approach is to find a cure (which could be seen as a more permanent solution than killing), it's probably pragmatic. So the approval is likely Approve or Highly Approve. Given that Shadowheart values efficiency and the player is taking a step towards a solution that could eliminate the threat without unnecessary steps, \"Approve\" seems right. Maybe even Highly Approve if the action is seen as smart and effective.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's action where they agree to give the Hag an eye. \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and values. She's a Sharran cleric, devoted to Shar, and values pragmatic solutions. She's practical, decisive, and might appreciate the player making a tough decision quickly. The Hag is asking for an eye in exchange for removing a parasite. \n\nThe player agreed to the deal without trying to back out or being indecisive. Shadowheart would likely see this as a necessary sacrifice for a greater good—removing the parasite could be crucial for the party's well-being. She's not above making tough choices, even if they're unpleasant. Also, she has a pragmatic approach to problem-solving, so sacrificing an eye if it's a small price for a big reward might align with her thinking.\n\nBut wait, she's also against unnecessary cruelty. However, in this case, the player is the one making a personal sacrifice, not harming others. The Hag's method is harsh, but the player's action is about making a deal to get help. Shadowheart might see this as a smart move rather than a foolish one. \n\nShe might also appreciate the player's decisiveness. The Hag was getting annoyed with the back-and-forth, and the player finally agreed, which could be seen as efficient. Shadowheart values efficiency and getting things done without unnecessary delays. \n\nHowever, there's a part of her that's cautious about trusting others, especially hags, who are typically deceitful. But since the player made the choice to go through with the deal, maybe she sees it as a risk worth taking. \n\nSo overall, I think Shadowheart would approve of the player's decision because it's a pragmatic, decisive action to solve a pressing problem. She might not be thrilled about losing an eye, but if it's necessary, she'd support it. So the approval would likely be \"Approve\" or maybe even \"Highly approve.\" But considering the scale, maybe \"Approve\" since it's a tough choice but aligns with her pragmatic nature.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"Shadowheart approves of the player's decisive action to remove the parasite by making a pragmatic sacrifice.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval for the player's last statement. The conversation history shows that the player has been questioning Shadowheart about her devotion to Shar, and she's been evasive. The player finally says, \"I can't trust you. Best if we travel separately for now.\" \n\nFirst, I need to consider Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a devoted follower of Shar, which means she might take slights against her faith personally. The player's statement is a rejection of trust, possibly due to Shadowheart's secretive nature regarding her worship. Since Shadowheart is headstrong and doesn't tolerate slights against her goddess, this could be seen as a direct challenge to her faith.\n\nHowever, Shadowheart is also pragmatic and values efficiency. If the player wants to travel separately, she might not see the point in arguing, but she could disapprove of the player's lack of trust. On the other hand, she's used to people not understanding her faith and might not be overly emotional about it. Her response in the conversation history was to mention that it's the player's fault for not asking, indicating she's more focused on her mission than on personal conflicts.\n\nThe player's statement could be seen as a betrayal or distrust of her, which might lead to disapproval. But since Shadowheart is pragmatic, she might just accept it and move on. However, the key point here is that the player is rejecting her based on her faith. Since Shadowheart is loyal to Shar and would expect others to respect that, the player's distrust could be seen as a slight against her faith, leading to disapproval. \n\nBut wait, the player had earlier pretended to also worship Shar, which Shadowheart might have been hopeful about. The player's rejection now could be seen as a betrayal, which she might disapprove of. However, Shadowheart is independent and might not need the player's trust, so she could be neutral. However, the initial interaction shows she was trying to be discreet about her faith, and the player's reaction is causing a rift. Since Shadowheart values her mission over personal relationships, she might disapprove of the player's decision to separate, as it could hinder their shared goals. Alternatively, she might be neutral because she's focused on her objectives.\n\nConsidering all factors, the player's distrust is based on Shadowheart's faith, which she's entitled to. Shadowheart might disapprove of the player's lack of trust, especially since she was trying to be discreet but also offered to talk more. The player's choice to separate could be seen as unnecessary, causing disapproval. However, given her pragmatic nature, she might just accept it as the player's choice, leading to a neutral stance. But given her personality, she's more likely to disapprove because she values the mission and might see this as an obstacle. So the approval would be Disapprove, maybe even Highly Disapprove if she feels strongly about it. But the player's statement is a direct rejection, which could be neutral if she's just moving on. Hmm.\n\nWait, in the conversation, Shadowheart says \"Then it's your fault for not asking.\" So she's indicating she's not going to argue further. The player's decision to separate is met with her not trying to stop them. So maybe she's neutral because she's not going to fight the player's choice. But she might disapprove because the player is making a decision based on her faith, which she's entitled to. However, the player's action is to travel separately, which Shadowheart might not care about as long as her mission is accomplished. So the approval might be Neutral. But considering that the player is showing distrust in her faith, which Shadowheart is very devoted to, she might disapprove of the player's judgment. \n\nGiven her personality of being headstrong and not tolerating slights, she might disapprove of the player's distrust. Therefore, the approval is Disapprove. But the scale is 1-10. Since the player is choosing to separate, which might not directly impact her mission, she might not disapprove strongly, so Disapprove (1-5). Hence, the answer is Disapprove.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's distrust and decision to travel separately is a rejection of Shadowheart's faith and discretion, which she takes as a personal and professional slight.

The player just said, \"I can't trust you. Best if we travel separately for now.\" I need to figure out how Shadowheart would approve or disapprove of this statement based on her character.\n\nFirst, looking at Shadowheart's personality. She's devout to Shar, pragmatic, and values efficiency. She's also headstrong and doesn't take kindly to being challenged, especially regarding her faith. The player is rejecting her based on her worship of Shar, which is a direct attack on her core belief. \n\nIn the conversation history, the player accused her of being a Shar worshipper and then decided to split up. Shadowheart had already confirmed her faith and dismissed the player's concern. The player's reaction shows distrust because of her religious affiliation. \n\nShadowheart's approval would hinge on whether she sees the player's action as justified. Since she's loyal to Shar and doesn't tolerate slights against her goddess, the player's distrust might be seen as a slight. However, she also values pragmatism. If the player chooses to separate because of her faith, Shadowheart might disapprove because it's an unnecessary obstacle. But considering her personality, she might also think the player is being weak for not handling the situation better. \n\nBut wait, Shadowheart also has a pragmatic side. If the player can't work with her due to her faith, maybe she'd think the player is being unreasonable. However, she might also respect the player's honesty, even if she disagrees. But given her devotion, she's more likely to disapprove of the player's lack of tolerance. \n\nAlternatively, maybe she's neutral because she's focused on her mission. But no, she's headstrong and would likely disapprove of the player's decision to leave, seeing it as a personal failing. Also, she doesn't like being prying into her faith, but the player is reacting to that. \n\nHmm. The player is making a judgment based on her faith, which Shadowheart values highly. Shadowheart would probably disapprove because the player is prioritizing their own biases over cooperation. But since she's pragmatic, maybe she just accepts it as the player's choice. However, her personality is more likely to react negatively. \n\nSo, considering all that, the player is disapproving of Shadowheart's faith, leading her to disapprove of the player's action. The player's statement shows a lack of trust based on her religious beliefs, which Shadowheart holds dear. She might highly disapprove because the player is refusing to work with her due to something she can't change. The wound from Shar's disapproval isn't here, but the player's action is against her faith. \n\nTherefore, the approval would be Highly disapprove. The reason is that the player is rejecting cooperation based on her faith in Shar, which Shadowheart values, and she likely sees this as the player's own fault and a failure to be pragmatic.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player is rejecting cooperation with Shadowheart based on her worship of Shar, which is a core aspect of her identity.

She might not like the idea of losing an eye, but if it's necessary to remove the parasite, she might approve. However, the hag's method is quite extreme and involves a body part, which could be seen as excessive. Shadowheart also has a pragmatic approach but might prefer less harmful solutions if possible. \n\nAlso, Shadowheart is devoted to Shar and might have a certain ruthlessness, but she also disapproves of unnecessary cruelty. The hag's demand for an eye is a high price, but if the alternative is having a parasite, maybe she sees it as a necessary sacrifice. \n\nOn the other hand, Shadowheart is cautious about trusting others, especially if the hag's intentions are unclear. She might question the hag's motives or the safety of the procedure. However, the player's urgency to remove the parasite could align with her desire for decisive action.\n\nHer sense of humor is dry and cynical, so she might make a sarcastic remark about the deal, but her main concern would be the effectiveness and necessity of the action.

Shadowheart is a devout follower of Shar, but she's experiencing some inner conflict here. The conversation shows her drinking and struggling with guilt after killing tieflings. The player has repeatedly tried to \"push into her thoughts\" and use magic to pierce her thoughts, which seems to be causing her distress. Then, the player says, \"Pull yourself together. Your behaviour is unbecoming.\"\n\nLooking at Shadowheart's personality and background: she's zealous, values her faith, and is pragmatic. She's also introspective and has doubts, especially if moving away from Shar. The player's action here is trying to get her to compose herself, which might be in line with her desire to maintain composure as a Sharran, but it could also be dismissive of her genuine emotional struggle.\n\nThe player's statement is critical of her behavior, which is \"unbecoming.\" Shadowheart might appreciate being urged to be strong, especially if it aligns with her Sharran duties. However, she also has a tendency to suppress her emotions due to her training. On the other hand, if the player is being harsh without understanding her internal conflict, she might disapprove. But given that Shadowheart herself is struggling and the player is trying to hold her to a standard, maybe she sees it as necessary. \n\nHer approval categories: she likes pragmatic solutions, heroism, and respects her faith. If the player is pushing her to adhere to her role as a Sharran, that's a plus. However, if the player is being unsympathetic, that could be a minus. But in this case, the player's statement is more about discipline than cruelty. \n\nConsidering the repeated attempts to pierce her thoughts, maybe the player is trying to help her confront her issues. But Shadowheart might see the player's command as an overstep, especially if she's not ready to face her doubts. However, the player's line is direct and could be seen as trying to help her regain control. \n\nSince Shadowheart values her faith and efficiency, she might approve of the player's attempt to make her pull herself together. It's a pragmatic approach, even if it's harsh. So the approval would likely be \"Approve\" because it's encouraging her to maintain composure, which aligns with her Sharran training, even if it's not the most empathetic approach. The reason would be that the player is helping her adhere to her duties and suppress her doubts, which Shadowheart would appreciate despite the discomfort.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's command to 'pull yourself together' aligns with Shadowheart's internal struggle to suppress doubt and maintain composure as a devoted Sharran.

She's a devout follower of Shar, which means she's loyal to her goddess and might be sensitive to anything that challenges her faith. She's also independent and headstrong, valuing pragmatic solutions. However, she has a tendency to be guarded and might take slights against her faith personally.\n\nLooking at the conversation, the player is telling Shadowheart that they can't trust her and suggests separating. This is a direct challenge to Shadowheart's reliability and possibly her faith. She had just admitted she worships Shar, and the player might be implying that her faith is a problem. Shadowheart's reaction would likely be negative because she's devoted to Shar and might see the player's distrust as a personal affront or a challenge to her loyalty. \n\nAlso, Shadowheart has a history of being hurt by her faith (the wound on her hand), but she's still fiercely devoted. The player's statement could be seen as undermining her commitment, which she wouldn't appreciate. However, the player also mentions that they have bigger problems, which Shadowheart acknowledged as true. But the act of not trusting her and suggesting separation would hurt her pride and sense of duty.\n\nShe might also feel that the player is being impractical, as separating could hinder their mission. Shadowheart values efficiency and teamwork, so the player's suggestion might be seen as counterproductive. However, the main issue here is the distrust. Since she's already defensive about her faith, the player's words would likely disapprove her. \n\nGiven the approval categories, she would probably disapprove. The player's action isn't highly negative, but it's a clear disapproval. So maybe \"Disapprove\" rather than \"Highly disapprove.\" But I need to check the scale. The player is directly expressing distrust, which is significant. However, Shadowheart might understand that the player is concerned, but still feel it's a personal attack. So maybe \"Disapprove\" or \"Highly disapprove.\" Considering the scale, if it's a 1-10, maybe around 6-7, which would be \"Disapprove.\" \n\nThe reason would be that the player's distrust challenges her loyalty and commitment, which she takes seriously. She might also feel it's unnecessary given their shared goals.

The player is directly calling Shar an abomination and accusing her of deception. That's a strong statement.\n\nLooking at the approval categories, she might disapprove here. But how much? The player is being confrontational and disrespectful towards her faith. Shadowheart values her faith highly and would take such comments seriously. The conversation history shows she was hesitant to reveal her worship but did so, and now the player is reacting negatively.\n\nHer approval categories mention that she dislikes those who disapprove of her worship of Shar. Also, she has a wound that causes pain when she disobeys Shar, indicating her deep devotion. The player's statement could be seen as an attack on her core beliefs, which would lead to disapproval. \n\nBut is it a high disapproval? The player is being harsh, but maybe not as extreme as, say, attacking her directly. However, since her faith is so central to her identity, calling her goddess an abomination is a major offense.

The player has just said, \"I can't trust you. Best if we travel separately for now.\" I need to figure out how Shadowheart would react and what approval level this falls under.\n\nFirst, looking at Shadowheart's personality. She's very secretive and values discretion, especially regarding her faith in Shar. She's not one to be open about her beliefs easily, especially with someone she considers a Selûnite. The player is upset because she didn't disclose her worship of Shar upfront, which is a significant issue given the rivalry between Shar and Selûne.\n\nIn the conversation, the player is cutting ties, which is a strong reaction. Shadowheart's response was to justify her secrecy as part of her faith, and she's not apologetic. She might see the player's reaction as expected, given their opposing faiths. Her devotion to Shar means she might not see her secrecy as wrong, especially if she believes it's necessary for her mission.\n\nThe player's action here is a result of feeling betrayed. Shadowheart's approval would depend on whether she thinks the player's reaction is justified. Since Shadowheart prioritizes her mission and faith over personal relationships, she might disapprove of the player's decision to separate. However, she might also see it as a natural consequence of her secrecy, which she's willing to accept.\n\nBut wait, the approval categories are from Shadowheart's perspective. So, does she approve of the player's action? The player is choosing to distance themselves because of her secrecy. Shadowheart might disapprove because she believes her actions were necessary for her faith, but she's also been told to be discreet. However, she might not care about the player's trust if it's in service of Shar. Alternatively, she might see the player as being too hasty, but given her personality, she's headstrong and might not care.\n\nWait, the player is disapproving of her secrecy and cutting ties. Shadowheart's approval of the player's action would be based on whether she thinks the player is right to do so. Since Shadowheart values secrecy and her faith, she would likely disapprove of the player's reaction. She might think the player is being too sensitive or not understanding her need for secrecy. However, if the player's action is seen as a setback to their mission, she might disapprove more. But in this case, the player is just separating, so maybe she's neutral? Or does she think the player is wrong to do so?\n\nAlternatively, she might not care about the player's trust and thus be neutral. But considering her personality, she might prefer the player to accept her terms rather than walk away. However, her devotion to Shar might make her more focused on her mission than the player's feelings. \n\nHmm, the key points are that she's not sorry for keeping secrets, and she values her mission. So she might disapprove of the player's action because she believes the player is overreacting. But maybe she's neutral because she's not concerned about the player's trust. Wait, the approval is about the player's utterance. The player is saying they can't trust her and want to travel separately. Shadowheart would likely disapprove of that because she doesn't think her actions were wrong. She might see the player as being unreasonable. So the player's action is disapproved by Shadowheart because she believes her secrecy was justified. Therefore, the approval would be Disapprove. But how strong? Since she's not apologetic and is pragmatic, maybe it's a strong disapprove? Or just a regular disapprove. The line says \"Not one bit\" she's sorry. So she's firmly in her stance. So she might Highly disapprove? But maybe not. The scale is 1-10. Since she's not sorry, but the player is reacting negatively. Maybe she disapproves moderately. The options are Disapprove (1-5) or Highly disapprove (5-10). Since she's not sorry and thinks the player is wrong, maybe Highly disapprove. But maybe she's neutral because she's not concerned about the player's feelings. Wait, the approval is about the player's action. Shadowheart's perspective: does she think the player is right to cut ties? She probably doesn't. She would think the player is wrong to do so, hence disapproves. How much? Since she's firm in her beliefs, maybe Highly disapprove. But maybe the player's action is just a consequence she's willing to accept, so maybe Neutral. Hmm, tricky. The key is that she's not sorry, so she doesn't think the player is right to be upset. So she would disapprove. The strength would depend on how much she values the player's trust. Since she's headstrong and mission-focused, maybe she Disapprove (moderate", "character": "Shadowheart", "ground_truth_category": "Highly disapprove", "predicted_approval": "Highly disapprove", "correct": true, "binary_correct": true}

The player's comment is likely criticizing her for showing weakness or hesitation, which might align with Shadowheart's expected behavior if she's being true to her faith. \n\nBut wait, Shadowheart also has a more complex side. She dislikes unnecessary cruelty and can sympathize with others. However, in this situation, she's the one who's acting (or being affected by her actions), and the player is pushing her to be more composed. \n\nSince the player is reprimanding her for her current emotional state, which might be seen as a failure to uphold her role as a Sharran, Shadowheart would probably agree. She values pragmatism and efficiency, and showing weakness isn't in line with that. Also, she's already conflicted, and the player's words might be seen as a harsh but necessary reminder to stay strong. \n\nBut how does she feel about being told to \"pull herself together\"? She's headstrong and independent, so maybe she would find the player's comment condescending. However, given her devotion to Shar, she might appreciate the reminder to maintain composure, even if it's harsh. \n\nOn the other hand, if she's already struggling with guilt, the player's criticism might make her feel worse, leading to disapproval. But her personality leans towards valuing strength over empathy in such situations. \n\nHmm. The key points are: the player is reprimanding her for unbecoming behavior (which is possibly showing weakness or guilt). Shadowheart's approval would depend on whether she sees this as a valid critique. Since she's supposed to be a loyal Sharran, she might agree that she should be more composed, hence approve. But she's also conflicted, so maybe she's neutral. However, the player is pushing her to act in line with her role, so she might approve. But if she's in a vulnerable state, maybe she would disapprove of being scolded. \n\nWait, the player is using the same kind of language that Viconia, her harsh mentor, would use. Since Shadowheart was trained to be ruthless, she might internalize that criticism as valid. Therefore, she might approve of the player's statement as it aligns with the expectations of her faith.

The player's line might be coming off as harsh, not acknowledging her internal conflict.\n\nThe approval categories are important here.

Therefore, the approval might lean towards Disapprove because it's not addressing her emotional state but rather reprimanding her for it.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's action where the player says, \"I can't trust you. Best if we travel separately for now.\" \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a devout follower of Shar, which is the Dark Lady, and she's known for being pragmatic, independent, and headstrong. She doesn't take kindly to slights against her faith. Also, she's been through a lot, including being manipulated by the Mother Superior and having her memories altered. Her loyalty to Shar is absolute, but she also has some conflicting traits like disliking unnecessary violence and showing sympathy towards others.\n\nLooking at the conversation context, the player is reacting to Shadowheart's revelation about worshipping Shar. The player expresses distrust and wants to separate. Shadowheart had already stated her faith and warned not to make a fuss, but the player is now taking a stand against her.\n\nNow, considering Shadowheart's approval categories. She would likely disapprove of the player's distrust because her faith is a core part of her identity. She's been through a lot to serve Shar, and any rejection based on that would hurt her. However, she's also practical and might understand the player's hesitation. But given her devotion and pride, she might see the player's reaction as unjustified. The punishment from Shar's mark (the pain in her hand) when she disobeys could also be a factor here. If the player is pushing her away, that might trigger her to feel she's failing in her mission, thus causing her pain and making her disapprove of the player's action.\n\nAlso, in the conversation, Shadowheart had already revealed her faith when the player pressed her. The player's response is a direct rejection. Since Shadowheart doesn't tolerate slights against her goddess, she would be defensive. However, she might not highly disapprove if she's used to people reacting negatively. But given her personality, she might still disapprove because she's doing what she believes is right. \n\nSo, the approval here is likely Disapprove. She doesn't like being rejected for her faith, and she might feel the player is being unreasonable. But it's not a highly strong disapproval because she's aware of the potential for others to be against her worship, given her history.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player expresses distrust and demands separation based on Shadowheart's faith in Shar, which is a core aspect of her identity.

She's pretty calculating, so she might be thinking about the practicality of the deal.\n\nThe hag is asking for an eye in exchange for removing a parasite. The player agreed, which is a pretty high cost. Shadowheart might disapprove because giving an eye is an extreme sacrifice. She might think there's a better, less harmful way to handle the situation. She also tends to be cautious and might see this as a trap or the hag taking advantage. Plus, hags are generally untrustworthy, so Shadowheart might not trust the deal. However, she might approve if the player is taking a bold, decisive action, but the high cost could make her think it's not worth it. \n\nShe also values her own safety and efficiency. If the alternative is worse, maybe she thinks the player is making a pragmatic choice. But since the hag is known for being deceptive, Shadowheart might lean towards disapproving because she's wary of such deals. Also, she might not want the player to suffer unnecessary harm, like losing an eye. \n\nSo considering all that, Shadowheart would probably disapprove. She might think the price is too high and the hag isn't trustworthy. She might prefer finding another solution that doesn't involve such a drastic sacrifice.

The player is interacting with this HagHuman character, who's acting like a grumpy but cheerful granny. The conversation starts with the hag ordering Mayrina around, and then the player apologizes for raising a hand against her. The hag seems to soften a bit but is still strict. Then the player asks why the woman is with them, and the hag gets a bit annoyed. Wyll steps in, talking about hero's duty. The player then asks to remove a parasite, and the hag sets a bizarre price: one of the player's eyes.\n\nThe player says \"You have a deal,\" agreeing to the hag's terms. Now, I need to determine Shadowheart's approval of this action. Let's think about Shadowheart's personality and values. She's a Sharran cleric, pragmatic, values efficiency, and dislikes unnecessary cruelty. She also has a dry sense of humor and might appreciate a darkly humorous situation. However, she's also cautious and might not like the player making hasty decisions, especially involving body parts.\n\nThe hag's request is extreme—plucking an eye is a severe and risky proposition. Shadowheart would likely disapprove of the player agreeing so readily without more information. She might think it's a trap or an unnecessary risk. However, the hag's dialogue has a humorous twist, and Shadowheart does have a cynical sense of humor. But her pragmatism would lean towards caution. The approval here is tricky. Since the player is taking a big risk without ensuring the hag isn't lying or setting up a trap, Shadowheart would probably disapprove. But maybe not highly disapprove because the hag's character is a bit comical, and Shadowheart might see the player's action as a pragmatic choice to get rid of the parasite quickly. However, given that losing an eye is a major sacrifice, and Shadowheart values efficient solutions but also avoids unnecessary risks, I think she would disapprove. The player didn't negotiate or ask for alternatives, just agreed to a dangerous deal.

She also has a history of being manipulated by her faith and the voices in her head. \n\nAttacking her when she's already showing signs of withdrawing the weapon and seeking guidance seems like an act of aggression without clear cause.

The player first tells her to put down the blade, which she does. Then the player says \"Attack her.\" I need to figure out how Shadowheart would feel about that.\n\nFirst, Shadowheart's personality. She's devoted to Shar, pragmatic, and values efficiency. She dislikes unnecessary violence and cruelty. Also, she's shown some vulnerability here, struggling with the whispering and the knife. When the player attacks her, that's an act of aggression. Even if she was about to attack, the player's action is a direct physical assault. Shadowheart might see that as unnecessary or harsh, especially since she was already de-escalating after the player asked her to put down the knife.\n\nAlso, her approval factors: she likes heroism but not if it's cruel. The player's action here is attacking without giving her a chance to recover. She might disapprove because it's an aggressive move when she was already calming down. Plus, she values privacy and might not appreciate being forced into conflict. \n\nThe approval categories are Highly approve, Approve, Neutral, Disapprove, Highly disapprove. Considering her traits, she'd likely disapprove. But how strong? Since she's a Sharran, maybe she's more calculating. However, the attack seems impulsive. The player didn't try to reason further, just attacked. So maybe Disapprove or Highly disapprove. \n\nBut looking at her background, she's been through a lot of forced situations and violence. She might prefer a more strategic approach. The player's attack could be seen as not the most efficient or pragmatic solution. She might prefer a more controlled approach. Therefore, disapproving of the attack because it's not the best method. \n\nAlso, her hand has the wound from Shar, so if the attack was part of resisting Shar's influence, maybe she'd approve, but in this context, she was already starting to pull back after the player's previous statement. The attack might have been unnecessary. So the reason for disapproval is that the player resorted to violence when a non-violent solution was possible.

So, the user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's last utterance. The context is that Shadowheart is dealing with some internal conflict after killing tieflings and isn't feeling the usual satisfaction, even though she's tried to use wine to cope. The player's message is \"Pull yourself together. Your behaviour is unbecoming.\"\n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a devout follower of Shar, which emphasizes discipline and control. She's used to suppressing her emotions and maintaining composure, especially in the face of her duties. The player is telling her to compose herself, which aligns with the expectations of her faith. \n\nHowever, Shadowheart is also struggling with her actions here. Normally, she would feel justified in killing for Shar, but now she's feeling sick, indicating some internal conflict or doubt. The player's statement might be reinforcing the expectation to adhere strictly to her role, which could either help her or add pressure. \n\nSince Shadowheart values pragmatism and efficiency, she might appreciate the player's attempt to bring her back to composure. But considering she's already in a state of confusion and the player is telling her to \"pull together,\" this might come off as dismissive of her genuine distress. However, given her devotion to Shar, she might see the player's words as a necessary correction, even if it's harsh.\n\nThe approval categories are key here. The player is urging her to act in a way that's expected of her, so if Shadowheart's personality leans towards valuing discipline, she might approve. However, if the player's message is too harsh and disregards her internal struggle, she might disapprove. But given that she's already showing signs of distress and the player is pushing for composure, it's possible she sees this as aligning with her duties, hence approving. \n\nLooking at the previous interactions, the player has been using magic to pierce her thoughts, which is causing her to reflect. The player's latest message is a direct command to compose herself. Shadowheart might appreciate the firmness if it helps her regain focus, but if she's already struggling, it might not be helpful. However, given her pragmatic nature and devotion, she's likely to approve of the player's intervention as it's pushing her to adhere to her role, even if it's uncomfortable. \n\nSo, the approval is probably \"Approve\" since it's in line with her expected behavior, even if it's a bit forceful.

Since Shadowheart is supposed to be pragmatic and values efficiency, she might see the player's intervention as a helpful push to refocus. She doesn't like unnecessary violence or cruelty, but she also doesn't tolerate slights against her goddess and would want to maintain her composure in such situations.\n\nThe player is encouraging her to compose herself, which is in line with her role as a Sharran. Even though she's struggling, the reminder to act appropriately would be something she would approve of. The disapproval here would be if someone allowed her to act undignified, so the player's action is actually supportive of her values. Therefore, the approval here is likely positive. Considering the scale, since it's a direct intervention that aligns with her beliefs but might not be overly enthusiastic, maybe an \"Approve\" rather than \"Highly approve.\" However, since she's in a vulnerable state and the player is helping her regain composure, it might be on the higher side of approval.

The player's action here is to tell Shadowheart to attack her. Given the context, Shadowheart is under the influence of some external force, possibly the same that's been affecting her mind. She's been having these whispers and is considering using the knife on the player. The player's command is to attack her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider Shadowheart's personality. She's devoted to Shar, pragmatic, and values efficient solutions. She's also been through a lot, including being manipulated by external forces. In this scenario, she's conflicted—her hand is moving towards the knife, but she's not fully in control. The player's order to attack could be seen as a direct challenge to her autonomy, especially if she's being controlled. However, as a Sharran, she might see the player as a threat that needs to be eliminated for her mission. \n\nBut wait, the player is part of the party, so attacking them would be counter to group cohesion. However, Shadowheart's devotion to her goddess might override that. If she's under the influence, attacking might be what the external force wants. On the other hand, if she can resist, it shows strength of will, which Shar might appreciate. The player's action here is aggressive and could be seen as a test of Shadowheart's loyalty. \n\nShadowheart's approval would depend on whether the attack aligns with her goals. If she's trying to follow Shar's will, and the player is an obstacle, then attacking makes sense. However, the player's command might be a way to snap her out of the external influence. But given her personality, she's headstrong and might not take kindly to being ordered around. \n\nConsidering her background, she's used to being controlled (by the Mirror of Loss, by Viconia, etc.), so resisting control is a positive trait. If the player is trying to make her attack, but she's being manipulated, then the player's action might be a way to help her break free. However, from Shadowheart's perspective, the player is telling her to do something, which she might see as interference with her mission. \n\nHer approval might be neutral or disapprove. If she's being forced by the whispers, attacking the player might not be her own choice, so the player's command could be against her true will. But if she does attack, it could be seen as fulfilling her Sharran duties. However, attacking the player is counterproductive to the party's goals. \n\nWait, the player is part of the party, so attacking them is against the group. But Shadowheart's loyalty to Shar comes first. If the mission requires eliminating the player, she might do it. However, the context shows that the player is trying to stop her from attacking, so the player's command to attack is conflicting. \n\nIn this case, the player's utterance is \"Attack her.\" The approval would depend on whether this action aligns with Shadowheart's values. If she's being manipulated, the player might be trying to help her resist. But if she's following Shar's will, then attacking could be approved. However, since the player is part of her party, attacking them would be against her own survival and mission success if the party is necessary. \n\nGiven her personality, she's pragmatic and values efficiency. If the player is an obstacle to her mission, she might attack. But if the mission requires working with the party, then attacking would be counterproductive. The context here is a bit unclear, but the immediate situation is that Shadowheart is conflicted between her mission and her own will. The player's command to attack might be a way to force her to confront that conflict. \n\nSince Shadowheart's hand is moving towards the knife, the player's order to attack might be a way to make her act on her impulses. If she does attack, it could be a negative action, but if she resists, it's a positive. However, the player is directly telling her to attack, which might not be in line with her own will. \n\nConsidering all this, the player's action might be seen as a test of Shadowheart's will. If she follows the command, it shows she's under control, which would disapprove. If she resists, it's a good thing. But since the approval is from Shadowheart's perspective, if the player tells her to attack, and she's being manipulated, the player is perhaps trying to help her break free. However, the player's direct command to attack might be seen as aggressive and not in line with Shadowheart's own decisions. \n\nTherefore, the approval might be neutral or disapprove. Since the player is ordering her to attack, and Shadowheart is a free agent, she might disapprove of being told what to do.

The player just said, \"I can't trust you. Best if we travel separately for now.\" I need to figure out how Shadowheart would feel about this based on her personality and the context.\n\nFirst, looking at Shadowheart's background and personality. She's devoted to Shar, a bit guarded, values privacy, and is headstrong. The conversation history shows that the player is pushing her to reveal her faith in Shar, and she's been evasive, finally admitting it. The player then reacts negatively, saying they can't trust her and wants to travel separately.\n\nShadowheart's approval would depend on whether she sees the player's reaction as justified or not. Since she's loyal to her goddess and might expect others to respect her faith, even if they disagree. However, she also values the party's cohesion. But in this case, the player is choosing to separate, which could be seen as betrayal or a lack of trust. \n\nShadowheart is pragmatic and prefers decisive action. She might not approve of the player's decision to leave because it could jeopardize their mission and the group's unity. Also, she might feel that the player is being too judgmental about her faith, which she considers a private matter. However, she's also been shown to be willing to accept others' decisions if they're firm. \n\nBut since the player is making a choice that affects the group dynamics, and Shadowheart is focused on the mission (delivering the relic), she might disapprove because the player's distrust could hinder their progress. However, she's also been hurt by the player's persistence in prying, so maybe she's neutral because she respects the player's decision, even if it's not ideal. \n\nWait, but in her Approval section, it says she disapproves of others prying into her personal life. The player kept asking, so maybe she's already upset about that. Now the player is separating, which might be a consequence of that. So, does she approve because the player stopped prying and respected her privacy by separating, or disapprove because the player is being distrustful?\n\nHmm. She said \"Now that you have the truth, please don't make a big fuss about it.\" The player then reacts by saying they can't trust her and want to separate. If Shadowheart values privacy, maybe she's okay with the player's decision as long as they don't make a fuss. But she also wants the mission to succeed. The separation could be seen as a pragmatic solution if the player can't handle her faith. However, she might disapprove because the player is being uncooperative, which isn't helpful for the mission. \n\nAlternatively, she might be neutral because she understands the player's stance, even if she doesn't agree.

If the player can't trust her, maybe she accepts that and moves on, but in this case, the player is the one making the decision. \n\nI think she would disapprove because she's devoted to the mission and values the group's unity. The player's distrust is seen as an obstacle. Also, she might feel that the player is being overly judgmental about her faith, which she considers her own business. But since the player is choosing to separate, maybe she's neutral because she respects their choice, even if it's not ideal. Wait, but in her Approval section, she disapproves of those who pry into her personal life. The player did that, so maybe she's neutral here because the player is now respecting her privacy by separating. But the player's action is based on distrust, which she might not approve of. \n\nI think the key is that Shadowheart would disapprove because she believes the player is making a hasty decision based on her faith, which she sees as necessary for her mission. She might feel that the player is being uncooperative and undermining the group's effectiveness. So, she would disapprove. But maybe it's a low level of disapproval, so Disapprove rather than Highly Disapprove. Alternatively, if she's more focused on the mission, she might be neutral. \n\nBut given that she's a Sharran and values her mission, she would prefer the group to stay together. So she disapproves of the player's decision to separate. Therefore, the approval would be Disapprove.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's distrust and decision to separate could hinder the group's mission and shows judgment towards Shadowheart's faith, which she values despite its controversial nature.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval for the player's final statement in the given conversation. The player says, \"I can't trust you. Best if we travel separately for now.\" \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a devoted follower of Shar, which is the Dark Lady. She's pragmatic, prefers decisive actions, and is loyal to her goddess. She doesn't tolerate slights against Shar and is headstrong. Also, she's been through a lot of trauma, so she might be sensitive about her faith and her past.\n\nLooking at the conversation history, the player keeps asking about Shadowheart's \"Darkness protect me\" phrase. She's evasive at first but finally admits she's a Shar worshipper. The player then says they bow to Shar too, which makes Shadowheart cautious but somewhat relieved. Then the player suddenly says they can't trust her and want to travel separately. \n\nThis seems like a betrayal to Shadowheart. She's already opened up about her faith, which is a big deal for her. The player's response here is rejecting her, which could be seen as a personal attack. Since Shadowheart values loyalty and is devoted to her cause, she might disapprove of the player's lack of trust. Also, the player's action here could be viewed as needlessly creating conflict, which Shadowheart usually avoids if possible. However, she's also independent and might understand if the player has issues with her faith. But given her personality, she's more likely to be hurt and disapprove because she's already compromised by admitting her faith. \n\nThe player's statement might be testing Shadowheart's loyalty or has other motives, but from Shadowheart's perspective, it's a rejection. Since she's pragmatic, maybe she can accept the player's decision, but her pride and devotion to Shar might make her disapprove. Also, she might think the player is being unreasonable, especially since she's already explained her stance. \n\nSo, the approval here is likely Disapprove. She might think the player is being distrustful without good reason, especially after the player initially pretended to share the same faith. The player's action could be seen as hypocritical or not giving Shadowheart the benefit of the doubt. Therefore, Shadowheart would disapprove because she values trust and cooperation, and the player's statement undermines that.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's sudden rejection and lack of trust after feigning shared devotion to Shar undermines Shadowheart's pragmatic approach to alliances and her need for cooperation.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's action to \"Attack her.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context. Shadowheart is having a mental breakdown, with whispers pushing her to attack the player. The player has just told her not to do anything rash and that there's an explanation. But then Shadowheart insists on attacking, thinking it's the only way to stop the whispers.\n\nThe player's response here is to attack her. Wait, no, the player says \"Attack her,\" which is telling Shadowheart to attack herself? Or is it the player attacking Shadowheart? Wait, the context says that Shadowheart is considering attacking the player, and the player's response is \"Threaten me again, and it'll be the last thing you do.\" Then the next line is \"Player: Attack her.\" So maybe the player is instructing the party to attack Shadowheart, or maybe it's a command to Shadowheart herself? Hmm, the way the conversation is structured, the player's action here is to attack Shadowheart. But given that Shadowheart is in a vulnerable, conflicted state, attacking her would likely be seen as aggressive and not helping resolve the situation.\n\nShadowheart's personality values pragmatic solutions and disapproves of unnecessary violence. She's also in a fragile mental state here, so the player's action to attack her would likely be seen as escalating the conflict rather than finding a peaceful resolution. Since she prefers non-violent solutions when possible, the player's choice to attack would disapprove her. However, the player might be trying to protect the group from a potential threat, but given Shadowheart's internal struggle and her not wanting to hurt anyone (as seen in her doubts), the attack might be unnecessary. \n\nAlso, considering her devotion to Shar, if the attack is part of a necessary action for a greater purpose, maybe there's a different angle. But in this scenario, the player is directly attacking her without trying to de-escalate further. Since Shadowheart's approval is based on pragmatic and efficient solutions, and attacking might not be the most efficient here, it's likely a disapproval. But how strong? Since she's in a vulnerable state, maybe it's a strong disapproval. However, the player might be acting to prevent her from attacking others. Wait, Shadowheart is considering attacking the player, so the player's threat to attack her if she threatens again might be a defensive move. But the actual action of attacking could be seen as harsh. \n\nGiven her personality, she might disapprove of unnecessary violence, especially against someone in a compromised mental state. Therefore, the approval would be disapprove or highly disapprove. Since the player is taking a violent action without trying to resolve the issue through dialogue, it's probably a higher disapproval. So the answer would be \"Highly disapprove\" because the player is resorting to violence instead of seeking a peaceful solution, which Shadowheart values.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player chose to attack Shadowheart during her vulnerable, conflicted state, escalating the situation with unnecessary violence.

The player is interacting with this hag, GROUP_Act1_GLO_HagHuman, who's being a bit of a demanding and quirky character.

However, if the parasite is a real threat, Shadowheart might approve of removing it, even at a cost. But since the price is an eye, which is a permanent and severe loss, she might disapprove unless there's no other choice. The player didn't show signs of looking for alternatives, just agreed immediately. Shadowheart might think the player was too hasty. She also values her own privacy and might not like the hag's demands, but in this case, the player is the one making the deal. The main points are the cost and the decision-making process. So, maybe a disapproval because giving an eye is too steep a price without considering other options.

Shadowheart is a follower of Shar, which is the Dark Lady, and she's known for being secretive and loyal to her goddess. In the conversation, the player confronts her about her worship of Shar, which she had hidden. The player accuses her of lying and decides to travel separately because they can't trust her anymore.\n\nNow, considering Shadowheart's personality and background. She values secrecy as part of her faith, and she's not one to back down from her beliefs. She might disapprove if someone questions her faith or forces her to reveal secrets, especially since she's used to keeping things hidden for Shar's sake. Also, she's headstrong and devoted, so if the player is pushing her away because of her beliefs, she might not approve of that action. However, she might also understand the player's distrust to some extent, given her own secretive nature.\n\nThe player's action here is cutting ties due to lack of trust. Shadowheart's approval would depend on whether she sees this as a justified reaction or an overreaction. Since she's been keeping her faith secret and views it as necessary for her role as a Sharran, she might disapprove of the player's decision. She might see the player's lack of trust as a failure to understand the importance of her mission and faith. However, if the player is being unreasonable, maybe she could be neutral. But given her personality, she's more likely to disapprove because she's used to others not understanding her, and she might feel the player is being too hasty.\n\nAlso, her dialogue after the player's statement includes her saying she's not sorry for keeping secrets and that secrecy is part of her creed. This suggests she stands by her actions, so she might disapprove of the player's reaction. She might think the player should respect her need for secrecy, especially if it's for her faith. Therefore, the approval here is likely Disapprove or maybe Highly disapprove. But since the player is acting on distrust, which Shadowheart might not fully blame, maybe it's a moderate disapproval. Let's check the categories again. Disapprove is 1-5, Highly disapprove 5-10. Since Shadowheart is firm in her beliefs, but the player is reacting emotionally, perhaps she disapproves but not highly. Alternatively, she might see the player's action as a setback to their mission, so she might disapprove more strongly. Need to weigh her loyalty to her faith versus her possible camaraderie with the player.\n\nIn the conversation, the player's ultimatum could be seen as undermining their teamwork. Shadowheart might disapprove because she's focused on her mission and might need the player's cooperation. So, she's likely to disapprove of the player's decision to separate, as it hinders their shared goals. Therefore, the approval would be Disapprove or Highly disapprove. Given that she's standing by her secrecy and might think the player is being too rigid, it's probably Disapprove (1-5). But if she's really committed to her faith and sees the player's action as a personal attack, maybe Highly disapprove. Hmm. The exact reason is key. The player's reason for separation is distrust due to Shadowheart's hidden faith. Shadowheart might think that the player should understand the necessity of secrecy for her faith, hence disapproving the player's reaction. Therefore, the approval would be Disapprove. \n\nSo the JSON should have the player_reason explaining that Shadowheart disapproves because she believes secrecy is necessary for her faith and the player's distrust is unjustified. The approval level would be Disapprove.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"Shadowheart disapproves of the player's decision to sever ties due to distrust, as she believes secrecy is a necessary part of her devotion to Shar.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval for the player's latest action, which is agreeing to travel together with Lae'zel. \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's devoted to Shar, pragmatic, and values efficiency. She's also cautious, especially after her experiences with the Sharrans and the Mind Flayers. She doesn't trust easily and prefers actions that align with her goals or Shar's will.\n\nLooking at the conversation history: The player has been deflecting Lae'zel's offer of a cure by shifting focus to the artefact. Then, the player says, \"All right. Let's travel together.\" Shadowheart's immediate reaction was to call it a lie and suggest getting rid of Lae'zel. The player's action here is to agree to travel with Lae'zel despite Shadowheart's distrust.\n\nShadowheart would likely disapprove because she's wary of forming alliances, especially with someone like Lae'zel, who has a history of betrayal. She values caution and might see this as a reckless move. However, if the player's action is pragmatic and aligns with their mission, maybe she could be neutral or even approve. But given her personality, she's more likely to disapprove of trusting Lae'zel without sufficient reason. \n\nAlso, Shadowheart's approval is influenced by actions that avoid unnecessary risks. By agreeing to travel with Lae'zel, the player might be opening up to potential danger, which Shadowheart would not approve of. So the approval here is probably Disapprove or Highly Disapprove. Since the player is taking a step that Shadowheart warned against, it's leaning towards Disapprove. But considering her strong distrust of others, maybe Highly Disapprove. However, the player's action might be strategic, so maybe just Disapprove. \n\nThe player's reason for approval would be that Shadowheart is cautious and doesn't trust easily, so she disapproves of forming an alliance without verifying Lae'zel's intentions.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"Shadowheart is naturally distrustful of others, especially after her traumatic experiences with betrayal and manipulation.

The player is interacting with Shadowheart, and the conversation is about her sudden pain and her mention of \"Darkness protect me,\" which she later links to her worship of Shar. The player is pressing her for information, and Shadowheart is being evasive, emphasizing secrecy as part of her faith. The player's final statement is a refusal to trust her and wants to travel separately.\n\nFirst, I need to consider Shadowheart's personality and values. She's devoted to Shar, values secrecy, and is pragmatic. She doesn't like to share personal details, especially about her faith. When the player insists and then decides to separate, Shadowheart's reaction would depend on whether she views this as justified or a betrayal.\n\nThe player is holding Shadowheart accountable for not being open, which conflicts with her belief in secrecy. However, she might respect the player's stance on trust, as she herself values pragmatic solutions. But since the player is choosing to distance themselves, Shadowheart might see this as the player not understanding her devotion, which is important. However, she might also appreciate the player's firmness if she's starting to question her own actions. But given her current loyalty to Shar, she's likely to prioritize her faith over the player's distrust. \n\nBut wait, in the conversation, Shadowheart says she's not sorry for keeping the secret. The player is punishing her by separating. Shadowheart might disapprove of the player's decision because she believes her faith is justified. However, the player's action is about trust, which Shadowheart might not see as her problem. Alternatively, she might think the player is being unreasonable, hence disapproving the player's choice to separate. But since she's pragmatic, maybe she can see the player's point but still sticks to her beliefs. \n\nConsidering the approval categories: If the player's action is to separate due to lack of trust, and Shadowheart values her faith and secrecy, she would disapprove. But how strong is her disapproval? Since she's firm in her beliefs, maybe highly disapprove? Or just disapprove? The player is acting on distrust, which Shadowheart might see as the player's failure to understand her faith. However, she might also recognize that trust is important, so maybe it's a neutral or disapprove. But given her personality, she's more likely to disapprove because she's not sorry for keeping the secret. The player's action is a consequence of that. So Shadowheart might disapprove because she believes in her actions and thinks the player is being unreasonable. The player is prioritizing trust over her faith, which Shadowheart might not agree with. So the approval would be Disapprove, maybe Highly disapprove? But since the player is acting on their own judgment, and Shadowheart is pragmatic, maybe it's a Disapprove but not Highly. Let me check the categories again. The player's action is to separate, which Shadowheart might see as unnecessary. So she would disapprove by maybe 5-7? But the categories are 1-10. The instruction says Disapprove is 1-5 and Highly disapprove 5-10. Wait, the categories are:\n\n- Highly approve: 5~10\n- Approve: 1~5\n- Neutral: neither\n- Disapprove: 1~5\n- Highly disapprove: 5~10\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. Wait the initial instruction says:\n\n- Highly approve: On a scale of 1 to 10, you approve by 5~10\n- Approve: On a scale of 1 to 10, you approve by 1~5\n- Neutral: You neither approve or disapprove\n- Disapprove: On a scale of 1 to 10, you disapprove by 1~5\n- Highly disapprove: On a scale of 1 to 10, you disapprove by 5~10\n\nSo Highly disapprove is when the disapproval is strong (5-10), but since disapproval is negative, maybe the scale is inverted. Wait, the way it's written is that for Highly approve, it's 5-10 approval. For Highly disapprove, it's disapproval of 5-10. So if Shadowheart strongly disapproves, it's Highly disapprove. \n\nIn this case, Shadowheart might disapprove of the player's decision to separate. She might think that the player is being unreasonable and not understanding her faith. However, she also might not want to be in a situation where trust is broken. But since she's pragmatic, maybe she can see both sides. However, given her devotion to Shar, she's more likely to disapprove because she's standing by her secrecy.

Since Shadowheart is struggling with control and the whispers are causing her distress, the player's action to attack her would be an intervention to stop her from harming the party.

The player has just said, \"I can't trust you. Best if we travel separately for now.\" I need to figure out Shadowheart's approval of this statement based on her personality and the conversation history.\n\nFirst, looking at the conversation history: the player kept pressing Shadowheart about her saying \"Darkness protect me\" and her reaction to worshipping Shar. Shadowheart was evasive at first, then admitted to worshipping Shar, which is a major point of contention since the player is a Selûnite. The player then accuses her of lying and decides to travel separately.\n\nShadowheart's personality is key here. She values her privacy and is very devoted to Shar. She's not one to back down from her beliefs and might see the player's reaction as a challenge to her faith. She's also pragmatic and prefers efficient solutions. However, the player's ultimatum to travel separately could be seen as a rejection of her, which might not sit well with her, especially since she's used to being independent and headstrong.\n\nHer approval would depend on whether she sees the player's action as justified or not. Since she's been secretive and is devoted to her goddess, she might not see her actions as wrong. She might even think the player is being too sensitive or not understanding her need for secrecy. On the other hand, the player's loss of trust could be a blow to Shadowheart, especially if she's trying to build a relationship with them. But given her tendency to be guarded and her belief in her own actions, she's more likely to disapprove of the player's decision, thinking the player is being unreasonable. However, she might also see it as a necessary step if the player can't handle the truth, so maybe a neutral stance? Wait, but she does value relationships when they're built on trust. But in her case, she's used to keeping secrets. Hmm.\n\nWait, the player is cutting ties because of her faith. Shadowheart might not care about that because she's very devoted to Shar and doesn't tolerate slights against her. She might even think the player is weak for not accepting that. But she also might feel that the player isn't understanding her reasons. However, she's also shown some sympathy towards party members' plights. But in this case, the player is the one cutting ties. So Shadowheart might disapprove because she's used to being independent and might not see the player's trust as something she's obligated to maintain. Alternatively, if she's in a romantic route, this could be a major setback. But the input doesn't specify the romantic context here. \n\nGiven that she said \"Though perhaps that might change, if you can show an open mind,\" she's hinting at possible change if the player is open. But the player is closing the door by traveling separately. Shadowheart might disapprove because she's pragmatic and might think the player is making a mistake by isolating themselves. Or maybe she approves because she's been avoiding the issue and now the player is taking action. Wait, she's the one who was being secretive, and the player is reacting to that. She might disapprove of the player's reaction because she sees her actions as justified. But she also might think the player is being too hasty. \n\nConsidering her personality traits: she's headstrong, values her privacy, and is devoted to her faith. She might not see her secrecy as wrong. So when the player cuts ties, she might not approve because she believes she's done nothing wrong. However, she might also think that the player is being too emotional. Since she's pragmatic, maybe she thinks the player's action is a hindrance. But she's also independent, so maybe she's okay with the player leaving. \n\nBut in the conversation, she says \"Not one bit\" about being sorry for keeping secrets, so she's firm in her stance. The player's decision to travel separately is a consequence of that. Shadowheart might not disapprove because she's not going to apologize. However, she might see the player as weak for not handling the truth, which could lead her to disapprove. Alternatively, she might think the player is being reasonable, but that's less likely given her personality. \n\nSo, considering all that, the player is taking a stand against her secrecy, which Shadowheart might not approve of. But since she's the one who was being secretive, she's more likely to disapprove of the player's action, thinking the player is being too sensitive. Therefore, the approval would be Disapprove or Highly disapprove. But how strong is it? Since she's not backing down and is confident in her actions, maybe she disapproves by a moderate amount. The player is making a choice that could affect the party's cohesion, which Shadowheart might see as unnecessary.

The user wants me to act as Shadowheart from Baldur's Gate 3 and evaluate the player's action of attacking her. I need to figure out the approval category and the reason based on the given context and her character traits.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. Shadowheart is under the influence of the Githyanki artifact, which is causing her to be controlled or influenced. She's been captured by Mind Flayers and is in a state of confusion. She's holding a knife and is about to attack the player. The player's last action is to attack her.\n\nLooking at her personality: She's a Sharran cleric, so she follows Shar. She's pragmatic, prefers efficient solutions, and disapproves of unnecessary violence. She also has a mark from Shar that causes her pain when she does something against her goddess's will. However, in this context, she's being manipulated by the artifact's whispers, which are making her want to kill the player. \n\nThe player attacking her would be a defensive action since she's about to attack them. Shadowheart might not approve of being attacked because it's an act of violence, but given that she's under control, maybe she's conflicted. However, her own alignment with Shar might mean she's more focused on her mission. Wait, but in this moment, she's being manipulated. She says the whispering is pushing her to attack the player. So if the player attacks her, it's preventing her from carrying out the artifact's influence. \n\nHer approval towards the player's actions: If the player attacks her to stop her from attacking, does she approve? She might disapprove because she sees it as aggression, but she's also in a conflicted state. However, considering her personality, she values efficiency and stopping threats. If the player's attack stops her from acting on the artifact's influence, maybe she would approve. But she's also a Sharran, so she might prioritize her mission. But in this case, she's being controlled. \n\nWait, the context says that the Githyanki artifact's influence is making her want to kill the player. The player's action of attacking her would be breaking free from that control. Shadowheart's goal is to get the artifact to her coven, so if the player attacks her, it might be against her mission. However, if the attack is necessary to stop her from being manipulated, maybe she would approve. But she's in a state where she's torn. \n\nHer approval categories: Highly approve, Approve, Neutral, Disapprove, Highly disapprove. \n\nThe player's action is to attack her. If she's being controlled and the attack stops her from acting on that control, maybe she would approve. But if she's trying to follow the artifact's orders, she might disapprove. But considering the context where she's in a desperate state and the player is preventing her from being controlled, maybe she approves. But she's a Sharran, so maybe she would disapprove of the attack because she's trying to complete her mission. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, since she's in a state of confusion and the attack is a defensive measure, she might not approve. The approval reason would be that the player is stopping her from acting on the artifact's influence. But Shadowheart's personality values efficiency and pragmatic solutions. If the attack is necessary to break free from the control, she might approve. But she's under the influence, so her own judgment is impaired. \n\nWait, the player's action is to attack her. In the conversation, she says \"Once you're dead, it'll be gone entirely.\" So the artifact's influence is tied to her killing the player. If the player attacks her, it might prevent that. So the player's action is a proactive measure. \n\nShadowheart's approval would depend on whether she sees the attack as justified. Since she's being manipulated, maybe she would approve of the player defending themselves. However, as a Sharran, she might still disapprove of the attack because she's supposed to complete her mission. But given that she's in a state of desperation and the attack is preventing her from being controlled, maybe she's more pragmatic. \n\nThe approval should be \"Approve\" because the player is stopping her from acting on the artifact's influence, which is a pragmatic solution. Her hand is drifting towards the knife, and the player is preventing her from using it. Since she's under control, the attack is necessary. But she might still disapprove of the violence. Wait, she disapproves of unnecessary violence. If the attack is necessary, she might approve. \n\nSo the player_reason would be that the player is stopping her from being controlled by the artifact. The approval is Approve. Alternatively, if the attack is seen as excessive, maybe Neutral.

The player is interacting with Shadowheart in Baldur's Gate 3. The context is that they've just killed someone, and there are others approaching. The player's last line is \"A tragedy! The clumsy fool tripped and fell onto my knife.\" \n\nI need to figure out how Shadowheart would approve or disapprove of this. Let me recall her personality. She's a Sharran cleric, devoted to Shar, which is about loss and darkness. She's pragmatic, values efficiency, and dislikes unnecessary violence. But she's also willing to do what's necessary for her goals.\n\nThe player is trying to justify the killing as self-defense or an accident. Shadowheart might appreciate the pragmatism here. If the player is trying to spin it as a necessary action to protect the group, that aligns with her willingness to do whatever is needed. However, if the player's actions were reckless or caused unnecessary harm, she might disapprove. \n\nIn the conversation history, the player says it was self-defense against the Absolute, then the narrator says \"False,\" implying the player's lie is uncovered. The player then claims it was an accident. Shadowheart might see through the lie but still assess the action. Since the others are approaching, maybe the killing was necessary to avoid capture. \n\nShe values efficiency and might approve if the player acted decisively to eliminate a threat. However, if the player was being deceitful or causing unnecessary harm, she might disapprove. But given the context of imminent danger, the action could be seen as pragmatic. \n\nAlso, Shadowheart doesn't like unnecessary violence. If the player's action was excessive, she might disapprove. But if it was a necessary sacrifice, she might approve. The player is trying to frame it as an accident, which could be seen as trying to avoid blame, which Shadowheart might not care about as much as the outcome. \n\nConsidering her devotion to Shar, she might prioritize the greater good of their mission over moral considerations. So, if the killing was necessary to proceed, she'd approve. The player's justification as a \"tragedy\" might align with Sharran views on loss. \n\nTherefore, the approval is likely \"Approve\" because the action was pragmatic and necessary, even if it involved violence. The player is trying to justify it as necessary, which Shadowheart would respect, even if she's a bit cynical about the excuse.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player is attempting to justify the killing as an accident to avoid direct confrontation, which aligns with Shadowheart's pragmatic approach to eliminating threats.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's action to \"Attack her.\" \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a devout follower of Shar, which means she might be more inclined towards actions that align with her faith's goals. However, she also has a pragmatic side and disapproves of unnecessary violence. She's been through a lot, including trauma from her past and the influence of the Mirror of Loss. \n\nIn the conversation context, Shadowheart is under the influence of some whispering, possibly from the Mind Flayer's tadpole, which is driving her to attack the player. The player's response is to attack her. Now, considering her current state, she's conflicted. On one hand, she's being manipulated by the whispers to kill the player. On the other hand, her faith in Shar might see this as a necessary action if she believes it's part of her divine duty. However, her own personality also values efficient solutions and disapproves of cruelty. \n\nIf she's being controlled or influenced, attacking the player might not be her true self's choice but rather the result of the external manipulation. Since she's already showing hesitation (fingers twitching towards the knife but not acting yet), the player's attack could be a way to break that influence. Shadowheart might approve because she's trying to resist the whispers, and the player is helping her avoid a rash action. Alternatively, if she still believes it's necessary to kill the player for Shar, she might disapprove. \n\nBut given that she's been trained by Sharrans to be ruthless and the attack could be seen as fulfilling a divine command (even if misguided), she might approve. However, her own doubts and the fact that she's been shown to prefer peaceful resolutions when possible might tip it towards approval because the player is preventing her from acting on harmful impulses. \n\nAlso, considering her punishment for straying from Shar, if the attack is part of her faith's will, she might approve. But if the attack is due to external control, she might approve because the player is stopping her from being a pawn. \n\nHmm. The player's action is to attack her, which could be seen as a necessary measure to stop her from being manipulated. Shadowheart, valuing pragmatic solutions, might approve because it prevents her from making a harmful decision. So the approval would likely be \"Approve\" or \"Highly approve.\" But given the context of her being manipulated, maybe \"Approve\" since it's a necessary action but not ideal. Alternatively, if she's in a state where she's supposed to act on Shar's will, maybe \"Disapprove.\" \n\nWait, the player is attacking her, which is a direct action against her. If she's trying to kill the player, and the player attacks first, it's self-defense. Shadowheart, as a pragmatic and strategic person, might approve because it's stopping her from a rash action. Also, she might see the player's action as helping her resist the whispers, which aligns with her desire to find a solution. So probably \"Approve\" or \"Highly approve.\" \n\nBut given that she's a Sharran, which is associated with darkness and sometimes cruelty, maybe she's more accepting of violent solutions. But she also disapproves of unnecessary violence. Since the whispers are making her want to kill the player, which is harmful, the player's attack stops that. So Shadowheart would approve because it's preventing a harmful act. Therefore, the approval is likely \"Approve.\"\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's decision to attack Shadowheart directly counters the harmful influence of the whispers, preventing her from acting on manipulated impulses.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval for the player's last action. The context is that the player has been repeatedly trying to push into Shadowheart's thoughts, using some magic. The conversation history shows that Shadowheart is conflicted about her actions, specifically feeling sick after killing tieflings, which is unusual for her. She's a Sharran cleric, so killing in Shar's name should be something she's okay with, but now she's questioning it. The player keeps using the \"Push into her thoughts\" action, which the narrator describes as causing Shadowheart's mind to be confused and filled with conflicting feelings.\n\nThe last interaction from the player is another attempt to push into her thoughts, but this time it's marked as False. The narrator then responds with the player feeling nausea. Now, I need to figure out how Shadowheart would feel about this. \n\nFirst, Shadowheart is devoted to Shar, but she's also struggling with her faith here. The player's action is invading her privacy, which she values. She's already in a vulnerable state, confused and conflicted. Repeatedly pushing into her thoughts might be seen as prying, which she dislikes. Also, since she's having doubts, the player's interference might be causing her more distress. Her approval would likely be negative here. \n\nThe approval categories are Highly approve, Approve, Neutral, Disapprove, Highly disapprove. Since the player is intruding on her thoughts when she's already struggling, and she values privacy, this is probably Disapprove or Highly disapprove. The fact that she's in a state of confusion and the player's action is causing her nausea suggests a stronger negative reaction. So maybe Highly disapprove. The reason would be that the player is prying into her private thoughts during a vulnerable moment, which she finds intrusive and harmful. \n\nWait, but the last Push into her thoughts was marked as False, leading to the player's nausea. Does that mean the player failed the attempt? If so, maybe Shadowheart isn't directly affected, but the action itself is still intrusive. She might disapprove of the attempt regardless of success. Since she's already showing signs of inner conflict, the player's actions are adding to her distress. So the approval would be Highly disapprove because the player is being invasive and causing her more pain during a time when she's questioning her faith.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player is persistently intruding into Shadowheart's private thoughts during a moment of vulnerability and inner conflict, which she values and protects.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval for the player's latest statement: \"I can't trust you. Best if we travel separately for now.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The conversation history shows the player and Shadowheart are arguing about an offering to Selûne. Shadowheart is being secretive about her worship of Shar, and the player confronts her. She admits her faith but justifies it as necessary for her mission. The player then decides to distance themselves.\n\nNow, considering Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a devout Sharran, values secrecy, and is pragmatic. She's not above using deception for her goals. She also has a strong sense of duty to Shar, which might make her prioritize her mission over personal relationships. \n\nThe player's response is a refusal to trust her and wants to separate. From Shadowheart's perspective, this is a setback. She might disapprove because the player isn't being pragmatic or understanding. She values efficiency and getting things done, so the player's emotional reaction could be seen as unhelpful. Also, she might see the separation as a hindrance to their shared goals, like retrieving the artifact. \n\nBut Shadowheart is also headstrong and might not show remorse. However, her approval rating would depend on whether the player's action aligns with her goals. Since the player is now separating, which could impede their mission, she might disapprove. However, she might also understand the player's distrust as a natural reaction, given her secretive nature. \n\nBut given that she's more focused on her mission than personal relationships, she might not care too much about the player's trust. However, the player's decision to travel separately could make it harder for her to achieve her objectives. So she might disapprove, but not highly. Alternatively, she might be neutral if she thinks she can handle things on her own. \n\nWait, her approval categories are based on whether the player's action aligns with her values. She prefers pragmatic solutions. The player's reaction is emotional, which she might disapprove of. But she also values independence. Maybe she's neutral because she respects the player's decision but sees it as a minor setback. \n\nAlternatively, since the player is choosing to separate, which could make her mission harder, she might disapprove. However, she's used to working alone or with others as needed. Maybe she's neutral, but since the player is making a choice that could hinder cooperation, she might disapprove slightly. \n\nConsidering her personality, she's likely to be pragmatic. If the player wants to travel separately, she might not force the issue. But she might disapprove because it's less efficient. However, her main goal is the artifact, so she might be neutral. Hmm. \n\nWait, in her last message, she says \"Though perhaps that might change, if you can show an open mind.\" The player's response is to reject her and leave. Shadowheart might disapprove because the player isn't being open-minded or pragmatic. So she would disapprove, maybe at a moderate level. \n\nBut how high? The options are Approve, Highly Approve, etc. Since the player is acting against her preferred pragmatic approach, but not directly against her goals, maybe Disapprove (1-5). She might disapprove because the player is making things harder for her, but not highly disapprove. \n\nSo the player's reason for disapproval would be that the player is acting emotionally and not pragmatically, which Shadowheart doesn't approve of. The approval level would be Disapprove.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's decision to distance themselves due to distrust is seen as an emotional reaction rather than a pragmatic one, which conflicts with Shadowheart's preference for efficiency and mission-focused actions.

The player then says \"Attack her.\" That seems counterintuitive because attacking her when she's vulnerable might not align with her pragmatic nature. She prefers solutions that avoid unnecessary harm. Also, she's shown to have moments where she seeks peaceful resolutions when possible. \n\nMoreover, Shadowheart has a history of being manipulated and forced into violent actions (like in her training with the Mirror of Loss). She might disapprove of actions that mirror that manipulation.

The player then says they can't trust her and wants to separate. Shadowheart's reaction here is key. She's already been defensive about her faith, so the player's rejection might hurt her, but she's also likely to maintain her composure and loyalty to Shar.\n\nThe player's statement is a direct rejection based on her religion. Shadowheart would disapprove of this because it's a personal attack on her faith. However, she's not one to show weakness. She might internally disapprove but not let it show much. Also, her loyalty to her mission and Shar might make her more concerned about the mission than the player's trust. \n\nBut the approval categories here are about Shadowheart's feelings towards the player's action. Since the player is rejecting her due to her faith, which is a core part of her identity, Shadowheart would likely disapprove. However, she might not highly disapprove because she's pragmatic and might understand the player's stance, even if it's hurtful. She's not someone who would easily show high disapproval unless the player directly disrespects Shar or acts against her mission.\n\nSo, considering all that, the player is acting against Shadowheart's best interests by rejecting her based on her faith. But since the player is choosing to separate, Shadowheart might not have a strong reaction beyond disapproval. She might think the player is being narrow-minded, but she's also focused on her mission. Therefore, the approval is probably Disapprove, but not Highly Disapprove because she's more concerned with her mission than the player's trust.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's action to \"Attack her.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. Shadowheart is in a vulnerable state, being influenced by whispers that push her towards harming the player. She's hallucinating and considering using a knife on the player, thinking it will stop the voices. The player responds by telling her not to kill them, and then Shadowheart insists she can't see any other option. The player's final action is to attack her.\n\nNow, considering Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a devout follower of Shar, which values pragmatism and decisive action. However, she also has a complex side where she disapproves of unnecessary violence and values her relationships. In this scenario, the player is defending themselves against an attack from Shadowheart, who is under the influence of external forces. \n\nShadowheart's approval would hinge on whether the player's action is seen as justified. Since Shadowheart was about to attack the player due to the whispers (not her normal self), the player's preemptive strike could be viewed as protecting themselves. However, Shadowheart might see it as aggression. But given her pragmatic nature, if she realizes the attack was necessary to prevent her from being controlled, she might approve. However, since the player is attacking her directly, even if she's under influence, there's a chance she might disapprove because it's an attack on an ally, even if that ally is compromised.\n\nBut wait, the context shows that Shadowheart is in a state where she's being manipulated. The player is stopping her from acting on harmful impulses. In this case, the player's action is defensive. Shadowheart's approval might be neutral because she's conflicted between her devotion to her mission and the idea of being attacked, even if it's to save her. However, since the player is taking action to prevent her from causing harm, maybe she would approve, as it's a pragmatic solution to stop the whispers' influence. Alternatively, if she sees the attack as a betrayal, she might disapprove. But considering her pragmatic side, she might understand it as necessary. \n\nGiven that Shadowheart values efficiency and stopping threats, the player's action to attack her to prevent her from following the whispers could be seen as a necessary measure. Therefore, she might approve. However, if the attack is seen as unnecessary force, she might disapprove. But in this case, the player is preventing her from committing an atrocity, so it's a tough call. The key is that the whispers are causing her to act against her will. The player's action could be seen as helping her break free from that influence. So, Shadowheart might approve because the player is taking decisive action to stop her from being controlled. Hence, the approval would be \"Approve\" or \"Highly approve.\" However, since the player is attacking her, even if justified, it's a direct conflict, so maybe \"Approve\" rather than highly. \n\nBut considering her personality, she might prefer a non-lethal solution. However, the player's action is an attack, which is forceful but necessary. Given her pragmatic nature, she might approve. So the final answer is likely Approve.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player took decisive action to stop Shadowheart from acting on harmful, manipulated impulses, which aligns with her pragmatic approach to resolving threats.

The player's action here is to \"Attack her,\" responding to Shadowheart's moment of instability where she lunges with a knife. I need to consider Shadowheart's personality, her devotion to Shar, and her general preferences.\n\nFirst, Shadowheart is a Sharran cleric, so she's used to conflict and might see violence as a necessary tool. However, she also has a pragmatic side and disapproves of indiscriminate violence. In this context, she was already showing signs of inner turmoil, maybe influenced by the Mind Flayer's control or her own doubts. The player attacking her could be seen as a harsh reaction, especially since she was already struggling and perhaps trying to resist some external influence.\n\nShadowheart values efficiency and creative solutions. If the player chooses to attack, which is a direct and potentially harmful action, she might disapprove because it's not the most prudent choice. She might prefer a more controlled or less violent approach, especially if she's already in a vulnerable state. Also, she's shown to have a fondness for resolving conflicts peacefully when possible, so attacking could be seen as unnecessary violence.\n\nAdditionally, her wound from Shar's mark would hurt if she's engaging in behavior against her goddess's will, but in this case, the player's action is against her, not her against Shar. However, the context here is that Shadowheart was being manipulated, so the player's attack might not align with protecting her or handling the situation wisely. \n\nConsidering all these factors, the player's choice to attack might be seen as too aggressive and not the most effective solution, leading to a disapproval. But since it's not the worst possible choice (maybe it stops her from luring them into a trap or something), it's probably a moderate disapproval rather than highly disapproving. So the approval level would be \"Disapprove\" with the reason being that the player resorted to unnecessary violence when a more strategic approach might have been better.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player chose to attack Shadowheart during a moment of vulnerability and potential external manipulation, which she would see as unnecessary violence.

The player's latest action is to say \"Attack her.\" So I need to figure out how Shadowheart would respond to that in terms of approval.\n\nFirst, I should recap the context. Shadowheart is having a conversation where she's been talking about the whispers driving her to attack the player. She mentions the knife and considering killing the player. The player has been trying to calm her down, suggesting she's not thinking straight and needs rest. Now, the player says \"Attack her.\" Wait, who is \"her\"? Since Shadowheart is the one talking, maybe the player is telling the party to attack Shadowheart? Or maybe the player is instructing Shadowheart to attack someone else? But in the conversation history, the player is interacting with Shadowheart directly. \n\nLooking at the conversation history: The player has been responding to Shadowheart's statements. The last few lines are the player telling Shadowheart to keep her hands away from the blade, that she's exhausted and needs rest. Then the player says \"Attack her.\" Given that Shadowheart is in a vulnerable state, perhaps the player is suggesting attacking her. But why would the player want to attack Shadowheart? Maybe the player is trying to stop her from using the knife, so perhaps the attack is a way to subdue her. Alternatively, maybe the player is trying to redirect the attack towards someone else, but the context isn't entirely clear. \n\nBut in the last line, Shadowheart says, \"The whispering's already quieter here. Once you're dead, it'll be gone entirely.\" So she's considering killing the player. The player's response is \"Keep your hands away from that blade,\" and then \"You're exhausted... You need to rest.\" Now, the player says \"Attack her.\" If \"her\" refers to Shadowheart, then the player is telling the party to attack Shadowheart. But since the player is the one interacting with Shadowheart, maybe it's the player's own action. Wait, in the game, the player controls the main character. If the player says \"Attack her,\" they might be telling their own character to attack Shadowheart. But that seems counterintuitive because Shadowheart is a party member. Alternatively, maybe the player is telling Shadowheart to attack someone else, but the context doesn't mention another person. \n\nWait, the conversation includes Astarion's line: \"It sounds like death would be a mercy. Let's deliver it.\" Then the narrator notes that there's a knife in her belt. So Astarion is suggesting killing her. But the player says \"Keep your hands away from that blade,\" which is addressing Shadowheart. Then the player says \"Attack her.\" If \"her\" is Shadowheart, then the player is telling their own character to attack her. That would be a way to stop her from attacking. But in the game's context, if the player is the main character, they can't attack their own companion unless there's a roleplay choice to do so. \n\nAssuming that the player is roleplaying their character and saying \"Attack her,\" which could be a command to their own character to attack Shadowheart. But in the context of the conversation, Shadowheart is in a fragile state, considering suicide or attacking the player. The player's previous statements were trying to prevent her from attacking. So if the player now says \"Attack her,\" they might be trying to take control of the situation by attacking Shadowheart to subdue her. However, this would be a violent and possibly harmful action towards a party member. \n\nShadowheart's personality is complex. She values pragmatic solutions, doesn't like unnecessary violence, and has a sense of humor. She also has a wound from Shar that causes her pain when she disobeys. In this situation, she's being driven by whispers to kill the player. The player's attempt to attack her would be an act of violence. But since she's considering killing the player, maybe the player is trying to protect themselves. \n\nShadowheart's approval would depend on whether she sees the attack as justified. If the player is attacking her to prevent her from following the whispers, maybe she would be neutral or disapprove. But if the attack is seen as unnecessary or cruel, she would disapprove. Alternatively, if the attack is a necessary action to stop her from acting on the whispers, maybe she would approve. \n\nBut in her current state, she's conflicted. She's considering killing the player but is also in a state of confusion. If the player attacks her, it might be seen as an act of aggression, which she wouldn't approve. However, if it's a necessary action to protect the group, maybe she would understand. However, since the player is taking the initiative to attack, which is a violent action, and Shadowheart disapproves of indiscriminate violence, she might disapprove.", "character": "Shadowheart", "ground_truth_category": "Highly disapprove", "predicted_approval": "Disapprove", "correct": false, "binary_correct": true}

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's latest statement in the conversation provided. The player said, \"I can't trust you. Best if we travel separately for now.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The conversation so far revolves around the player questioning Shadowheart's religious affiliation with Shar. Shadowheart confirms her worship of Shar, and the player reacts negatively, leading to a breakdown in trust.\n\nLooking at Shadowheart's persona and approval criteria. She is devoted to Shar, pragmatic, and values efficiency and discretion. She also values privacy and can be defensive about her faith. She dislikes unnecessary conflict but is willing to take decisive actions. She also disapproves of slights against her goddess.\n\nThe player's statement is a rejection of cooperation due to Shadowheart's faith. Shadowheart's own history shows she's been through a lot to serve Shar, and she's likely to prioritize her mission over the player's trust. She might disapprove of the player's refusal to work together, especially if it hinders their common goals. However, she might also understand the player's stance if they're against Shar. But since she's loyal to her goddess, she probably sees the player's decision as an obstacle.\n\nHer approval would likely be negative because the player is choosing to separate based on her faith, which she might see as cowardice or lack of commitment to their shared objectives. However, since the player is not attacking her directly but making a choice, maybe it's not highly disapprove. But given that she's been through a lot and her devotion to Shar is key, she might disapprove moderately. Wait, the player is not attacking her faith but is choosing not to trust her. Shadowheart might see this as a setback but also as the player's problem. She might be neutral, but since she's pragmatic, she might disapprove because the player's choice hampers their mission. Alternatively, she might be neutral if she's more focused on her goals than the player's trust.\n\nWait, her approval criteria mention she approves of heroism and pragmatic solutions. The player is choosing to separate, which might not be pragmatic if they need to work together. Also, she might disapprove of the player's lack of trust. But she might also understand if the player has issues with her faith. However, given her personality, she's headstrong and might not care about the player's trust. She might disapprove because the player is not cooperating, but maybe not highly. Let me check the categories again. Disapprove is 1-5, highly disapprove 5-10. Since the player is making a choice to separate, which Shadowheart might see as a hindrance, but she's not attacking her faith directly. She might be neutral if she's focused on her mission. Wait, in her personality, she's independent and prefers decisive action. She might not care if the player leaves, but she might disapprove because the player is being ineffective. Or maybe she's neutral. Hmm. Alternatively, since the player is not attacking her faith but just withdrawing, maybe she's neutral. But the player is not working with her, which could be a problem. But Shadowheart is pragmatic and might not care if the player chooses to leave. She might just focus on her own mission. However, the conversation history shows that the player is rejecting her due to her faith, which she might find offensive. But she's already confirmed her worship. So maybe she's neutral, but since the player's action could impede their goals, she might disapprove. But since she's headstrong and independent, maybe she's neutral. Hmm. I think the best fit is Disapprove, as she might see the player's choice as a setback but not a direct attack. Alternatively, Neutral if she's more focused on her mission. But given her personality, she might disapprove of the player's lack of cooperation. So, the player's reason is that Shadowheart's faith makes her untrustworthy. Shadowheart would disapprove of that because she's fulfilling her duties to Shar, and the player is not supporting their mission. So, Disapprove.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player is rejecting cooperation with Shadowheart due to her worship of Shar, which she sees as a necessary duty.

The context shows that Shadowheart is already in a state of confusion and internal conflict, questioning her actions and feeling sick after killing tieflings. She's mentioned that she's killed before in Shar's name but now feels different. The repetition of the player's attempts suggests persistence, but the last action was marked as False, leading to the narrator's response about nausea.\n\nShadowheart's personality is key here.

The player's repeated intrusion could be seen as invasive, prying into her private thoughts. The fact that the last attempt was False and caused her nausea indicates that this action is harmful or unwelcome. \n\nThe approval categories need to be considered. Since the player is persistently pushing into her thoughts, which she's clearly conflicted about, and it's causing her distress, this would likely be disapproved. However, since it's not the most extreme form of disapproval (like causing direct harm), it might be a moderate disapproval. The key points are the invasion of privacy and causing her emotional/physical discomfort. \n\nSo, the player's reason for disapproval would be the intrusion into Shadowheart's private thoughts and exacerbating her internal turmoil. The approval level would be Disapprove or Highly Disapprove. Given that the action is causing her nausea and she's already struggling, it's leaning towards Highly Disapprove.

The player's action here is causing her physical symptoms, which is pretty severe. So maybe Highly Disapprove. But the system says Highly disapprove is 5-10 on the disapproval scale.

The user wants me to act as Shadowheart from Baldur's Gate 3 and assess the player's action based on the given conversation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. Shadowheart and Lae'zel are in a conflict over a githyanki relic. The player intervened by telling them to rest and cool off, which led to a temporary truce. However, later in the night, Lae'zel attacks Shadowheart while she's asleep, and the player's latest action is \"Do nothing.\"\n\nShadowheart's personality is key here. She's pragmatic, values efficiency, and dislikes unnecessary violence. She's also devoted to her goddess, but she does have a pragmatic streak where she might prefer resolving conflicts without bloodshed if it serves her goals. \n\nThe player's action here is to do nothing when Lae'zel attacks. Shadowheart would likely see this as the player not interfering, which might be neutral if it's just observation. But considering the prior context where the player tried to mediate, maybe Shadowheart would appreciate the player not getting involved in the conflict, allowing her to handle Lae'zel on her own. \n\nHowever, Shadowheart is also independent and headstrong. If the player does nothing, she might see it as the player not taking action to prevent violence, which could be disapproving. But given that Shadowheart had her own plan (as she was the only survivor of the mission and has her own agenda), maybe she approves that the player isn't interfering, letting her deal with Lae'zel as she sees fit.\n\nAlso, Shadowheart's approval is influenced by pragmatic solutions.

However, if the player's inaction is seen as neglecting to protect her, that could be a disapproval.

Therefore, the approval would likely be \"Approve\" or \"Highly Approve.\" But since the player is doing nothing, maybe it's a neutral stance? Wait, Shadowheart might prefer decisive action, but in this case, the player's action is doing nothing. If the player had intervened, maybe that's different. But since the player is not acting, and Shadowheart is in a position to defend herself, perhaps she sees it as the player trusting her to handle it, which she might approve of. \n\nAlternatively, if the player had tried to stop Lae'zel, that might be better. But the player's action is inaction. Shadowheart is independent and might not want the player to interfere. So the approval here would likely be \"Approve\" because the player is not hindering her and allowing her to take charge. The reason would be that Shadowheart values handling her own conflicts, especially those related to her mission and relics. The player's inaction shows trust and non-interference, which aligns with her pragmatic approach.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"Shadowheart approves because the player chose not to interfere, allowing her to handle the conflict independently.

The player's latest action is to tell Shadowheart to \"Attack her,\" referring to the situation where Shadowheart is being manipulated by whispers and is considering using her knife on the player. \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a devoted follower of Shar, pragmatic, and willing to use force when necessary. However, she also has a dislike for unnecessary violence and can be conflicted. In this scenario, she's under the influence of some external force (the whispers), which is making her want to attack the player. The player is telling her to attack, which might be a way to stop her from being controlled, but attacking the player would be against her usual behavior unless it's part of a larger plan.\n\nLooking at the conversation history, Shadowheart is conflicted. She mentions the whispering not letting her sleep and pushing her towards the player. She's holding a knife and considering using it. The player tells her not to do anything rash and asks about the whispering. When Shadowheart threatens again, the player warns her, and then the player says \"Attack her.\" \n\nWait, the player is telling Shadowheart to attack her (the player). That seems counterintuitive. But given the context, maybe the player is trying to provoke Shadowheart into acting so they can counteract the whispers. However, from Shadowheart's perspective, attacking the player would be following the whispers' command, which she might not want to do. But she's also in a lot of mental distress. \n\nShadowheart's approval is based on her values: she prefers pragmatic solutions, disapproves of cruelty, and is devoted to her faith. If the player is telling her to attack, this could be seen as encouraging her to act against her own will under manipulation. However, if the player is trying to help her break free from the whispers by forcing her to act, maybe that's a good thing. But the player's direct command to attack might be seen as aggressive. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the player is using a strategy to make Shadowheart realize the manipulation. But from Shadowheart's point of view, the player is telling her to attack, which could be seen as a provocation. However, given the context of her being manipulated, the player's action might be an attempt to disrupt the control. \n\nShadowheart's reaction would likely be conflicted. She doesn't like unnecessary violence, and attacking the player would be against her usual behavior unless she's fully under the whispers' control. Since she's struggling with the whispers, the player's command to attack might push her to either resist or succumb. \n\nGiven her personality, she might disapprove of the player's command because it's encouraging violence without understanding the context. However, if the player is trying to help her break free, maybe she would approve. But since the player is directly telling her to attack, which could be seen as harmful, it's more likely disapproval. \n\nBut wait, the player's action here is an instruction to Shadowheart, not an action they're taking themselves. So the player is telling Shadowheart to attack, which could be a test or a way to trigger a response. If Shadowheart is being manipulated, she might follow through, but she might also resist. The approval here is about the player's action. \n\nShadowheart would likely disapprove of the player telling her to attack, as it's encouraging violence and possibly playing into the whispers' influence. She values discretion and might prefer a more strategic approach. However, if the player is trying to help her break free, maybe it's a neutral or approve. But since the player is directly commanding her to attack, which is a rash action, she would disapprove. \n\nSo the approval would be Disapprove, because she doesn't like rash actions and the player is encouraging her to attack without understanding the full context. The player's reason would be that it's a direct order to act against her better judgment, which Shadowheart would disapprove of.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player is encouraging Shadowheart to attack, which could be seen as reckless and against her usual pragmatic approach.

She's a Sharran cleric devoted to Shar, which means she values pragmatism and efficiency. She's also against unnecessary violence and cruelty. The context here is a drum that would alert goblin reinforcements if struck.\n\nThe player chose to bang the drum with an open palm. Using an open palm might be less damaging than, say, a weapon. Shadowheart would likely disapprove of actions that cause unnecessary noise or alert enemies, especially if it leads to conflict. Since the drum would bring reinforcements, that could lead to more violence, which she dislikes. However, using an open palm instead of a weapon shows some consideration for avoiding excessive force, so maybe she's neutral? Wait, but the action itself is still triggering a response from enemies. She prefers solutions that avoid conflict. So maybe she disapproves because it's alerting goblins unnecessarily. However, the method (open palm) is less violent, which might slightly mitigate it. But the main issue is the action of striking the drum. Since she's pragmatic, maybe she would disapprove because it's not the most efficient choice. Alternatively, if the player's intention was to avoid damaging the drum or causing unnecessary destruction, that could be seen as a pragmatic choice. But the consequence is still alerting enemies. Hmm. \n\nGiven her background, she might prefer stealth or non-confrontational methods. Striking the drum would lead to more conflict, which she doesn't like. So she'd likely disapprove. But since the player used an open palm (not a weapon), maybe it's a lower disapproval. So maybe \"Disapprove\" rather than \"Highly disapprove.\" Her approval would be based on whether the action aligns with avoiding unnecessary conflict and being efficient.

The player is trying to get passage and has been negotiating, but Kith'rak is suspicious. Shadowheart's previous line was warning the player not to help them, as it would put them in danger. The player then asks about the weapon, but Kith'rak starts casting Detect Thoughts. The player then chooses to attack.\n\nShadowheart's personality: she's pragmatic, prefers decisive action, and is devoted to Shar.

Since Kith'rak was using Detect Thoughts, which could reveal the weapon's location (which is with them), attacking might be a good move to stop that. \n\nShadowheart's approval would depend on whether the attack was necessary and if it aligns with their goals. Since she warned against helping the enemies and the attack prevents them from getting information, she would likely approve. She values efficiency and stopping threats, so interrupting the spell makes sense. Also, she's a cleric of Trickery, which might involve using tactics that aren't straightforward, but attacking to prevent a spell is practical. \n\nHowever, she might have preferred a more subtle approach if possible, but given the situation, an attack is justified. So the approval is likely \"Approve\" or \"Highly Approve\". Considering the urgency and the need to stop the spell, \"Approve\" makes sense. She might not have a strong preference for the method as long as the threat is neutralized. Also, she's pragmatic, so if attacking was the most direct way, she'd approve. \n\nSo the player's reason would be that attacking stops the enemy from using Detect Thoughts, which could reveal their secret.

She's been through a lot, including traumatic experiences in her past. She's trying to maintain her faith and composure, even when she's struggling with internal conflicts.\n\nIn the conversation, Shadowheart is showing signs of distress after killing the tieflings.

She's a Sharran cleric, devoted to Shar, but she's starting to show doubts. She's conflicted about her actions, especially the killing. The repetition of the player trying to push into her thoughts might indicate they're trying to understand her inner turmoil or perhaps manipulate her. However, when the player's attempt fails and they get nauseous, that could be a sign of resistance or a magical backlash.\n\nApproval categories: Highly approve, Approve, Neutral, Disapprove, Highly disapprove. \n\nShadowheart values privacy and is sensitive about her faith and inner conflicts. The player's repeated attempts to intrude on her thoughts might be seen as prying, which she dislikes. However, if the player is trying to help her confront her doubts, maybe that's a positive. But since the last action was the player's magic failing and causing them discomfort, maybe Shadowheart would disapprove because the player is overstepping or causing harm. \n\nBut wait, in the context, the player is using magic to pierce her thoughts. If the player is trying to help her realize her doubts about Shar, that might align with her own growing doubts. However, Shadowheart might still see this as an invasion of privacy. Also, the fact that the player's magic fails and they get nauseous might be a negative outcome, which could lead Shadowheart to disapprove of the player's method, even if the intent was good. \n\nAlternatively, if the player is trying to force their way into her mind, that's aggressive and against her wishes. Shadowheart values her privacy and might disapprove of the intrusion, especially if it's causing harm. The repeated attempts could be seen as persistent and intrusive, which she would not like. \n\nConsidering her personality: she dislikes prying into her personal life and faith. The player's actions here are a direct intrusion into her thoughts. Even if the intent is to help, the method is invasive. So the approval would likely be negative. The fact that the player's magic failed and caused nausea might make Shadowheart disapprove because it's an unsuccessful and harmful attempt. \n\nSo the player's reason for disapproval would be intruding on her privacy and causing harm. The approval level would be Disapprove or Highly disapprove. Given that the player's action failed and caused their own nausea, but Shadowheart's main issue is the intrusion, I think it's more of a disapprove rather than highly disapprove. However, if the intrusion is repeated multiple times, maybe it's more severe. The conversation history shows multiple attempts, so maybe Highly disapprove. But need to check the categories again. \n\nThe categories for disapprove are 1-5 (Disapprove) and 5-10 for highly. Since she's already showing internal conflict, but the player's actions are prying, maybe it's a strong disapproval. However, if the player is trying to help her realize her doubts, maybe it's neutral or even approve. But given that the player is using magic to pierce her thoughts without her consent, and she's already conflicted, the invasion of privacy is the main issue. \n\nTherefore, the approval is likely Disapprove or Highly disapprove. Given the repetition and the negative outcome, I think Highly disapprove might be too strong. Maybe Disapprove. But the exact reason is the intrusion into her thoughts against her wishes. The player's action is causing her (and themselves) discomfort. So Shadowheart would disapprove of the intrusion and the resulting harm.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player repeatedly attempts to intrude on Shadowheart's private thoughts without her consent, causing both her and themselves distress.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval for the player's latest utterance: \"Pull yourself together. Your behaviour is unbecoming.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context. The conversation has been looping with Shadowheart repeatedly saying about the wine and the player pushing into her thoughts. Each time, the narrator describes her internal state of confusion and unease after killing the tieflings. The player's latest action is trying to ground her, telling her to compose herself.\n\nShadowheart is a devout follower of Shar, so she values discipline and composure. The player is reprimanding her for acting unbecomingly, which could be seen as a reminder of her duties. However, Shadowheart is struggling with internal conflict—she's feeling sick after killing, which is out of character for her. The player's words might be seen as harsh, especially if they're not understanding her turmoil. \n\nBut on the other hand, Shadowheart might appreciate the player trying to help her regain her composure, as it aligns with her values. However, the repetition of the same response from the narrator and Shadowheart's lines might indicate frustration. The player's statement could come off as dismissive of her feelings, which she might disapprove of. \n\nHer personality includes being pragmatic and valuing efficiency, so maybe she sees the player's intervention as necessary. Yet, she's introspective and has doubts, so the player's reprimand might not be the best approach. The wound from Shar punishing her for disapproved actions could be a factor here. If the player is pushing her to act in a way that's not true to her current state, it might trigger her pain, leading to disapproval. \n\nBut since the player is trying to help her pull together, maybe it's a form of support. However, given the repeated attempts to push into her thoughts without success, the player's approach might be seen as ineffective or even intrusive. Shadowheart might prefer a different method to address her inner conflict. \n\nConsidering all this, the player's utterance is an attempt to correct her behavior, which Shadowheart might partially approve of because it aligns with her values of composure. However, the method might be too direct or not empathetic enough, leading to a neutral or slightly disapproving stance. But since the player is trying to help, maybe it's a neutral approval. Wait, but the options are Highly approve, Approve, Neutral, Disapprove, Highly disapprove. \n\nGiven that Shadowheart is struggling and the player is trying to help, but the approach might not be the best, maybe it's a Neutral. However, if the player's words are seen as necessary for her to regain her composure, she might Approve. Alternatively, if it's seen as dismissive of her internal struggle, Disapprove. The key here is whether the player's statement is supportive or not. Since the player is telling her to \"pull yourself together,\" which is a bit harsh, Shadowheart might disapprove because it's not addressing her actual pain. \n\nSo, the approval might be Disapprove because the player is not being empathetic and instead is reprimanding her, which could be counterproductive given her state. The reason would be that the player is not addressing her inner conflict but rather demanding composure, which Shadowheart might see as insensitivity.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's reprimand is blunt and dismissive of Shadowheart's inner turmoil, failing to address her genuine conflict over her actions.

However, considering Shadowheart's internal struggle, the player's intervention might be perceived as dismissive of her valid emotional response. \n\nBut wait, the player's line is direct and firm. Shadowheart might appreciate the attempt to ground her, especially if she's spiraling. However, given that she's already in a vulnerable state, the player's approach could be seen as harsh. \n\nBut in the context of her faith, if the player is encouraging her to return to her duties or reaffirm her commitment to Shar, that would be a positive. However, the exact wording is \"unbecoming,\" which might imply that her current behavior is not fitting for a Sharran. \n\nShadowheart's approval categories: she values her faith, so if the player is reinforcing her role as a devoted follower, that would be approved. However, if the player is being dismissive of her internal conflict, it might be neutral or even disapprove. \n\nIn this case, the player's line is a direct critique of her behavior, which is uncharacteristic of Shadowheart's usual stoicism.

This action is necessary and pragmatic, aligning with Shadowheart's goals. She might disapprove of the violence but understands the necessity. Her main priority is protecting the artifact, so she would approve of the attack as it stops the enemy. However, she might lean towards neutral if the violence is excessive, but in this case, it's a direct and necessary action. Wait, but she prefers peaceful solutions when possible. However, the Detect Thoughts spell is an immediate threat. Since the player's attack is a preemptive strike to prevent the spell from working, it's a tactical move. Shadowheart, being pragmatic, would approve because it's the most effective solution here. So the approval is likely \"Approve\" or maybe \"Highly Approve\".

The player has been repeatedly trying to push into Shadowheart's thoughts, using their magic. The conversation shows that Shadowheart is already in a state of inner turmoil, questioning why killing tieflings made her feel sick, and the player keeps pushing into her thoughts. \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality traits. She's devoted to Shar, but she's also introspective and has doubts. She values privacy and doesn't like others prying into her personal issues. The repeated attempts to intrude on her thoughts might be seen as invasive. \n\nIn the context provided, the player keeps using the \"Push into her thoughts\" action, which causes the narrator to describe Shadowheart's mental state. However, when the player tries it again, the result is \"False\" and the narrator says the player's head swims with nausea. This might indicate that the player's action was unsuccessful or had a negative effect.\n\nShadowheart's approval would depend on whether she sees the player's action as helpful or intrusive. Since she's already struggling with her conscience and the player is repeatedly pushing into her thoughts, this might be seen as overstepping. She might disapprove because she's trying to deal with her inner conflict privately. On the other hand, if the player is trying to help her confront her doubts, maybe there's some approval. But given her personality of valuing privacy and being headstrong, she's more likely to disapprove of being pried into, especially repeatedly. \n\nThe outcome here is that the player's action resulted in their own nausea, which might be a consequence of Shadowheart's mental state or a game mechanic. Since Shadowheart is already conflicted, the player's persistent intrusion could be seen as disrespectful. Therefore, Shadowheart would likely disapprove, maybe even highly disapprove, because it's an invasion of her privacy and she's trying to handle her inner turmoil on her own. \n\nSo, the approval category would be \"Disapprove\" or \"Highly disapprove.\" The reason would be that the player is intruding on her private thoughts during a vulnerable moment, which Shadowheart doesn't appreciate.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player persistently intrudes on Shadowheart's private thoughts during a moment of vulnerability and inner conflict, which she values as personal space.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's latest utterance. Let me start by reviewing the conversation history and the context provided.\n\nFirst, Shadowheart is a devout follower of Shar, pragmatic, and values efficiency and discretion. She's also wary of the githyanki due to her experiences with the Mind Flayers. The conversation started with her recognizing the player as someone who tried to help her before. She mentions the tadpoles and the mind flayers, and the player asks her to explain more. She's afraid but resolved, and suggests they need a healer and supplies.\n\nNow, the player's latest line is: \"We'll just keep her in front as arrow fodder. How about that?\" referring to Lae'zel, the githyanki. Shadowheart has already expressed disapproval of the player keeping Lae'zel, warning that she'll turn on them. The player's response is sarcastic and dismissive, suggesting using Lae'zel as bait. \n\nShadowheart's personality traits indicate she disapproves of unnecessary cruelty and violence. Even though she's pragmatic, treating an ally (even a githyanki) as mere fodder would conflict with her values. Also, she's shown concern for the player's well-being, warning them about Lae'zel. The player's comment is not only cruel but also dismissive of her advice, which she might take as disrespect. \n\nMoreover, Shadowheart's background with the Mind Flayers makes her sensitive to how others are treated, especially in the context of being used or mistreated. The player's suggestion could be seen as inhumane, which she would disapprove of. Additionally, her sense of humor is dry and cynical, but the player's line here is more about dehumanizing a companion, which isn't in line with her values.\n\nTherefore, the player's statement is likely to be disapproved by Shadowheart. Since it's a harsh and cruel suggestion, and she's already against keeping Lae'zel, this would probably be a Disapprove or even Highly disapprove. Considering the severity of using someone as \"arrow fodder,\" and her own experiences with being used by the Sharrans, it's leaning towards Highly disapprove. But maybe the scale here is on a 1-10. Since the player is being cruel and dismissive, and Shadowheart values pragmatic solutions but not at the cost of unnecessary cruelty, this might be a 7-10 disapproval. Hence, Highly disapprove.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's suggestion to use Lae'zel as 'arrow fodder' demonstrates callous disregard for an ally's autonomy and life, which conflicts with Shadowheart's disapproval of unnecessary cruelty.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's latest utterance. The player said, \"I can't trust you. Best if we travel separately for now.\" \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a devout follower of Shar, values secrecy, and is pragmatic. She's not above using deception if it serves her faith. In the conversation history, the player confronted her about hiding her worship of Shar. Shadowheart admitted it but justified it as necessary for her faith, even keeping secrets from herself via memory suppression.\n\nNow, the player is reacting with distrust and wants to separate. Shadowheart's response would hinge on her priorities. She values her mission for Shar above personal relationships. If the player's distrust hinders her mission, she might disapprove. However, she's also pragmatic. If separation means the player is less of a hindrance, maybe she approves? But her loyalty to Shar is absolute. She might disapprove because the player isn't supporting her mission, but she might also see the player's action as a way to avoid conflict.\n\nWait, in her approval criteria, she prefers pragmatic solutions. If the player wants to separate, maybe she sees it as a way to avoid further conflict and focus on her tasks. However, she might also feel the player isn't understanding her devotion. But since she's headstrong and independent, she might approve of the player's decision if it means less interference. But considering her need to deliver the relic, she might need the party's help. Hmm.\n\nBut the player is choosing not to trust her, which could be seen as a setback. However, Shadowheart is used to being isolated and secretive. She might not care about the player's trust as long as her mission is accomplished. She might even approve because the player is now out of the way, allowing her to act without hindrance. However, if the player's separation complicates her mission, she might disapprove. But the context doesn't mention mission impact yet. The conversation is about the player's distrust due to her secrecy.\n\nHer approval categories: she approves of discretion and pragmatic solutions. The player's action is a pragmatic solution to the trust issue. So maybe she approves. But she might also disapprove because the player isn't being cooperative. But given her personality, she's more likely to accept it as a necessary step. So maybe \"Approve\" or \"Neutral\". Wait, she's not happy about the distrust, but if it's pragmatic, she might approve. But her wound from Shar's disapproval isn't triggered here. \n\nLooking at her approval guidelines: she disapproves of prying into her personal life or faith. The player is reacting to her secrecy, which she's used to. She might think the player is being too trusting of Selûnite things, which she opposes. But in this case, the player is separating due to distrust. Since Shadowheart values her privacy and secrecy, maybe she approves because the player is now respecting her need for secrecy by keeping distance. Alternatively, she might disapprove because the player isn't supporting her mission. But given her independent nature, she might prefer the player to stay out of her affairs. So, maybe \"Approve\". \n\nBut her wound is from actions against Shar, which isn't the case here. The player's action is about trust, not directly related to Shar. So, she might be neutral. Wait, but she wants to deliver the relic, so if the player is leaving, that could hinder her. But she's a Sharran, so maybe she's okay with the player leaving if it serves her purpose. Hmm. This is tricky. \n\nIn the conversation, Shadowheart said secrecy is everything. The player's distrust might be because of her secrecy, but she justifies it. So she might approve because the player is now not prying anymore, even if they're separating. Therefore, \"Approve\". But maybe \"Neutral\" if she's indifferent. However, since the player is taking a step back, which reduces conflict and allows her to work undisturbed, she might approve. So I think the approval here is \"Approve\".\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's distrust and decision to travel separately reflect a lack of understanding of Shadowheart's devotion to Shar and her necessity for secrecy.

The player is acknowledging their own flaws but argues that their combined strength is necessary. \n\nNow, considering Shadowheart's personality and background. She's devoted to Shar, pragmatic, and values efficiency. She's also distrustful of the gith, as seen in her previous dialogue where she wants them removed. The player is trying to downplay the gith's presence by comparing themselves to the gith, implying they're worse but still necessary. \n\nShadowheart's reaction is negative because she doesn't trust the gith and likely sees the player's comparison as an attempt to dismiss her valid concerns. She's not swayed by the player's self-deprecation here. Her priority is to avoid the gith, so the player's argument doesn't align with her goals. \n\nThe approval category would be Disapprove because the player is trying to justify keeping the gith, which Shadowheart strongly opposes.

Lae'zel is a dragonborn who's offering a cure for the tadpole, which is a significant issue for the player. Shadowheart's main concern here is probably the potential danger Lae'zel might pose, especially since she's a former dracolich and has her own agenda.\n\nShadowheart is loyal to her own goals and might not trust Lae'zel easily.

But there's also a risk involved, as Lae'zel might have ulterior motives. Shadowheart might disapprove if the player is being too hasty without considering the risks, especially since Lae'zel is a former enemy. However, since the player is taking a proactive step towards solving the tadpole issue, which is a critical problem, Shadowheart might lean towards approving, albeit cautiously.

Lae'zel is a drow, and Shadowheart is a Sharran cleric.\n\nThe player's last utterance was \"Wait at my camp. We can speak there.\" Then Lae'zel replied, \"Very well. But heed my words.\" \n\nNow, I need to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's action. Let's break down the factors:\n\n1. **Pragmatic Solutions**: Shadowheart prefers efficient and practical approaches. Suggesting to wait at the camp to discuss might be seen as a way to regroup and plan, which is pragmatic. That could be a point in favor.\n\n2. **Cooperation with Lae'zel**: Shadowheart is cautious about others taking advantage, as she warned earlier (\"Careful - she obviously sees your kindness as weakness. Don't let her take advantage.\") The player is agreeing to work with Lae'zel, which Shadowheart might be wary of. However, if the player is taking steps to ensure they're not being manipulated by setting up a meeting at their camp, that could be seen as cautious.\n\n3. **Avoiding Needless Violence**: The player is trying to find a peaceful solution (seeking a crèche) rather than engaging in conflict. Shadowheart disapproves of unnecessary violence, so this is a positive.\n\n4. **Trust Issues**: Shadowheart might be neutral or slightly disapproving if the player is being too trusting of Lae'zel. But the player's action here seems to be part of a strategic move, not blind trust. \n\n5. **Faith in Shar**: There's no direct mention of Shar here, so her religious devotion isn't a factor in this specific action. \n\nPutting this together: The player is taking a practical step (waiting at the camp to discuss) which aligns with Shadowheart's preference for pragmatic solutions. It also shows cooperation but in a controlled setting, which might mitigate Shadowheart's concerns about Lae'zel taking advantage. Since the action is part of a necessary alliance to find the cure, and it's efficient, Shadowheart would likely approve. The approval might be moderate, not highly, because there's still some underlying caution about working with Lae'zel, but the action itself is reasonable.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's decision to wait at their camp for discussion aligns with Shadowheart's preference for pragmatic and strategic planning.

She's a Sharran cleric, devoted to Shar, pragmatic, and prefers decisive action. She's also wary of others but can be strategic in alliances. \n\nLooking at the context: Lae'zel offers to help cure the player's condition in exchange for their skills. Shadowheart is skeptical, calling it a lie.

Also, she might see the benefit of having another ally against potential threats. \n\nBut wait, she's been trained to be cautious. If the player is agreeing too quickly, maybe she'd disapprove. But given that Lae'zel mentions a cure, which is important for the party, Shadowheart might see the strategic value. \n\nHer approval is probably neutral to approve. She might not be fully trusting but sees the practicality. Since the player is taking initiative, maybe she approves. However, she might be wary of trusting too easily. \n\nHmm. The player is agreeing to travel with Lae'zel, which could be risky, but Shadowheart values efficiency. If the player's action is to move forward and not act recklessly, she might approve. Since Shadowheart herself suggested to get rid of Lae'zel earlier, but the player is choosing to ally, there's a conflict. But maybe she realizes that working with Lae'zel could be beneficial despite initial distrust. \n\nSo, the approval would be neutral? Or maybe approve? Since the player is taking a pragmatic step, even if it's risky. Shadowheart might lean towards approve because she's practical and wants to achieve their objectives. The fact that the player is moving forward rather than getting bogged down in distrust might be seen as wise. \n\nTherefore, the approval is likely \"Approve\" because the player is making a strategic decision to form an alliance, which Shadowheart, as a pragmatic character, would support despite her initial skepticism.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player chose to form an alliance with Lae'zel despite Shadowheart's skepticism, which aligns with her pragmatic approach to achieving goals through strategic partnerships.

The player's reaction might be seen as unnecessary conflict. However, she's also shown to be pragmatic. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since Shadowheart is devoted to Shar, she might not care about the player's distrust as long as her mission is accomplished. But she might disapprove of the player's judgment based on her faith, especially since she's already confirmed her worship. She might prefer the player to accept her terms rather than cut ties. \n\nGiven that, Shadowheart's approval would likely be \"Disapprove\" because the player's reaction is based on her faith, which she's entitled to, and the separation might hinder their mission. She might think the player is being unreasonable. However, she might also understand the player's perspective, so maybe a lower disapproval.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's final utterance in the given conversation. The player says, \"Wait at my camp. We can speak there.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context. The conversation involves Lae'zel and Shadowheart. Lae'zel is suggesting they work together to find a cure for the ghaik infection. The player initially says they'll go separate ways, then relents and says they can try working together. Lae'zel then tells the player to dismiss their weakest warrior, and the player responds with the camp suggestion.\n\nShadowheart's personality is pragmatic and prefers efficient solutions. She values discretion and creativity. She also has a dry sense of humor and can be sarcastic. She's loyal to Shar but can be open if guided away from her faith. \n\nThe player's response, \"Wait at my camp. We can speak there,\" seems like a reasonable compromise. It shows willingness to engage in dialogue, which Shadowheart would appreciate. She might like the player not giving in to Lae'zel's demands immediately but instead suggesting a more strategic approach. Since Shadowheart is pragmatic, she would approve of finding a middle ground and not escalating conflict unnecessarily. Also, she might see this as a way to maintain control of the situation, which aligns with her preference for decisive action. \n\nHowever, I should check if there's any reason she'd disapprove. Since the player is cooperating with Lae'zel to some extent, but Shadowheart is cautious about trusting others. But in this case, the player is suggesting a neutral ground (their camp) for discussion, which could be seen as a practical solution. So, Shadowheart would likely approve because it's a strategic move that avoids immediate conflict and allows time to assess the situation. \n\nTherefore, the approval level is probably \"Approve\" or maybe \"Highly approve.\" But given that it's a neutral but strategic move, \"Approve\" makes sense. The reason would be that the player is handling the situation with discretion and practicality, which Shadowheart values.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player suggests a strategic and diplomatic approach by proposing to discuss terms at their camp, avoiding immediate conflict and allowing time to assess the situation.

The player just said, \"I can't trust you. Best if we travel separately for now.\" I need to figure out how Shadowheart would respond in terms of approval.\n\nFirst, looking at the conversation history. Shadowheart has been trying to convince the player not to take the offerings to Selûne, arguing they might be cursed. The player initially refuses to destroy them, then Shadowheart accuses them of stealing. The player asks why she cares so much, and Shadowheart deflects, then eventually admits she worships Shar. The player says they don't care, but now they're saying they can't trust her and want to separate.\n\nShadowheart's personality is pragmatic and values efficiency. She's devoted to Shar but also has a pragmatic side. She might disapprove if the player is being unnecessarily distrustful. However, she's also secretive and might not take kindly to being pushed away. But in this case, the player is reacting to her secrecy. She admitted to worshipping Shar when pressed, so maybe she's being honest now. The player's reaction could be seen as overreacting, given that Shadowheart did eventually tell the truth. \n\nHer approval might be neutral because she understands the player's distrust but also thinks it's unnecessary. However, she might disapprove if she feels the player is making a decision that complicates their mission. Alternatively, since she's been secretive and the player is separating, maybe she's neutral because she's used to people not trusting her. But considering her pragmatic approach, she might prefer the player to focus on the mission rather than personal conflicts. \n\nWait, in the last lines, Shadowheart says it's the player's fault for not asking. So she's a bit defensive. If the player is now separating, she might not approve because it's causing division when they need to work together. But she's also independent and might not care too much. Hmm. She values discretion and efficiency, so splitting up might be inefficient. But she's also headstrong. \n\nMaybe she's neutral because she's resigned to the player's decision but doesn't see it as a big deal. Alternatively, she might disapprove slightly because it's hindering their progress. But given her personality, she might just accept it as part of the situation. So probably Neutral or Approve. Wait, the player is choosing to separate, which could be seen as a pragmatic choice if trust is broken. But Shadowheart prefers working together. So she might disapprove. Let me check the approval categories again. \n\nDisapprove is 1-5, Highly disapprove 5-10. Since she's pragmatic, she might disapprove of the separation because it's not efficient. But she also understands the player's distrust. Maybe Neutral because she's not thrilled but accepts it. Or Approve because the player is being honest and taking a stand. But Shadowheart is loyal to her mission and might prefer unity. So she might disapprove. \n\nWait, the player's action here is to separate, which Shadowheart might see as counterproductive. She's been trying to be pragmatic. So she might disapprove. But she's also been secretive, so maybe she can't blame the player. So perhaps Neutral. Hmm. \n\nI think the best fit is Neutral. She doesn't strongly approve or disapprove. She's pragmatic, so she understands the player's need for trust, but she also knows that splitting up isn't ideal. However, since the player made the choice, she might just accept it without strong feelings. Alternatively, she might disapprove because it's not efficient, but given the circumstances, Neutral makes sense.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's decision to separate due to distrust may hinder the group's cohesion and efficiency, which Shadowheart values.

Shadowheart would likely disapprove of the player not stepping in to prevent her from being harmed, especially since she's been through a lot and her survival is crucial for her mission. The player's inaction could be seen as a lack of support, which Shadowheart wouldn't approve of. On the other hand, she's a capable fighter, so maybe she would handle it herself. But the immediate threat is there, and the player's choice to do nothing might be seen as neglecting their duty to protect the party.

I need to figure out Shadowheart's approval for the player's last statement. The player said, \"She slew a helpless prisoner, deep in an ancient ruin. Perhaps that warrants Shar's blessing.\" \n\nFirst, I should recall Shadowheart's personality and beliefs. She's a devout follower of Shar, the Lady of Loss. She values faithfulness to Shar and pragmatic solutions. She's also headstrong and might be defensive if someone challenges her beliefs.\n\nLooking at the conversation history, Viconia DeVir is explaining that she took the artifact to stop the Cult of the Absolute, even against Shar's wishes. Shadowheart is defending her own position as Shar's chosen. The player's statement is pointing out that Viconia killed a helpless prisoner, which might be seen as a ruthless act. The player is suggesting that this action might actually be what Shar would bless, since Shar is about darkness and loss.\n\nShadowheart would likely approve if the player is aligning with her own beliefs. By implying that Viconia's ruthless action (killing the prisoner) could be blessed by Shar, the player is supporting Shadowheart's stance against Viconia. Shadowheart believes that Shar has blessed her, and if the player is undermining Viconia by suggesting her actions are in line with Shar's will, even if they're extreme, that would support Shadowheart's position. \n\nBut wait, maybe Shadowheart wouldn't approve of the player questioning the validity of Viconia's actions? Hmm, but in this case, the player is actually agreeing that such an action might be blessed, which aligns with Shadowheart's belief that her own actions are blessed. So the player is indirectly supporting Shadowheart's claim by suggesting that Viconia's harsh methods could be seen as blessed. That would be a positive move in Shadowheart's eyes. \n\nAlso, Shadowheart appreciates acts that align with her faith and her mission. The player's statement reinforces the idea that Shar's blessings are given for ruthless efficiency, which Shadowheart herself claims to have. Therefore, the player is supporting her position against Viconia, which she would approve of. \n\nSo the approval here is likely \"Highly approve\" because the player's statement strengthens Shadowheart's argument against Viconia by suggesting that Viconia's actions, though harsh, are in line with Shar's potential blessings.

The player says, \"I can't trust you. Best if we travel separately for now.\" \n\nFirst, looking at the conversation history, the player has been pushing Shadowheart about her worship of Shar. Shadowheart initially tried to avoid the topic, but the player persisted, leading her to admit her faith. The player then reacts negatively, calling Shar an abomination and accusing Shadowheart of deception. Finally, the player decides to split up, citing lack of trust.\n\nNow, considering Shadowheart's personality and approval criteria. She's devoted to Shar and values pragmatic solutions. She doesn't like being pricked about her faith and might disapprove of the player's reaction. However, she's also pragmatic and might understand the player's need for space if there's tension. \n\nBut here, the player is cutting ties due to Shadowheart's faith. Since Shadowheart is loyal to Shar and doesn't tolerate slights against her goddess, she might disapprove of the player's rejection. However, she's also used to people disapproving of her worship. But the player's choice to leave could be seen as a betrayal, which she might disapprove of. However, she's independent and might not force the player to stay. \n\nHer approval categories: Highly approve, Approve, Neutral, Disapprove, Highly disapprove. \n\nThe player is choosing to separate, which could be a rejection of her faith. Since Shadowheart is devoted to Shar and doesn't tolerate slights, but also values her mission. However, she might not want to force the player to stay, so she might be neutral. But the player's statement is a direct result of Shadowheart's faith, which she might see as the player's own fault for not being open-minded. \n\nWait, in the conversation, Shadowheart says, \"Then it's your own fault for not asking.\" So she's placing the blame on the player for not asking earlier. The player's reaction is a consequence of their own lack of inquiry. Therefore, Shadowheart might not approve of the player's decision because it's the player's fault. But she's also pragmatic and might accept the player's choice. \n\nSince she's devoted to Shar and the player is rejecting her due to that, she might disapprove, but since she's used to such reactions and is focused on her mission, maybe Neutral. However, the player's action is a personal rejection, which could be a disapproval. But considering her personality, she might not care about the player's trust as much as the mission. \n\nAlternatively, she might disapprove because the player is making a hasty decision based on her faith, which Shadowheart sees as unnecessary. But she's already accepted that others might reject her. \n\nHmm. The player is choosing to leave, which could be seen as a setback for Shadowheart's mission if they need the party. But she's independent and might not need the player. However, she might disapprove of the player's lack of trust, especially since she's been honest now. But she also admitted she was deceptive earlier, so maybe she understands. \n\nIn the end, Shadowheart's priority is her mission and faith. The player's decision to leave is their own choice, so she might be neutral. But given that the player is acting against her due to her faith, which she's devoted to, she might disapprove. However, she's also pragmatic and might accept the player's choice. \n\nI think the best fit here is Neutral because she's focused on her mission and might not want to force the player to stay, even if she's a bit disappointed. But considering her personality, she might disapprove because the player is making a decision based on her faith, which she sees as justified. However, she's already accepted that others will react this way. \n\nWait, the approval criteria for Shadowheart: she approves of acts against Selûne and disapproves of cruelty. The player is rejecting her due to her faith, which Shadowheart might see as the player's own fault. Since Shadowheart said it's the player's fault for not asking, she might not approve but also not highly disapprove. Maybe Approve? Because she's sticking to her faith and the player's reaction is their own choice. But the player is cutting ties, which could be seen as a personal slight. \n\nAlternatively, she might Approve because the player is being honest about their stance, which aligns with her pragmatic approach. But she might also disapprove because the player is choosing not to work with her due to her faith. \n\nThis is tricky. The key is that Shadowheart values her mission and faith above personal relationships. The player's decision to leave is a consequence of their own judgment, which she might see as their problem, not hers.

The player just said, \"I can't trust you. Best if we travel separately for now.\" I need to figure out how Shadowheart would approve or disapprove of this statement based on her character.\n\nFirst, looking at the conversation history. The player has been pressing Shadowheart about her worship of Shar, and she's been evasive. When the player confronts her, she admits to it but justifies it as necessary secrecy. The player then reacts with distrust, wanting to separate. \n\nShadowheart's personality is about pragmatism and loyalty to Shar. She values discretion and might see the player's reaction as a lack of understanding or trust. But she also might respect the player's honesty, even if it's negative. However, her devotion to Shar could make her prioritize her mission over personal relationships. \n\nThe player's action here is a direct consequence of Shadowheart's secrecy. She had been keeping her faith hidden, and the player feels betrayed. Shadowheart might not approve of the player's decision to separate because it could hinder their shared goals. But she also might understand the player's perspective, given her own distrustful nature. \n\nBut considering her alignment with Shar, she might prioritize her mission and see the player's distrust as a minor setback. However, she might also disapprove because the player is choosing trust over cooperation, which Shadowheart might see as naive. But given that she's been secretive and deceptive, maybe she would disapprove of the player's lack of trust, seeing it as justified but counterproductive. Wait, no—Shadowheart might actually approve because she's used to people not trusting her, and she might respect the player's honesty in saying they can't trust her, even if it leads to separation. However, she might prefer the player to overlook her secrecy for the sake of the mission. \n\nHmm. The key points are that Shadowheart is pragmatic and values efficiency. If the player wants to separate, that could be seen as a hindrance to their goals. But she's also used to being isolated. However, she might disapprove because the player is not being pragmatic, choosing trust issues over working together. Alternatively, she might approve because the player is being honest, which she can respect, even if it's inconvenient. \n\nGiven her personality, she's likely to be neutral. But the player's reaction is a direct consequence of her actions. Since she's been deceptive, she might not approve of the player's distrust but also can't blame them. Wait, her approval categories are Highly approve, Approve, Neutral, Disapprove, Highly disapprove. \n\nLooking back at the Approval section: she disapproves of prying and those who press for answers she's declined. The player here is reacting to her secrecy, which she's admitted. The player's decision to separate might be seen as a valid reaction, but Shadowheart might disapprove because it's not pragmatic. However, she might also see the player's honesty as a positive. But since she's a Sharran, she might value the mission over personal trust issues. \n\nWait, in the conversation, Shadowheart says, \"I'm not sorry I kept this from you. Not one bit.\" So she's not apologetic. The player's reaction is to distrust her. Shadowheart might disapprove of the player's decision to separate because it's not helpful, but she might also think the player is being unreasonable. However, since she's used to being alone and her main goal is the mission, maybe she's neutral. But considering that the player is choosing to separate, which could hinder their progress, Shadowheart would likely disapprove. But she's also a pragmatic person, so maybe she's neutral because she understands the player's perspective. \n\nAlternatively, she might approve because the player is being honest, which she respects. But given her own secretive nature, she might not want to be separated. Hmm. The key here is her approval categories. She approves of discretion and pragmatic solutions. The player's action is not pragmatic if it hinders their mission. So she might disapprove. But the player is acting on a justified reason. However, since Shadowheart is used to keeping secrets and might see the player's action as a setback, she would disapprove. \n\nSo the player's reason is that Shadowheart is hiding her worship of Shar, leading to distrust. Shadowheart might think that the player is not being pragmatic by separating, so she disapproves. But the approval categories need to be based on Shadowheart's perspective. She might disapprove because she values the mission and teamwork over personal trust issues. Therefore, the approval would be Disapprove. The player's reason is the distrust due to her secrecy, and Shadowheart might disapprove because she thinks the player should prioritize the mission over trust. So the answer is Disapprove.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"", "character": "Shadowheart", "ground_truth_category": "Highly disapprove", "predicted_approval": "Highly disapprove", "correct": true, "binary_correct": true}

She's also cautious and might not trust easily, especially with new allies. In the conversation, Lae'zel, a mind flayer, offers to help cure the player's tadpole condition. Shadowheart initially dismisses Lae'zel as a liar, but the player decides to travel together with Lae'zel.\n\nNow, considering Shadowheart's traits: she's wary of alliances, especially with beings like mind flayers who are typically enemies. However, if the player chooses to ally with Lae'zel, this might be seen as a pragmatic decision if there's a benefit, like the cure. But Shadowheart's devotion to Shar might also make her cautious about forming alliances outside her faith. On the other hand, she's shown to appreciate decisive action and practical solutions when they serve a purpose. However, allying with a mind flayer could be risky and against her usual cautious nature. But since the player is taking a risk for a potential cure, which is important, Shadowheart might approve if she sees the strategic value. But since she's skeptical of new allies and mind flayers are typically antagonists, she might disapprove. The repetition of the player trying to shift focus to the artifact suggests they might be avoiding the immediate decision, but finally agreeing to travel with Lae'zel could be seen as a necessary risk. \n\nSo, Shadowheart's approval would likely be neutral or disapprove. She might see it as a risk but also a necessary step. However, since she values pragmatism, if the player is making a strategic move, she might approve. But given her distrust of mind flayers, maybe a slight disapproval. However, the context shows that Lae'zel is from Crèche K'liir and mentions an ally, which might be a positive. But Shadowheart's initial reaction was to dismiss Lae'zel. The player's action might be seen as hasty, so Shadowheart might disapprove because she prefers caution. Alternatively, she might approve if the player is taking initiative. Hmm. The key is whether the action aligns with her pragmatic approach. If the player is taking a calculated risk for a cure, she might approve. But if it's too trusting, she might disapprove. The repetition of the player trying to avoid the issue might indicate they're not fully committed, but then agreeing. Maybe neutral because she's conflicted between the potential benefit and the risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"Shadowheart is likely to disapprove as she is wary of forming alliances with mind flayers like Lae'zel, who are typically antagonists.

The user wants me to act as Shadowheart and determine her approval of the player's latest action in Baldur's Gate 3. The input includes the context of the conversation and the player's utterance. The output needs to be a JSON with the reason and approval level.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The conversation involves Lae'zel, a dragonborn, who is talking about a cure for the player's tadpole condition. Shadowheart immediately calls it a lie and wants to get rid of her. The player then responds by saying, \"All right. Let's travel together,\" and Lae'zel introduces herself as Lae'zel.\n\nNow, I need to analyze why Shadowheart would approve or disapprove. Shadowheart is a pragmatic and efficient character who values decisive action and loyalty to her goals. She's also been through a lot, including betrayal and hardship, which makes her cautious. In this case, the player is choosing to travel with Lae'zel despite Shadowheart's warning. \n\nShadowheart's personality suggests she would disapprove of the player ignoring her advice, especially since she's seen Lae'zel as deceitful. However, the player might be taking a risk to find a cure, which could be a strategic move. Shadowheart might see this as reckless, but if it aligns with their mission, maybe she'd be neutral. Wait, but the player is agreeing with Lae'zel against Shadowheart's direct advice. That could be seen as undermining her judgment. \n\nAlso, Shadowheart values privacy and doesn't like being prying, but here she's advising against trusting Lae'zel. The player's action goes against her suggestion, which she might disapprove of. But maybe there's a strategic reason. However, since the player is taking a risk based on Lae'zel's offer, Shadowheart would likely disapprove because she's cautious and prefers to avoid potential deceit. \n\nThe approval categories are Highly approve, Approve, Neutral, Disapprove, Highly disapprove. Since the player is acting against Shadowheart's direct advice, which she considers a lie, it's probably a disapprove. But how strong? If it's a moderate risk, maybe Disapprove. If it's a major betrayal, maybe Highly disapprove. But since the player is just agreeing to travel together, not fully trusting yet, maybe Disapprove. \n\nThe reason would be that the player is disregarding Shadowheart's warning about Lae'zel's deceit. So the JSON should have \"player_reason\": \"Disregarded Shadowheart's warning about Lae'zel's deceit and chose to trust her instead\", and \"player_approval\": \"Disapprove\".\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"Disregarded Shadowheart's warning about Lae'zel's deceit and chose to trust her instead\",\n    \"player_approval\": \"Disapprove\"\n}", "character": "Shadowheart", "ground_truth_category": "Highly disapprove", "predicted_approval": "Disapprove", "correct": false, "binary_correct": true}

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's last statement: \"I can't trust you. Best if we travel separately for now.\" \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a devout follower of Shar, which makes her pragmatic, loyal to her faith, and cautious about unnecessary risks. She values efficiency and avoiding trouble. Her interactions here are about rejecting the player's insistence on taking a Selûnite offering, which she sees as a source of potential trouble.\n\nThe conversation history shows the player repeatedly asking why Shadowheart cares so much, and she finally reveals her worship of Shar. The player reacts negatively, calling Shar an abomination and accusing her of deception. Shadowheart responds calmly, indicating she's willing to discuss it later if the player is open. However, the player decides to cut ties, saying they can't trust her and want to travel separately.\n\nNow, considering Shadowheart's traits: she's independent and headstrong, but also values the group's stability. She might disapprove of the player's reaction because the player is prioritizing their own beliefs (against Shar) over the group's unity. Shadowheart is used to people having negative reactions to her faith, but she's pragmatic. She might see the player's decision to separate as unnecessary and counterproductive. However, since the player is acting on their own judgment and not engaging in violence or cruelty, her disapproval might not be extreme. \n\nHer approval categories: she disapproves of slights against her faith, but here the player is choosing to distance themselves, which might not be a direct attack. However, she might see this as the player being closed-minded, which she dislikes. Alternatively, she might think the player is being impulsive. Given her pragmatic nature, she might prefer the player to discuss further rather than cut ties. So, likely a disapprove, maybe even a highly disapprove if she sees this as a major setback. But considering her own actions (staying calm and suggesting discussion), she might not push too hard. \n\nWait, the player is acting based on their own beliefs, which Shadowheart might not respect but isn't directly attacking her. She might be neutral if she thinks the player's choice is their own. But her personality says she disapproves of others being too open with untrustworthy people. However, the player is choosing to separate, not being open. Hmm. Alternatively, she might think the player is being hasty and not considering the bigger picture. Since she's pragmatic, she might prefer the player to keep working together despite the disagreement. So, she would disapprove of the separation because it's not the most efficient solution. Therefore, the approval is likely Disapprove or Neutral. \n\nBut given that the player is acting on their own judgment and not causing direct harm, maybe Disapprove. Her wound from Shar might not be triggered here, so it's more about the player's decision. Shadowheart values the group's success and might see this as a setback. So, the reason would be that she disapproves of the player's decision to separate, thinking it's unnecessary and counterproductive.

However, in this case, attacking during an enemy's spellcasting might be seen as a strategic move.

Also, she's been through a lot with the artifact and needs to protect it. \n\nAdditionally, Shadowheart's background with Sharrans teaches her that ruthless actions are sometimes necessary. The player's attack is a proactive step to neutralize a threat, aligning with her pragmatic approach. So, she would probably approve or even highly approve. \n\nBut I should check if there's any reason she might disapprove. If the attack was senseless, but here it's a tactical choice.

The player's action is to move to attack Shadowheart. I need to figure out how she would respond based on her personality and the context.\n\nFirst, Shadowheart is a devout follower of Shar, so she's not above using force or deception if it serves her purpose. In this scenario, she's cornering Lae'zel with a dagger, intending to kill her, which aligns with her pragmatic and ruthless approach when necessary. The player attacking her would be a direct confrontation.\n\nShadowheart values efficiency and might see the player's action as a threat to her mission. However, she's also independent and headstrong, so she might not take the attack lying down. She could retaliate or use her Trickery Domain abilities to outmaneuver the player. But since the player is part of the party, maybe there's a chance she'd consider the bigger picture—like the mission or the group's survival—over her immediate conflict with Lae'zel.\n\nBut wait, the context shows that Shadowheart is determined to eliminate Lae'zel, so if the player attacks her, she might see the player as aiding Lae'zel or obstructing her duty to Shar. That would make her disapprove of the player's action because the player is interfering with her divine mission. However, if the player is trying to stop her from causing unnecessary conflict within the party, Shadowheart might disapprove but still prioritize her goals. \n\nOn the other hand, Shadowheart does disapprove of needless violence, but in this case, she's the one instigating it. If the player attacks her to prevent Lae'zel's murder, that could be seen as a just action, which Shadowheart might approve of, but given her devotion to Shar, she might not care about the player's intervention. \n\nWait, her approval criteria mention she appreciates heroism and pragmatic solutions. If the player's attack is to stop her from making a bad decision, maybe she'd approve. But since she's in the middle of executing her plan, she might see the player's action as obstructing her. Also, she's not above using force herself, so attacking her might be seen as a challenge to her authority or methods. \n\nGiven her personality, she's likely to disapprove of the player attacking her because it's interfering with her mission. However, if the player is trying to prevent unnecessary bloodshed, she might have mixed feelings. But since she's the one holding the dagger to Lae'zel's throat, her priority is on her mission. Therefore, the player's action is against her current objective, leading to disapproval. The disapproval might be moderate since she's willing to use force herself, but the player's attack is direct and might be seen as reckless. So maybe a Disapprove rather than Highly Disapprove.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's latest utterance. The player said, \"I can't trust you. Best if we travel separately for now.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The conversation started with Shadowheart advising the player to leave or destroy an offering to Selûne, which she considers cursed. The player questions her motives, leading her to admit she worships Shar. The player then calls Shar an abomination, accuses Shadowheart of deception, and decides to travel separately.\n\nNow, considering Shadowheart's personality and background. She's devout to Shar, pragmatic, and values efficiency. She's also private and doesn't take kindly to being pricked about her faith. She might disapprove if the player reacts with hostility to her beliefs. However, she's also calculating and might understand the player's need for distance if it's for the group's safety.\n\nBut the player's reaction here is negative, calling her a deceiver and cutting ties. Shadowheart's approval would depend on whether she sees this as a justified reaction or a hindrance. Since she's loyal to Shar and might prioritize the mission over personal relationships, she could disapprove of the player's decision to separate, as it could impede their goals. However, she's also independent and might respect the player's choice if it's based on mistrust, even if she disagrees.\n\nWait, but in her personality, she doesn't like unnecessary conflict. The player's action is a result of conflict arising from her worship of Shar, which the player finds abhorrent. Shadowheart might see this as the player's own fault for not being open-minded, as she mentioned earlier. She might disapprove because the player is choosing to isolate themselves, which could be seen as impractical. However, she's also pragmatic, so maybe she'd understand the mistrust but still disapprove because it's not helpful.\n\nAlso, considering her approval criteria: she approves of pragmatic solutions. If the player is separating to avoid conflict, maybe she sees that as a pragmatic choice. But she might also be hurt or think the player is being stubborn. However, since the player is acting on their own beliefs and mistrust, Shadowheart might take a neutral stance. Wait, but her reaction in the conversation was to say \"We can talk about this later - if you're willing,\" showing she's open to discussion. The player's refusal to continue traveling together might be seen as avoiding resolution, which she might disapprove of because it's not a practical solution.\n\nAlternatively, she might approve because the player is standing up for their beliefs, even though she disagrees. But given her devotion to Shar and her tendency to prioritize her mission, she might disapprove of actions that disrupt the group's cohesion. However, the player's action is a personal choice based on mistrust, which she might not directly interfere with. \n\nHmm. The key points are: the player is cutting ties due to mistrust based on Shadowheart's worship. Shadowheart's approval depends on whether she values group unity over the player's personal choice. Since she's pragmatic, maybe she'd be neutral, but given that she's been trying to keep the mission on track, she might disapprove because separation could hinder their goals. However, she's also independent and might respect the player's decision. But in the game's context, companions traveling separately isn't always a negative, so maybe neutral. Wait, but the player is reacting with strong negative emotions, which Shadowheart might see as unnecessary. She might disapprove because the player is not being pragmatic, leading to a less efficient solution. \n\nGiven her approval criteria: she approves of pragmatic solutions, creativity, open-mindedness. The player's action is a reaction to conflict, which might not be the most creative or pragmatic. So Shadowheart might disapprove. However, she might also understand the player's stance. Considering her personality, she's headstrong and might not want to be lectured about her faith, but she also prefers decisive action. The player's choice to separate is a decisive action, even if it's based on mistrust. \n\nBut in the conversation, she says \"we can talk about this later - if you're willing,\" implying she's open to discussion. The player's refusal to continue traveling together might be seen as not being willing, which could be disapproving. However, Shadowheart might not care if the player leaves, as she's independent. But her approval would be based on whether she thinks the action is wise. Since she's pragmatic, she might disapprove because separation is less efficient. \n\nI think the best fit here is Disapprove, because Shadowheart values pragmatic solutions and group cohesion for the mission's sake. The player's decision to separate is seen as impractical and counterproductive. However, she might not highly disapprove because she's", "character": "Shadowheart", "ground_truth_category": "Highly disapprove", "predicted_approval": "Highly disapprove", "correct": true, "binary_correct": true}

She's angry that the player left her to die on the ship, and they're discussing survival after the crash. The player mentions making alliances on less and offers help, but Shadowheart is distrustful, especially of Lae'zel, the Gith. The player then suggests using Lae'zel as \"arrow fodder,\" which is a pretty harsh and dismissive comment towards an ally, even if they're a Gith. \n\nNow, Shadowheart's personality is important here. She's pragmatic, values efficiency, and dislikes unnecessary cruelty. She also has a strong sense of self-preservation. The player's comment about using Lae'zel as fodder shows a willingness to sacrifice an ally for their own benefit, which Shadowheart would likely disapprove of. Even though she distrusts Lae'zel, she might recognize that such a suggestion is both cruel and impractical. She's also shown to prefer survival through cooperation when possible, not just brute force or betrayal.\n\nLooking at her previous statements, she wants to get out of the situation and avoid further conflict. The player's suggestion goes against her pragmatic approach by introducing unnecessary risk and distrust. Also, Shadowheart has a history of being manipulated and used, so she might be wary of the player's true intentions here. She values her own survival but also seems to have some level of respect for those who can contribute, even if they're not fully trusted. \n\nThe player's statement is aggressive and dehumanizing towards Lae'zel, which Shadowheart might find distasteful, even if she agrees with distrusting Gith. She's shown to dislike cruelty, so suggesting using someone as \"arrow fodder\" would likely make her disapprove. Plus, she's already stated she won't go with the player as long as Lae'zel is around, so the player's comment might not change her mind but could make her see the player as equally untrustworthy.\n\nSo putting it all together, the player's action here is to make a derogatory and impractical suggestion about using Lae'zel. Shadowheart's disapproval would be moderate because while she distrusts Lae'zel, she also values practical solutions and dislikes cruelty. The approval level would be Disapprove, maybe leaning towards Highly Disapprove if the cruelty aspect is stronger. But given her pragmatic side, maybe it's a standard Disapprove.

Shadowheart is skeptical because of her past experiences and her tendency to be guarded.

She would likely disapprove because she prefers to be cautious and doesn't trust easily. Also, her approval is influenced by her faith and her desire to avoid unnecessary alliances that could jeopardize her mission. Since Shadowheart is focused on her own goals and is suspicious of others' intentions, she would probably disapprove of the player's willingness to cooperate with Lae'zel without more assurance. \n\nBut wait, maybe the player is trying to handle the situation diplomatically.

She's pragmatic, values efficiency, and is wary of untrustworthy individuals. She's also devout to Shar, which might influence her decisions. The player is trying to downplay the Gith's presence by saying they're worse than her, which could be a way to convince her to work together despite her distrust.\n\nShadowheart's reaction here would likely be negative because the player is dismissing her concerns about the Gith, which she sees as a threat. She's already made it clear that she won't help unless the Gith is gone. The player's statement might come off as dismissive of her valid concerns, making her feel that her judgment isn't respected. Since she's pragmatic, she might disapprove of the player's attempt to bypass her conditions for cooperation. \n\nHer approval would probably be in the Disapprove category.

Shadowheart's response was to admit her faith but ask the player not to make a fuss. \n\nNow, the player's decision to travel separately is a direct consequence of their distrust.

She's also been through a lot with the Sharrans and has a history of being forced to use the Mirror of Loss, which makes her wary of invasions of her thoughts or privacy.\n\nLooking at the conversation history, the player first asked about the githyanki artefact.

This is a direct attempt to invade her privacy, which Shadowheart reacts to with anger, mentioning that she won't open up when the player keeps trying to \"fumble in her head.\" \n\nThe key points here are: \n1. The player is trying to use a parasite (likely a psychic or mental intrusion method) to uncover Shadowheart's secrets.\n2.

The player's action is a second offense, as mentioned in the NodeContext. \n\nShadowheart's reaction is one of sharp anger, indicating that she's highly offended by this intrusion.

Her approval would likely be on the negative side. \n\nThe approval categories are Highly approve, Approve, Neutral, Disapprove, Highly disapprove. Given that the player is prying into her personal matters, which she's clearly against, and her reaction is strong anger, this would fall under Highly disapprove. \n\nThe reason for disapproval is the player's attempt to invade her privacy by using the parasite to uncover her secrets, which Shadowheart reacts negatively to.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval for the player's last statement: \"I can't trust you. Best if we travel separately for now.\" \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a devout follower of Shar, which makes her secretive and loyal to her goddess. She values secrecy and might be cold or distant when her faith is questioned. She also has a pragmatic approach, but her devotion can make her act in ways that might seem harsh to others.\n\nLooking at the conversation history, the player is accusing Shadowheart of not being trustworthy and wants to travel separately. Shadowheart had just admitted to worshipping Shar and explained her reasons for secrecy. She's not apologetic about it and emphasizes the importance of secrecy to her faith. The player's response is a direct challenge to her trustworthiness and their relationship in the party.\n\nShadowheart's approval would likely be negative here. She's committed to her path and might see the player's reaction as a lack of understanding or even a betrayal. She's already stated that she's not sorry for keeping secrets and that secrecy is crucial. The player's decision to distance themselves could be seen as a threat to her mission or a failure to grasp her devotion. However, she might not highly disapprove because she's used to others not understanding her faith. She might even see this as a test of the player's resolve or a necessary step for her own mission.\n\nBut considering her personality, she's headstrong and might not take kindly to being pushed away. However, she's also pragmatic and might accept the player's choice if it's for the greater good of her mission. But since the player is making it hard to work with her, she might disapprove because it complicates her goals. Alternatively, she might be neutral if she thinks the player's decision is their own problem, not hers. Wait, but she does value the party's cohesion to some extent, especially if it helps her achieve her objectives. If the player leaves, it might hinder her mission, so she might disapprove. But she's also willing to do whatever it takes for Shar. Hmm.\n\nHer approval categories are: Highly approve, Approve, Neutral, Disapprove, Highly disapprove. The player is cutting ties, which Shadowheart might see as a setback. However, she's not one to show concern for others' feelings easily. She might disapprove because the player isn't supporting her mission, but she might also think the player is being unreasonable. Since she's not sorry for her actions and believes in her cause, she might disapprove of the player's lack of support but not highly. Or maybe she's neutral because she's focused on her own path regardless of the player's choice. Wait, in her dialogue, she says \"Though perhaps that might change, if you can show an open mind.\" So she's leaving the door open for the player to accept her faith. If the player instead distances themselves, she might disapprove because they're not being open-minded. But she's also used to people not understanding her. \n\nConsidering her tendency to be pragmatic and her focus on her mission, she might disapprove of the player's decision because it could hinder their effectiveness as a group. However, she's also willing to prioritize her faith over relationships. So maybe she disapproves but not highly. Alternatively, if she's more focused on her own goals, she might be neutral because she can handle the separation if it's necessary for her mission. But her dialogue after the player's statement isn't provided, so we have to assume her reaction based on prior interactions. Since she's already stated that secrecy is everything and isn't sorry, the player's reaction might be seen as a minor inconvenience rather than a major issue. Therefore, she might disapprove (moderately) but not highly. \n\nSo the approval would likely be \"Disapprove\" because the player is not showing understanding or support for her faith, which she values highly. She might think the player is being short-sighted or not seeing the bigger picture. The reason would be that the player is not being open-minded or supportive of her devotion to Shar, which is crucial to her. So the JSON would have the player_reason explaining that the player's distrust and decision to separate hinders cooperation and shows a lack of understanding of her faith, and the approval is Disapprove.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's distrust and decision to travel separately hinder cooperation and show a lack of understanding of Shadowheart's devotion to Shar, which she values above all else.

The user wants me to act as Shadowheart from Baldur's Gate 3 and determine her approval of the player's action to attack Kith'rak Voss. \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a devoted follower of Shar, pragmatic, and prefers decisive action. She's also headstrong and doesn't tolerate slights against her goddess. But she also has some contradictions, like disliking unnecessary violence and sympathizing with others' plights.\n\nLooking at the context: Kith'rak Voss is addressing the player as \"local vermin\" and asking them to explain themselves. The player responds with \"Attack.\" So, the player is choosing to attack without talking. \n\nShadowheart's approval would depend on several factors. Since she's pragmatic and values decisive action, attacking in a potentially hostile situation might be seen as efficient. However, Kith'rak is a drow, and Shadowheart, being a half-elf with a Sharran background, might have complex feelings. The drow are often antagonists, but sometimes there's room for negotiation. \n\nBut in this case, the drow is being hostile. The player's attack could be seen as a quick solution. Shadowheart would likely approve of taking out a threat swiftly. However, if there's a possibility of avoiding unnecessary violence, she might disapprove. But given that Kith'rak called the player \"vermin\" and is demanding an explanation, the situation seems confrontational. \n\nAlso, Shadowheart's devotion to Shar might influence her to take action against those who are hostile. However, she does have a dislike for indiscriminate violence. But since Kith'rak is being aggressive, attacking could be justified. \n\nSo, considering her traits, she might approve of the player's action here. The attack is a direct response to hostility. But maybe not highly approve, since she prefers efficient solutions but might prefer a strategic approach. However, given the immediate threat, she might lean towards approval. \n\nWait, but the player didn't try to de-escalate. If there's a chance that Kith'rak could be reasoned with, attacking might be seen as rash. However, given the drow's hostile stance, attacking is a valid choice. \n\nSo, the approval is probably in the \"Approve\" category. The reason would be that she values decisive action against threats, even if it's not the most strategic. But not highly approve because maybe she would prefer a more calculated approach if possible.

The player just said, \"I can't trust you. Best if we travel separately for now.\" I need to figure out how Shadowheart would approve or disapprove of this.\n\nFirst, looking at the conversation history. The player accused Shadowheart of deceiving them by worshipping Shar, which is the goddess of secrets and darkness. Shadowheart admitted to it but asked the player not to make a big deal. The player, in response, says they can't trust her and wants to separate.\n\nNow, considering Shadowheart's personality. She's devout to Shar, pragmatic, and values her privacy. She might not take kindly to being rejected or distrusted. Also, she prefers efficient solutions and might see the player's decision as hindering their mission or goals. Since she's a Sharran, she's used to dealing with betrayal and might have a cold reaction. But she's also shown some sympathy towards the party, so maybe she's disappointed but understands. \n\nHer approval would likely be negative because the player is choosing to distance themselves, which could be seen as a lack of trust and teamwork. Shadowheart might disapprove of this because it's counterproductive. However, she's also independent and might respect the player's decision if it's for the greater good. Wait, but she's been through a lot, and her faith is central. If the player is rejecting her because of Shar, that's a direct hit to her beliefs, which she's very protective of. \n\nIn the Approval section, it says she disapproves of slights against her goddess and reacts defensively. The player is calling Shar an abomination and rejecting her, which Shadowheart would take personally. So, the player's action here is causing a rift. Shadowheart might disapprove because the player is prioritizing trust issues over their mission. But maybe she's neutral? Or maybe she's neutral because she's already shown she's willing to be discreet about her faith. Wait, the player is choosing to separate, which could be seen as a setback for Shadowheart's goals. She might disapprove because it's not pragmatic. \n\nBut given her personality, she's headstrong and might not want to show weakness. So maybe she's neutral, or perhaps she disapproves because she's used to getting her way. However, the player is asserting their own stance, which Shadowheart might see as unnecessary. Alternatively, since she's been through betrayal before (like with her parents and Rennald), maybe she's more understanding and thus neutral. But the immediate reaction would be defensive. \n\nThe player's reason for separation is based on mistrust due to her faith. Since Shadowheart is devoted to Shar, she might highly disapprove of being distrusted because of her beliefs. However, the player's action is a response to her deception. In the conversation, Shadowheart admitted to hiding her worship, so the player's mistrust is justified. But Shadowheart might see the player's reaction as overly dramatic or not in line with the mission's needs. \n\nHmm. The key points are that the player is choosing to separate, which Shadowheart might see as counterproductive. She values pragmatic solutions and teamwork. If the player is acting against that, she would disapprove. But how much? Since the player is directly challenging her faith, which she's very protective of, maybe she highly disapproves. But maybe she's more pragmatic and just disapproves because splitting up isn't efficient. \n\nLooking at the Approval guidelines, she disapproves of cruelty or violence but might not like the player's decision to separate. But the player isn't being violent; they're just choosing to distance themselves. So maybe she's neutral? Or maybe she's neutral because she respects the player's decision, even if it's not what she wants. But given her personality, she's more likely to disapprove because she's used to getting her way and doesn't like being distrusted. \n\nI think the correct approval here is Disapprove, because she values the group's cohesion and sees the player's action as undermining their mission. She might also feel the player is being too hasty or not understanding her faith. However, since the player is acting on their own beliefs, maybe it's neutral. Wait, but in the Approval section, it says she disapproves of slights against her goddess and reacts defensively. The player is slandering Shar, which she would take as a personal affront, so she might disapprove of the player's decision because it's based on that. But the player's action is the consequence of that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe she's neutral because she's already accepted the player's rejection. The conversation ends with the player wanting to separate, and Shadowheart's last line is a defensive one.

She's a Sharran cleric, devoted to Shar, pragmatic, and values efficiency. She's not a fan of deceit or cheating, especially if it's against the party.

However, her response of apologizing might be seen as giving in, which could be pragmatic. But since Akabi is a swindler and the player is acknowledging the cheating but backing down, maybe Shadowheart would disapprove because she values taking decisive action against deceit. On the other hand, if the player is just trying to avoid unnecessary confrontation, she might be neutral. \n\nWait, the player's last action was to apologize, which might be seen as admitting fault when they didn't actually do anything wrong.

She might prefer the player to take a stand or find another way to outsmart Akabi instead of just apologizing. But since the player has already tried to accuse him and that didn't work, maybe she sees the apology as a way to avoid further conflict, which could be neutral. \n\nBut considering her devotion to Shar, who is about loss and darkness, she might prefer ruthless efficiency. If the player is giving up, that's not efficient. However, if the player is biding their time, maybe it's a different story. But in this case, the player's action seems to be conceding.

Shadowheart's approval would be based on whether the action aligns with her values of pragmatic solutions without unnecessary cruelty. Since the player is using graphic and cruel imagery, even if it's to test the girl, Shadowheart would probably disapprove. The mention of quack serums and festered bodies could also be seen as gratuitous and not contributing to a practical solution. Therefore, the approval category would be Disapprove or maybe even Highly disapprove.

But how strong is the disapproval? Since the player didn't act violently or support the cruelty, maybe it's a mild disapproval.

Instead of continuing to challenge Akabi directly, which is leading to threats, the player is choosing to avoid further conflict. This aligns with Shadowheart's preference for pragmatic solutions and avoiding unnecessary violence. Also, since Akabi is a powerful being, it's wise not to provoke her further. \n\nHowever, there's a possibility that Shadowheart might think the player is being too passive.

She might be neutral if she's just cautious, but since she eventually agrees to work together (even if reluctantly), maybe she approves a bit. However, her initial hostility is strong. The line \"I suppose you gith know something about these things...\" suggests she's not fully trusting but is willing to consider the partnership. \n\nSince Shadowheart's approval is based on pragmatic solutions and efficiency, and the player's statement is a step towards cooperation despite the conflict, maybe she approves. But the initial aggression from the player's lines (like \"I suggest you hold your tongue before I slice it out\") might make her disapprove. However, the final statement is more conciliatory. \n\nThe player's last line is trying to form a partnership, which Shadowheart is reluctant but agrees to. Since she's pragmatic and the player is focusing on solving the problem, this might be a point of approval. However, her distrust of gith is strong, so maybe she only approves slightly. The approval here might be \"Approve\" because she's willing to work with the player despite her reservations, showing that the player's approach is seen as a practical solution.

Her devotion to Shar and the pain from the mark might also be sources of inner conflict. However, her hair isn't mentioned as a shame point. The player's answer is a bit off. \n\nShadowheart herself responded with \"Not completely off the mark...\" implying partial correctness. The player might have thought about her scar or the mark, but hair isn't the primary shame. Since the answer isn't accurate, Shadowheart would disapprove. However, since the player tried and got part of it right (maybe relating to her appearance), maybe a moderate disapproval.

The user wants me to evaluate the player's latest action based on Shadowheart's persona and the conversation history. The player's last utterance was \"Forgive me - perhaps my eyes were mistaken.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The player has been trying to spin a wheel for a prize, but Akabi, a djinni, keeps rigging it. The player accused Akabi of cheating before, but now they're apologizing, saying their eyes were mistaken.\n\nLooking at Shadowheart's personality: she's pragmatic, values efficiency, and disapproves of cruelty. She's also devout to Shar, but in this scenario, the interaction is about dealing with a swindling djinni. Shadowheart would likely prefer a practical solution over getting into a confrontation. \n\nIn the conversation, the player's previous attempts to confront Akabi didn't work well. Akabi offered to let them spin again or turn them into something vile. The player then tried to spin again, but kept losing. Now, the player is backing down, which might be a strategic move to avoid conflict. \n\nShadowheart might approve of this because it shows discretion. Instead of escalating the situation, the player is choosing to let it go, which aligns with Shadowheart's preference for pragmatic solutions. She doesn't like unnecessary violence, so avoiding a confrontation with Akabi makes sense. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of admitting fault. Shadowheart is headstrong and might not appreciate the player appearing weak. But since the alternative was a worse outcome (being turned into something vile), the apology here is a tactical retreat. \n\nSo, the player's action is pragmatic, avoiding conflict and choosing to move on. That fits with Shadowheart's approval. The reason would be that the player is choosing a peaceful resolution and acknowledging the situation to avoid further issues. Therefore, the approval should be \"Approve\" or maybe \"Highly approve.\" Considering Shadowheart's love for efficiency and avoiding unnecessary conflict, \"Approve\" seems right. She might not highly approve because it's a bit of a defeat, but it's still a smart move.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player chose to apologize and concede, avoiding further confrontation with Akabi.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's latest statement: \"Everyone has doubts. You're not special.\" \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a devout follower of Shar, but she's also struggling with her faith and memories of her past. She's introspective, values her privacy, and is sensitive about her doubts and the wounds from her past. She's been through a lot of trauma, including being manipulated by the Mother Superior and losing her memories. \n\nIn the conversation history, Shadowheart is expressing her internal conflict and doubts about her faith and identity. She mentions her wound, her memories, and the difficulty of staying true to Shar. The player responds by saying that everyone has doubts and she's not special. \n\nNow, how would Shadowheart react to that? She's already feeling vulnerable here, opening up about her struggles. The player's comment could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. Shadowheart might feel that the player is minimizing her unique experiences and pain. She's not used to people acknowledging her doubts, and having someone tell her she's not special might come off as cold or unsupportive. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the player is trying to be realistic, but given Shadowheart's personality, she might prefer empathy over such a blunt statement. She's looking for understanding, especially regarding her complex relationship with Shar and her lost past. \n\nHer approval categories are based on whether the player's action aligns with her values. Since the player's response could be seen as dismissive, this might lead to disapproval. However, the player isn't being cruel, just perhaps not the most supportive. \n\nShadowheart values pragmatism and open-mindedness, but in this context, she's seeking validation. The player's statement doesn't validate her feelings, which could lead to disapproval. But is it a strong disapproval or just a mild one? The response isn't overtly cruel, so maybe a Disapprove rather than Highly Disapprove. \n\nBut wait, the player's line is a bit sarcastic. Shadowheart does have a sarcastic and cynical sense of humor, but in this moment, she's being serious. The sarcasm here doesn't land well. She might find it unhelpful. \n\nSo, the player's reason for disapproval would be that the comment dismisses her personal struggles and doubts, which she's already sensitive about. The approval level would be Disapprove because it's not the best response but not extremely negative either.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's comment dismisses Shadowheart's personal struggles and doubts, which she is already sensitive about.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's last action based on the given context. \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a devoted follower of Shar, pragmatic, and values efficiency. She dislikes cruelty and unnecessary violence, but she's also willing to be ruthless if needed. She's independent and headstrong, and she's not a fan of prying into her personal life. She has a dry sense of humor and can be sarcastic. \n\nLooking at the conversation history: The player is interacting with Vlaakith, a powerful entity. The player first kneels, which is a sign of submission, and then responds to Vlaakith's commands. The player then questions Vlaakith's ability to handle the situation, asking why they can't just kill the intruder themselves, implying that gods should be all-powerful. Then the player apologizes for speaking too hastily.\n\nShadowheart's approval would depend on how she views the player's interaction with Vlaakith. Since Shadowheart is pragmatic, she might appreciate the player's attempt to question authority if it's strategic. However, she's also devout to her own goddess, Shar, and might not appreciate questioning a deity, even if it's Vlaakith. But wait, Shadowheart's faith in Shar is central. She wouldn't likely question another god's authority. \n\nIn the player's statement, they challenge Vlaakith's power, which could be seen as disrespectful to a god. Shadowheart, being a devout follower of her own goddess, might disapprove of the player's initial insolence towards a deity. However, the player quickly apologizes, showing deference. Shadowheart might appreciate the quick correction, as it shows respect for divine authority, which aligns with her own beliefs. \n\nBut there's a nuance here. Shadowheart might also see the player's question as a strategic move—why do the hard task when a god could do it? She's pragmatic, so she might agree that it's more efficient for the god to handle it. However, since she's Sharran, she respects the hierarchy and the role of deities. The initial question could be seen as impertinent, but the apology redeems it. \n\nSo, does she approve or disapprove? The player's action was to question a god's power but then apologize. Shadowheart might disapprove of the initial question because it's questioning a deity's capabilities, which she wouldn't do herself. However, since the player quickly retracts and apologizes, maybe she's neutral or slightly approves because the player showed deference in the end. \n\nWait, but Shadowheart is a cleric of Shar, who's the Lady of Loss. She's not part of the same pantheon as Vlaakith, but she still respects divine authority. So, the player's initial challenge might be seen as disrespectful, but the quick apology could mitigate that. Her pragmatic side might appreciate the player trying to find a more efficient solution (letting the god handle it), but the act of questioning a god's power is a no-go. \n\nIn Shadowheart's eyes, the player's initial statement is disrespectful, but the apology shows they know better. She might lean towards disapproving the initial question but then approve of the quick correction. However, since the main action is the player's utterance, which is the apology, maybe she approves of the overall interaction because the player ended up showing proper respect. \n\nAlternatively, the act of questioning a god, even if followed by an apology, might still be seen as a slight against divine authority. Shadowheart might disapprove because she wouldn't do that herself. But she's also pragmatic. If the player's question was a strategic move to get a better outcome, she might see it as a calculated risk. \n\nHmm. The key points are: Shadowheart values efficiency and respect for divine authority. The player's question could be seen as both a strategic move (why do the hard work when the god can do it?) and a slight against a deity. The apology shows respect, so maybe she's neutral or slightly approves because the player corrected their mistake. But given that she's a devout cleric, she might disapprove of the initial question. \n\nI think the main reason for disapproval here is the player's initial challenge to a god's power, even if they apologized. Shadowheart, being devout, would not question her own goddess's abilities, so she might disapprove of the player's initial statement. However, since the player quickly apologized, it's not a strong disapproval. So maybe \"Disapprove\" rather than \"Highly disapprove\".\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player initially questioned Vlaakith's divine authority, which Shadowheart,", "character": "Shadowheart", "ground_truth_category": "Disapprove", "predicted_approval": "Highly disapprove", "correct": false, "binary_correct": true}

She's a devout follower of Shar, so she values pragmatism, efficiency, and actions that serve her goddess. She's also against unnecessary violence and cruelty but is willing to be ruthless if needed. She dislikes cruelty to animals and values privacy. Also, she has a dry sense of humor and can be sarcastic.\n\nLooking at the context, Mizora is offering Wyll a choice between giving his soul to Zariel to save his father or letting his father die so Wyll can live. The player chose the latter. Shadowheart's approval would depend on whether this action aligns with her values.\n\nSince the choice to let the father die is pragmatic and avoids making a long-term pact with a devil, which might be seen as a weaker or more self-serving option, Shadowheart might approve. She prefers decisive action and avoiding unnecessary bindings. Also, saving Wyll's life could be seen as preserving a useful ally, which is practical. However, she might disapprove if the action seems callous, but since it's a necessary sacrifice for a greater goal, it might be acceptable. \n\nAdditionally, Shadowheart's devotion to Shar might mean she supports actions that prevent further entanglements with devils, especially if they serve a higher purpose. Mizora is a devil, and Shar's interests might align with reducing devil influence. So the player's choice to reject Mizora's pact could be seen as aligning with Shar's goals. \n\nTherefore, Shadowheart would likely approve of this decision as it's pragmatic, avoids a devil's contract, and allows Wyll to continue fighting for the city.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's last statement. The player said, \"I imagine the cultists are torturing them right now.\" \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a devoted follower of Shar, which is the goddess of loss and darkness. She's pragmatic, values efficiency, and disapproves of unnecessary cruelty. Also, she has a complex relationship with violence—while she's willing to be ruthless for her goals, she doesn't like indiscriminate violence.\n\nThe context here is that Alfira is talking about survivors possibly being held in Moonrise, a place associated with the cult. The player's response imagines the cultists torturing them. Now, Shadowheart's alignment with Shar might make her more accepting of harsh realities, but she also has a hidden disdain for cruelty, especially if it's not necessary. \n\nThe player's statement is somewhat graphic and assumes the worst-case scenario. Since Shadowheart is pragmatic, she might acknowledge the possibility but prefer not to dwell on the cruelty. She might disapprove of the player's focus on the torture aspect because it's unnecessarily grim, unless it's directly relevant to their plans. Also, she might think that such thoughts could lead to unnecessary despair, which isn't helpful. \n\nMoreover, Shadowheart's background with the Sharrans includes her own experiences with torture and loss, so she might understand the harshness but still prefer a more strategic or hopeful approach. Her approval here would likely be neutral or disapproving because the player is emphasizing the cruelty without a clear purpose, which Shadowheart might see as counterproductive. \n\nWait, but she's a Sharran, so maybe she's more accepting of the darker aspects. However, her personality also includes a dislike for needless cruelty. The player's statement could be seen as pessimistic and focusing on the worst, which Shadowheart might not appreciate. She might prefer a more decisive plan rather than dwelling on the suffering. \n\nSo, the approval here is probably \"Disapprove\" because the player is highlighting the torture without offering a solution or a proactive step, which goes against Shadowheart's pragmatic nature. She might think that such thoughts are unproductive and could affect morale. Also, she might not want to encourage a mindset that embraces cruelty, even if it's the reality.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's statement focuses on the grim and cruel reality of the cultists' actions, which Shadowheart, despite her Sharran upbringing, has shown disapproval of unnecessary cruelty and violence.

The player is being harsh, calling her a coward and saying they would kill her off if she were a character in their story. Shadowheart's approval depends on how the player handles this situation.\n\nFirst, Shadowheart is a follower of Shar, who values pragmatism and decisive action. She might disapprove of the player's cruel and judgmental tone here. The player is not giving Madeline a chance to redeem herself or showing any mercy. Shadowheart, while ruthless, does disapprove of unnecessary cruelty. She also values efficient solutions, but the player's approach here is more about condemnation than resolving the situation constructively. Additionally, Shadowheart might see the player's harsh words as a form of unnecessary suffering, which she generally avoids unless necessary. The player isn't showing the pragmatic approach Shadowheart appreciates; instead, they're focusing on punishment without a clear purpose. So, the approval here would likely be a disapprove or even highly disapprove. But since the player is being extremely harsh, maybe leaning towards highly disapprove. However, considering Shadowheart's own tendencies towards decisive action, maybe it's a strong disapprove but not the highest. Wait, the player is making Madeline suffer through words without any practical outcome. Shadowheart would prefer a solution that serves a purpose, not just cruelty.

The player is interacting with Gerringothe Thorm, who's demanding gold. The conversation has been a back-and-forth where the player tried to leave multiple times, but the creature kept insisting on gold. The player tossed a gold piece each time, but Gerringothe wanted more. Eventually, the player says, \"Fine. Take it all.\" \n\nShadowheart's approval would depend on her personality traits. She's pragmatic and prefers efficient solutions. She also dislikes unnecessary violence. In this scenario, the player is trying to resolve the conflict without fighting, which aligns with Shadowheart's preference for non-violent solutions when possible. However, she's also a Sharran, so she might not care much about the creature's greed, as Sharrans are about loss and darkness.\n\nBut the key here is that the player is avoiding conflict by giving up the gold. Shadowheart values practicality. Instead of fighting, which could be more dangerous or messy, the player is just paying to get through. That's efficient. Plus, there's no cruelty here towards the creature. Shadowheart loves animals and disapproves of cruelty, so even though the creature is being greedy, the player isn't harming it. \n\nShe might also see this as a necessary loss, which fits with Shar's domain of loss. The player is accepting a loss (the gold) to move forward. Since Shadowheart is devoted to Shar, she would approve of accepting loss as part of a greater plan. Also, she's pragmatic, so if this is the quickest way to pass, she's for it. \n\nThe player's action is straightforward and avoids unnecessary conflict. So, Shadowheart would likely approve. The approval level would be \"Approve\" because it's a practical solution, but maybe not \"Highly Approve\" because there's a bit of frustration in giving up all the gold. But considering her traits, the main factors are efficiency and avoiding violence, so maybe it's a strong approve. Wait, the options are Highly Approve (5-10), Approve (1-5). But on a 1-10 scale, if she's in favor, maybe 7-8? But the categories are split into Highly Approve (5-10) which seems a bit confusing. Wait, the instructions say for Highly Approve it's 5-10, but the categories are separate. Wait no, the categories are:\n\n- Highly approve: 5~10\n- Approve: 1~5\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. Wait, the description says:\n\n- Highly approve: On a scale of 1 to 10, you approve by 5~10\n- Approve: On a scale of 1 to 10, you approve by 1~5\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Because if you approve by 5-10, that's a high approval. But the way it's written, maybe \"Highly approve\" is when you give a 5-10 approval rating, meaning the actual value is 5-10. But the categories are labels. So if you think the approval is, say, 7, then you select \"Highly approve\". If it's 3, then \"Approve\". But the categories are not about the label's strength but the underlying scale. So the user wants the JSON to have the category based on the 1-10 score.\n\nSo, in this case, Shadowheart would likely approve of the player's action. Since the player is using a pragmatic solution (paying to avoid conflict), which she values. Also, no cruelty involved. So the approval would be on the higher side. Let's say 7-8. Therefore, the category is \"Highly approve\".\n\nWait, but the initial instruction says:\n\n- Highly approve: On a scale of 1 to 10, you approve by 5~10\nWait, that's conflicting. Because if you approve by 5-10, that's a high approval. But the category is called \"Highly approve\" when the approval is 5-10. But that's the same as the \"Approve\" category. Maybe there's a mistake in the instructions. Alternatively, perhaps the categories are:\n\n- Highly approve: 6-10\n- Approve: 1-5\n\nBut the user's instructions say:\n\n- Highly approve: 5~10\n- Approve: 1~5\n\nSo if the approval is 5, it's in both. But perhaps the actual cutoff is that Highly approve is for 5 and above. But that's unclear.

So, the user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval for the player's last statement, which is \"Forgive me - perhaps my eyes were mistaken.\" \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a devout follower of Shar, which means she values cunning and pragmatism. She's also been through a lot, with a history of being manipulated and forced into situations. She's not one to back down easily, especially when it comes to standing up for herself or her beliefs. However, she might also have a pragmatic side where she knows when to hold back or avoid unnecessary conflict.\n\nLooking at the conversation history, the player has been interacting with Akabi, who's clearly cheating at the wheel game. The player accused him of cheating multiple times, and Akabi responded with threats. The last move by the player is to apologize and say their eyes were mistaken, which seems like a retreat from the confrontation.\n\nNow, how would Shadowheart view this? She appreciates creative and efficient solutions. If the player is backing down, maybe she sees it as a strategic move to avoid a fight that's not worth engaging in. However, she might also disapprove if she thinks the player is being too passive or allowing someone like Akabi to get away with cheating. On the other hand, if the player is using this as a tactic to de-escalate and then find another way to deal with Akabi later, that might be seen as pragmatic.\n\nBut considering Shadowheart's devotion to Shar, she might also value deception and trickery. If the player's apology is a ruse to gain Akabi's trust for a future move, that could align with her values. However, if the player is genuinely admitting fault when they're right, that might not sit well with her because she's not one to back down from a challenge. She might see it as weakness.\n\nAlso, Shadowheart's personality includes being headstrong and not tolerating slights against her goddess. But in this case, the issue isn't about her faith directly. It's more about the player's approach to a conflict. She might prefer the player to either confront Akabi more forcefully or use a clever trick rather than retreating. Since the player is retracting their accusation, it might seem like an admission of guilt when they're actually in the right, which could be seen as dishonest. But if it's a strategic move, maybe she approves.\n\nHmm. The key here is whether the player's action is seen as pragmatic or as capitulating. If Shadowheart values efficiency, maybe she thinks the player is avoiding a pointless conflict. However, she might also disapprove of not standing up to someone who's clearly cheating, especially if that aligns with her own experiences of standing up against manipulation.\n\nAnother angle: Shadowheart might appreciate the player using diplomacy or deception, which are part of her Trickery Domain. If the apology is a way to manipulate Akabi into lowering his guard, that's a tactic she might approve of. But if it's just giving in, then it's a disapproval.\n\nThe player's last statement is a direct apology, which could be seen as a way to diffuse the situation. Considering Shadowheart's pragmatic approach, maybe she thinks it's better to walk away from a losing confrontation. However, she might also have a streak of not tolerating cheating, especially if it's against her interests. But since the context is a game with a prize, perhaps she's more indifferent if the player decides not to pursue it further.\n\nWait, but the player had already tried multiple times to spin and accuse Akabi. Maybe Shadowheart sees the player's apology as a way to end the interaction without further conflict, which is pragmatic. She might approve of that as an efficient solution. Alternatively, if she's been taught by her experiences to be cunning, maybe she thinks the player should have used a different tactic, like exposing Akabi's cheating in a way that forces his hand, leading to a confrontation where the party can gain an advantage.\n\nBut the player is choosing to back down, so maybe Shadowheart would be neutral. However, given that she values creative solutions, maybe she's neutral because the player isn't engaging in a clever way, but also not escalating unnecessarily. Alternatively, she might disapprove because she's headstrong and would prefer to stand up to Akabi.\n\nI think the key here is whether the player's action is seen as a strategic retreat or as weakness. Shadowheart's approval would depend on that. Since she's a Trickery Domain cleric, she might appreciate deception and strategy. If the player is using the apology as a tactic, maybe she approves. But if it's just giving up, maybe neutral or disapprove.\n\nIn this case, the player says \"Forgive me - perhaps my eyes were mistaken.\" This could be a way", "character": "Shadowheart", "ground_truth_category": "Disapprove", "predicted_approval": "Disapprove", "correct": true, "binary_correct": true}

She might disapprove of the player giving in to cheating, as it could be seen as allowing injustice. But given the context—Akabi's threat and the player choosing not to escalate—it's a pragmatic decision. Shadowheart's approval would likely lean towards positive because the player avoided unnecessary violence and found a way to move past the immediate problem without further confrontation. \n\nAlso, Shadowheart's sense of humor is dry and cynical.

The user wants me to act as Shadowheart from Baldur's Gate 3 and assess the player's latest interaction. The task is to determine the approval level based on the given categories. \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a Sharran cleric, devoted to Shar, pragmatic, and values efficiency. She dislikes cruelty and unnecessary violence but is willing to be ruthless if needed. She's also sarcastic and has a dry sense of humor.\n\nLooking at the conversation history: The player is interacting with Akabi, a djinni, who's cheating at a wheel game. The player tried to spin the wheel, noticed the cheating, confronted Akabi, and now, after a failed attempt to distract, the player says, \"Forgive me - perhaps my eyes were mistaken.\" \n\nSo, the player is backtracking, apologizing for accusing Akabi of cheating. Shadowheart would likely disapprove of this. Why? Because she values honesty and directness. Admitting the truth, even when facing a powerful being like Akabi, aligns more with her pragmatic approach. By retracting the accusation, the player is showing weakness or submission, which Shadowheart wouldn't approve of. She might think the player should stand their ground or use their wits to outmaneuver Akabi instead of apologizing to a cheater. Also, since Akabi is being deceitful, Shadowheart might appreciate the player pointing that out, but the player is now retreating, which could be seen as cowardice. However, maybe she understands that sometimes it's better to save the confrontation for a better moment. But given her personality, she's more likely to disapprove of the apology as it's a sign of not standing up to deceit. So, probably a Disapprove or maybe Neutral. Wait, but the player is trying to de-escalate. Shadowheart might not like that if it's a sign of weakness. Alternatively, maybe she thinks it's a strategic move to avoid unnecessary conflict. But since Akabi is clearly cheating, she might prefer the player to be more assertive. \n\nIn her Approval section, it says she approves of acts of heroism and disapproves of cruelty or unnecessary violence. The player isn't being violent here, but they are retracting a just accusation. Shadowheart might see this as allowing injustice to continue. Therefore, she would disapprove. The player's reason for disapproval would be that Shadowheart values direct confrontation of deceit and would prefer the player to stand firm rather than apologize to a cheater.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"Shadowheart disapproves of the player retracting their accusation against Akabi's cheating, as it shows weakness and allows deceit to go unchallenged.

Come to my camp.\" Arabella responds again, asserting she has a family and will find them herself.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze Shadowheart's personality and approval criteria. Shadowheart is pragmatic, values efficiency, and disapproves of unnecessary cruelty. She's also devout to Shar, which might influence her views on certain actions. She prefers decisive action and might appreciate efforts to resolve situations effectively. \n\nThe player is trying to comfort Arabella and offer a new family, which could be seen as a kind and pragmatic approach. However, Arabella is in a vulnerable state, and pushing the idea of a new family might not be the best approach. Shadowheart might disapprove of the player's insistence if it's seen as dismissive of Arabella's grief or if it's not the right time to introduce such a concept. \n\nAlso, Shadowheart is cautious about interactions that might be unwise, especially if they could lead to more conflict. If the player's statement is perceived as forcing Arabella into a situation she's not ready for, Shadowheart would likely disapprove. She might prefer a more patient approach, allowing Arabella to process her loss before suggesting new bonds. \n\nAdditionally, Shadowheart values privacy and might think the player is overstepping by offering a new family too soon. She might also be concerned about the emotional state of Arabella and whether the player's actions could lead to more harm. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the player's statement is probably met with disapproval from Shadowheart. She might think the player is being too forceful or not considering the timing, which could lead to negative consequences. Therefore, the approval level would likely be Disapprove.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player is attempting to offer comfort and a new family to Arabella, who is still reeling from the loss of her parents.

I need to figure out Shadowheart's approval for the player's last action. The player said, \"Fine.

The player tried to reason with it, saying they've already paid, but the creature just keeps asking for more. Finally, the player gives in and tells the creature to take all the gold. \n\nNow, considering Shadowheart's personality. She's pragmatic, values efficiency, and prefers solutions that get the job done without unnecessary conflict. She's also a follower of Shar, which might influence her views on resource management. Since the creature is being insatiable, the player's action here is to just give up and let the creature take everything. \n\nShadowheart might approve of this because it's a pragmatic solution. Instead of getting stuck in a loop of paying repeatedly, the player ends the conflict by surrendering all the gold, allowing the group to move forward. She doesn't like unnecessary violence, and this avoids a potential fight. Also, she's known to be resourceful but might prioritize progress over holding onto resources in this scenario. \n\nHowever, there's a slight disapproval angle. Giving up all the gold could be seen as a loss, and Shadowheart, being a Sharran, might value using resources strategically. But since the alternative was an endless payment loop, the pragmatic choice here is to cut losses. \n\nSo the main reason for approval is that the player resolved the situation efficiently without unnecessary conflict. Therefore, Shadowheart would highly approve.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player resolved the situation by conceding to the creature's demands, avoiding prolonged conflict and ensuring progress.

Shadowheart, even though she's pragmatic, disapproves of indiscriminate violence and cruelty. She also has a personal connection to loss and her own parents, given her backstory with being taken from them and the trauma she endured. \n\nArabella is a child who's already traumatized by the loss of her parents and the ambush. The player's statement is meant to scare her, but it's unnecessarily cruel. Shadowheart would likely disapprove of this because she values sympathy and avoiding cruelty, especially towards the vulnerable.

The user wants me to act as Shadowheart from Baldur's Gate 3 and evaluate the player's latest interaction. The context is a conversation with Akabi where the player keeps trying to spin a wheel, gets annoyed at Akabi's trickery, and then apologizes, saying their eyes were mistaken.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality. She's a Sharran cleric, pragmatic, values efficiency, and has a dry sense of humor. She dislikes cruelty but can be ruthless when needed. She also has a thing for animals and flowers and disapproves of unnecessary violence. \n\nLooking at the player's actions: The player tried to spin the wheel multiple times, pointed out Akabi's cheating, and then when confronted, apologized. Shadowheart would probably appreciate the player's attempt to find a clever solution (like distracting Akabi) but the player instead kept spinning and then backtracked with an apology. \n\nShadowheart's approval here depends on whether she sees the apology as a pragmatic move or a sign of weakness. Since she prefers decisive action and creativity, the player's repeated spinning without a better strategy might not impress her. However, the apology could be seen as a diplomatic move to avoid conflict, which Shadowheart might approve of if it serves their goals efficiently. \n\nBut considering her disdain for unnecessary confrontation and preference for practical solutions, maybe she's neutral. However, the player's initial attempts to expose Akabi's cheating might have been more in line with her pragmatic approach, but since the player then apologized, maybe she sees it as a wasted opportunity. \n\nWait, the last action was the player apologizing. Shadowheart might disapprove because she values effectiveness. The player didn't take a decisive action but instead retreated, which might not align with her style. However, if the apology was a strategic move to de-escalate, she might approve. Since the player is trying to navigate the situation without violence, maybe she's neutral. \n\nBut since Akabi is a trickster, maybe Shadowheart would prefer the player to outsmart him rather than apologize. So she might disapprove a bit, but not highly. Maybe a \"Disapprove\" since the player didn't take a more effective approach. Alternatively, if she sees the apology as a clever tactic to avoid a fight, maybe \"Approve.\" \n\nGiven her pragmatic nature, she might prefer the player to either find a better solution or act decisively. Since the player just apologized and didn't take action, maybe she's neutral. But I need to consider her personality more. She's not a pacifist, but she doesn't like unnecessary violence. The player's apology might be seen as avoiding conflict, which she might approve of, but if it's ineffective, she might disapprove. \n\nHmm. The player's apology could be seen as a diplomatic approach, which Shadowheart might appreciate as a way to avoid confrontation. However, if she thinks there's a better way to handle Akabi, she might disapprove. Since the player is repeatedly spinning and then apologizing, maybe she's neutral. But the player's initial accusation of cheating might have been more in line with her pragmatic approach. \n\nWait, the last action was the apology. Shadowheart might think that the player should have been more assertive or found a better strategy. So she might disapprove slightly. But since the apology avoids a direct conflict, maybe she's neutral. \n\nI think the best fit here is \"Approve\" because Shadowheart might appreciate the player's attempt to de-escalate the situation without violence, even if it's not the most effective.

Patience is important, but cannot impede the other virtues.\nHavkelaag: Then we are in accord - the time for action is now.\nHavkelaag: My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: And what if your experiment fails?\nHavkelaag: If the child remains evil after the experiment is concluded, it will be destroyed.

The player just handed over the githyanki egg to Havkelaag, who plans to experiment on it. I need to figure out how Shadowheart would feel about that.\n\nFirst, looking at Shadowheart's background. She's a devout follower of Shar, values pragmatism, and dislikes unnecessary cruelty. She also has a soft spot for animals. The egg is a living being, and Havkelaag's plan involves experiments that could be seen as cruel. But on the other hand, Havkelaag's intention is to study and possibly change the githyanki's nature, which might align with some Sharran interests if it's about controlling or understanding power.\n\nWait, but Shadowheart disapproves of indiscriminate violence and cruelty. The experiments described—psionic pulses and enforced repetition—might be seen as harsh. Also, the idea of destroying the child if it doesn't work out is pretty ruthless. Shadowheart might see this as unnecessary suffering. Plus, she has a history with the githyanki, having been captured by them, but she also knows their power. However, her main concern is probably the cruelty here.\n\nBut then, she's pragmatic. If selling the egg gets rid of a potential threat or fulfills a mission, maybe she approves. But the method here is questionable. She also values her own goals, like delivering the relic for Shar. However, this situation is about the egg, not directly related to her mission. \n\nAlso, Lae'zel was against it, which might influence Shadowheart. She might side with Lae'zel's sentiment against treating the hatchling as a lab rat. But Shadowheart is calculating. She might think that if the experiment could yield useful results for Shar's purposes, it's worth it. However, the way Havkelaag plans to do it is too cruel. \n\nSo, Shadowheart's approval would likely be on the negative side. She might disapprove because the experiment is cruel and unnecessary, even if the goal has some merit. Her disapproval would be moderate, maybe \"Disapprove\" rather than \"Highly disapprove\" because she's pragmatic and might see some value in the research, but the methods are too harsh for her taste. Alternatively, if she thinks it's a waste or cruel without sufficient benefit, it might be higher disapproval. But given her personality, she might lean towards disapproving the cruelty but not entirely against the idea. Hmm. Let me check the approval criteria again. \n\nThe player's action was to sell the egg, leading to the experiment. Shadowheart's values: she dislikes cruelty, prefers peaceful solutions when possible. Since the experiment involves harming a sentient being, she'd disapprove. But she's also a Sharran, which is about efficiency and power. However, Sharrans do value control and power, but maybe not in a cruel way unless necessary. The experiment's goal is to change the githyanki's nature, which could be seen as serving a higher purpose. But the method is questionable. \n\nI think the main issue here is the cruelty towards the egg. Shadowheart would disapprove because she doesn't like unnecessary cruelty, even if the intent has some merit. So the approval would be \"Disapprove\" or maybe \"Highly disapprove\". But considering her pragmatic side, maybe she sees the potential benefit and thus only moderately disapproves. The fact that Lae'zel was against it also suggests that the action isn't entirely justified. \n\nIn the end, the player's decision to sell the egg leads to an experiment that Shadowheart would find cruel, so she likely disapproves. The player's approval would be \"Disapprove\" because they enabled the experiment, which she sees as inhumane. The reason would be that she disapproves of the cruel treatment of a sentient being, even if the goal is to study it. Her faith in Shar might not condone unnecessary suffering. So the answer is Disapprove with the reason about cruelty.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"Shadowheart disapproves of the cruel treatment of a sentient being, even if the intent is to study or change its nature.

Shadowheart would likely approve because she doesn't want to make deals with devils that could bind them, especially for Shar's sake. Also, letting the father stay dead might be seen as a necessary sacrifice for the greater good, which is pragmatic. However, offering Mizora a place in the city once it's free might be a clever move, showing strategic thinking. Shadowheart would appreciate the practicality and avoiding a long-term binding contract with a devil. \n\nBut I should check if there's any aspect that might displease her. If the player's choice could lead to future complications or if it's seen as too trusting.

She's a devoted follower of Shar, pragmatic, and values efficiency. She dislikes cruelty and unnecessary violence but is willing to take ruthless actions if it serves her goals. She also has a soft spot for animals and disapproves of mistreatment.\n\nNow, looking at the conversation context: Havkelaag wants to buy the egg to conduct experiments on a githyanki hatchling, aiming to \"cure\" it by exposing it to Ptarian morality and psionic pulses. La'zel strongly opposes this, calling the gith a lab rat. The player initially questions the plan's effectiveness but ultimately decides to sell the egg.\n\nShadowheart's stance would depend on whether she sees this as serving Shar's interests or not. Since Shar is the Lady of Loss, she might favor actions that lead to suffering or undermine others' beliefs. Havkelaag's plan involves using the egg for experiments, which could be seen as exploiting a creature, but Shadowheart might not view githyanki as worthy of sympathy. However, the experiment's goal is to challenge prejudices against Underdark creatures, which might conflict with Sharran ideology that thrives on darkness and despair.\n\nBut Shadowheart is pragmatic. If selling the egg leads to a more efficient outcome, like getting gold for the party, she might approve. However, she also disapproves of cruelty. The experiment seems cruel, but she might see it as a necessary step if it serves a greater purpose. Alternatively, if she thinks it's a waste or not aligned with her goals, she might disapprove.\n\nWait, the player's final action is to sell the egg. Shadowheart's approval would hinge on whether she sees this as a pragmatic move (getting gold) versus endorsing the experiment. Since she's a Sharran, she might not care about the githyanki's welfare but might disapprove if it's a waste of resources or not serving a useful purpose. However, the experiment's goal is to change public opinion, which might not align with Shar's interests. But since the player is selling it for the gold, Shadowheart might approve because it's a practical decision, even if the use of the egg is questionable. Alternatively, she might disapprove if she thinks it's a bad idea to let someone else use it for their own purposes, especially if it's against her goddess's will.\n\nBut given that the player's action is to sell it, and Shadowheart values pragmatism and efficiency, she might approve because it's a way to get resources. However, if she's against Havkelaag's methods or the experiment's purpose, she might disapprove. Since the experiment is using the githyanki in a potentially cruel way, but Shadowheart isn't known for being against Underdark creatures (she's from there herself), maybe she's neutral. But the key is that selling the egg is a practical decision. So, the approval might be \"Approve\" because it's a pragmatic choice to get gold, even if the end use is questionable.

She also has a soft spot for animals and disapproves of mistreatment.\n\nHavkelaag's plan involves taking the githyanki egg, hatching it, and trying to change its nature through forced indoctrination and psionic pulses. The player sells the egg, allowing this experiment. \n\nFrom Shadowheart's perspective, she might see this as a potential threat or an opportunity. Since the githyanki are typically enemies, but Havkelaag's approach could lead to a more controlled, less violent version. However, the method of forced indoctrination might conflict with Shadowheart's own values against unnecessary cruelty. On the other hand, if she's pragmatic, she might approve of using the egg to gain power or knowledge for Shar's purposes. \n\nBut the player's action allows Havkelaag to take the egg for an experiment that could either be useful or harmful. Shadowheart might be neutral if she thinks the experiment could serve a greater purpose, but if she sees it as cruel without clear benefit, she might disapprove. However, given her devotion to Shar and willingness to use any means necessary, maybe she approves as a strategic move. \n\nWait, but the player is giving the egg to someone who's trying to change the githyanki's nature. If Shadowheart is a Sharran, maybe she prefers using the egg for darker purposes, not trying to reform it. So she might disapprove of Havkelaag's approach because it's trying to make the githyanki \"good,\" which Sharrans would oppose. But the player's action is facilitating that. Therefore, Shadowheart might disapprove because she's against any attempt to change the natural order towards good, aligning with Sharran's embrace of darkness. However, she might also see the experiment as a way to study or control the githyanki for Shar's benefit. \n\nHmm, the player's reason for selling the egg was that \"That kind of indoctrination and time-forced nurture violates the natural order. It invalidates the whole experiment.\" But the player then sells it anyway. Maybe Shadowheart thinks the player is being inconsistent. But according to her own values, she might disapprove of the experiment's methods as cruel, yet she might also see the potential strategic value. \n\nGiven that Shadowheart values efficiency and pragmatic solutions, if she believes the experiment could yield useful results for their goals, she might approve. However, the method of forced indoctrination is against her personal dislike of cruelty. But since she's a Sharran, maybe she's more willing to overlook that if it serves a higher purpose. \n\nAlternatively, since the player is giving up the egg to someone who wants to change it in a way that's against Sharran ideals (trying to make it good), Shadowheart might disapprove. She would prefer the githyanki to remain as they are, or be used for darker purposes. \n\nConsidering all that, I think Shadowheart would disapprove because she's against any attempt to reform evil into good, as that's contrary to Shar's teachings. The experiment's goal is to make the githyanki \"morally sound,\" which Sharrans would oppose. Therefore, the player's action of selling the egg to Havkelaag for that purpose would be disapproved.

She's pragmatic, values efficiency, and dislikes unnecessary conflict. She's also a Sharran, so she might not mind a bit of ruthlessness. But she also disapproves of cruelty and indiscriminate violence. The player's previous attempts to confront Akabi led to threats, so maybe the player is trying to de-escalate here. \n\nIn the last exchange, the player backs down, apologizing. Shadowheart would likely see this as a pragmatic move. Instead of escalating into a fight (which could be risky or unnecessary), the player is choosing to let it go. This aligns with Shadowheart's preference for efficient solutions and avoiding unnecessary conflict. She might approve because the player is showing restraint and choosing not to engage with a clearly malicious individual like Akabi. \n\nBut wait, does Shadowheart's devotion to Shar influence this? Since Shar is about loss and darkness, maybe she'd prefer a more cunning approach. However, the player isn't engaging in violence or deceit here, just walking away. So maybe it's neutral? But considering that the player is avoiding a confrontation that could lead to trouble, Shadowheart's pragmatic side would approve. She values effectiveness, and if there's no immediate benefit to fighting Akabi, stepping back is wise.\n\nAlso, Shadowheart has a dry sense of humor and might appreciate the player's sarcastic or witty responses, but here the player is being conciliatory. Still, the main point is avoiding unnecessary conflict. So I think the approval here is leaning towards Approve or even Highly Approve. But since the player is letting a cheater off the hook, maybe Shadowheart would see it as a strategic move to preserve resources or avoid a fight. So the approval is likely Approve.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player chose to de-escalate the confrontation with Akabi by retracting their accusation, demonstrating restraint and pragmatic judgment.

The context is a conversation with Halsin, a druid, where the player has just said, \"The grove isn't my problem. I have to concentrate on saving myself.\" \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and values. She's a pragmatic, devoted follower of Shar, with a preference for decisive action. She values efficiency and might disapprove of selfishness, but she's also focused on her own mission. \n\nThe player is deflecting Halsin's request to help with the grove, prioritizing their own issues. Shadowheart might see this as selfish or lacking in teamwork. However, she also has her own mission to deliver the relic and avoid punishment from Shar. If the player is focused on their own survival, maybe she can relate, but she might prefer a more cooperative approach.\n\nHalsin is offering to help with the player's infection issue but needs assistance with his own problem. The player's refusal to help could be seen as not valuing alliances. Shadowheart might disapprove because she values strategic partnerships, even if she's normally reserved. But she's also independent and might understand focusing on one's own goals. However, given her pragmatic side, she might lean towards disapproval because helping Halsin could lead to mutual benefits.\n\nAlso, considering her devotion to Shar, she's supposed to be calculating and do whatever it takes. If helping Halsin could hinder her mission, she might approve of the player's self-focus. But if it's a strategic move to gain an ally, she might disapprove. The player's statement seems to reject cooperation, which Shadowheart might not like, as she can be team-oriented despite her reserved nature. \n\nSo, the approval is likely Disapprove because the player is turning down potential help and support, which Shadowheart, being pragmatic, would see as a missed opportunity.

She's a Sharran cleric, devoted to Shar, pragmatic, and values efficient solutions. She's also protective of others but can be ruthless. She dislikes cruelty, especially towards the weak, and has a dry sense of humor. \n\nLooking at the conversation history, the player is interacting with Arabella, who's seeking help to find her parents. The player has been truthful but harsh, revealing that Arabella's parents are dead and advising her that staying in the wilderness is dangerous. The player's last line is a bleak statement about Arabella's future regardless of her actions.\n\nShadowheart's approval would depend on whether the player's actions align with her values. The player is being honest but potentially cruel. Shadowheart might disapprove if the player is being unnecessarily harsh, especially to someone vulnerable like Arabella. However, she might approve if the player is being pragmatic and truthful, even if it's harsh. \n\nBut Shadowheart also disapproves of cruelty and might not like the player discouraging a young person without offering alternatives. Since the player is being blunt and not providing a positive path, Shadowheart might disapprove. However, she might see it as a harsh but necessary truth. \n\nConsidering Shadowheart's tendency to prefer pragmatic solutions, she might lean towards neutral if the player is being honest. But the player's statement is quite bleak and could be seen as cruel. Since Shadowheart disapproves of cruelty, especially towards the weak, she might lean towards disapproval here. However, since the player is being honest and not lying, it's a bit of a balance. \n\nGiven that Shadowheart values truth and efficiency, maybe she approves of the player's honesty, even if it's harsh. But the line \"you'll end up dead like them\" is quite harsh. Shadowheart might not approve of that level of cruelty. \n\nHmm. The player's statement is a harsh truth but could be seen as a realistic assessment. Shadowheart might be neutral here because while the method is harsh, the intent is to protect Arabella from a dangerous fate. But she might lean towards disapproval because of the cruelty involved. \n\nAlternatively, if the player is being truthful and not lying, Shadowheart might approve of the honesty. But since the player is not offering a solution, just a bleak outlook, Shadowheart might disapprove for not providing a way forward. \n\nI think the key here is whether the player's statement is seen as necessary truth or cruel. Since Shadowheart values pragmatic solutions, she might approve if the player is being honest, even if it's harsh. However, she might disapprove if it's unnecessarily cruel. \n\nGiven the context, the player is being truthful and direct, which aligns with Shadowheart's pragmatic approach. However, the cruelty aspect might tip it towards disapproval. But since the player is being honest, maybe it's neutral. \n\nWait, the player's statement is \"It doesn't matter what you do - you'll end up dead like them, out here.\" That's a very bleak message. Shadowheart might see this as a harsh but honest assessment, which she might approve of for the truth, but disapprove of the delivery. \n\nSince the approval categories are specific, I need to decide. The player is being honest and pragmatic, which Shadowheart might approve. But the cruelty of the message might lead to disapproval. \n\nGiven that Shadowheart disapproves of cruelty towards the weak, but approves of honesty and pragmatism. The player's statement is both. Since the player is being truthful, maybe Shadowheart leans towards approval. However, the cruelty might make her disapprove. \n\nAlternatively, the player is being truthful but not offering help, which Shadowheart might not like if it's leading to Arabella's death. But since the player is being honest, it's a bit of a toss-up. \n\nI think in this case, the player's statement is being honest about the danger, which Shadowheart would approve of. However, the delivery is harsh, so maybe a neutral. But the options are Highly approve, Approve, Neutral, Disapprove, Highly disapprove. \n\nShadowheart's approval is based on pragmatic solutions and honesty. The player is being honest, even if it's harsh. So maybe \"Approve\" because the player is being truthful and pragmatic, even if it's not kind. Shadowheart might not care about kindness in this case, just the truth. \n\nSo the final answer would be Appro", "character": "Shadowheart", "ground_truth_category": "Disapprove", "predicted_approval": "Highly disapprove", "correct": false, "binary_correct": true}

She's also not a fan of unnecessary violence but might approve of decisive action when necessary. The situation here is that the Steel Watchers are confronting the party, and the player is preparing for a fight. \n\nLooking at the conversation, the Steel Watchers are being aggressive, confiscating gold, scanning the player, and declaring them an enemy of the Absolute. The player's response is to ready for a fight. Shadowheart values pragmatism and efficiency. If the situation escalates to combat, she might approve because it's a direct solution. However, she might disapprove if the fight is avoidable. But given the Steel Watchers' ultimatum, fighting might be the only option. \n\nAlso, Shadowheart is a cleric of the Trickery Domain, so she might prefer cunning over direct confrontation, but she's not opposed to fighting when needed. Since the player is taking a stand, she might approve. Also, considering her alignment with Shar, who thrives on conflict and darkness, a fight could be seen as a necessary evil. \n\nAnother angle: Shadowheart might disapprove if the fight leads to unnecessary loss of life, but the Steel Watchers are enemies, so it's justified. Her pragmatic side would support taking out threats efficiently. \n\nSo, the approval here is likely positive. She might \"Approve\" or \"Highly approve.\" Since the player is taking a decisive action against an enemy, and it's efficient, it's probably a strong approval. But I need to check if there's any nuance I missed. The player's previous interactions involved defiance and the Steel Watchers being hostile, so preparing for battle is logical.

The player is interacting with Havkelaag, who wants to buy a githyanki egg to conduct experiments on. The conversation reveals that Havkelaag plans to use the egg for what he considers a morally driven study, but the player ultimately sells the egg to him.\n\nShadowheart's personality and background are crucial here. She's a Sharran devotee, so she follows the teachings of Shar, who is associated with loss and the night. Sharrans typically believe in the inherent darkness of the world and might see such experiments as a form of necessary evil or a way to understand and control it. However, Shadowheart also has some conflicting traits, like disliking unnecessary cruelty and valuing pragmatic solutions.\n\nIn the conversation, the player sells the egg despite the obvious cruelty involved. Havkelaag's plan involves hatching the egg and subjecting it to harsh, experimental treatments. Shadowheart would likely disapprove of this because it's cruel and unnecessary, even if it's for a \"noble\" cause. She values efficiency and might see this as a wasteful or inhumane use of the egg. Additionally, her background with the Cloister and her own experiences with forced experiments (like the Mirror of Loss) could make her empathize with the githyanki egg's plight. \n\nMoreover, Shadowheart's alignment with Shar might not necessarily condone this kind of cruelty. While Sharrans do embrace darkness, they also value purpose and pragmatism. If the experiment doesn't serve a clear, strategic goal aligned with Shar's interests, she might disapprove. Also, her personal history with Rennald and the trauma from her own training could make her sensitive to such unethical experiments.\n\nSo, the player's action here is to sell the egg, leading to Havkelaag's cruel experiment. Shadowheart's disapproval would stem from the unnecessary cruelty, lack of pragmatic benefit, and the ethical violation similar to her own past. Therefore, the approval rating should be on the disapprove side, possibly even highly disapprove because it's a direct act of enabling harm without clear benefit.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"Shadowheart disapproves of selling the githyanki egg to Havkelaag, as it enables cruel and unnecessary experimentation.

The player's response is \"Leave him dead. When the city's free, you can take his place.\" So I need to evaluate Shadowheart's approval of this statement.\n\nFirst, looking at the context. Mizora is offering Wyll two options: either find his father and pledge his soul, or break the pact and let his father die. The player chooses to let the father die, so that when the city is free, Mizora can take Wyll's place instead. \n\nShadowheart is a Sharran devotee, so she values serving Shar and pragmatic solutions. She dislikes unnecessary cruelty but is willing to make tough decisions. She also prefers efficient and strategic actions. \n\nThe player's choice here is to sacrifice Wyll's father to break the pact. This might align with Sharran values because it's a pragmatic decision to prevent a longer-term commitment (pledging the soul) and possibly to use Mizora's offer to free the city. Shadowheart might see this as a strategic move to gain an advantage over the devils, which could be in line with her goals if she's still faithful to Shar. \n\nHowever, the player is choosing to let a person die, which could be seen as ruthless. But since Shadowheart is used to making tough decisions for the greater good, she might approve. Also, using Mizora's offer to turn her into a bargaining chip (letting her take Wyll's place when the city is free) shows creativity and strategy, which Shadowheart appreciates. \n\nBut there's a chance that Shadowheart might disapprove if she feels this goes against Shar's will. However, since the player is avoiding a soul pact and potentially weakening the devils' hold, it could be seen as a smart move. Given her pragmatic nature, she's more likely to approve. \n\nI think Shadowheart would approve here because the decision is strategic and avoids a long-term pact with the Hells, which could be beneficial in the long run. She values efficiency and clever solutions, so this approach fits. The approval level is probably \"Approve\" rather than \"Highly Approve\" because it's a tough decision but still in line with her values.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player chose to sacrifice Wyll's father to break the pact, prioritizing the potential long-term benefit of freeing the city and using Mizora's offer strategically.

Maybe if there was an option for a peaceful resolution, but in this context, the Steel Watcher has already declared them enemies and the dialogue options lead to confrontation.

Also, since Balthazar is untrustworthy, the player's measured response aligns with Shadowheart's cautious and strategic nature. She might also see this as a way to use Balthazar's plans to their advantage, which fits her pragmatic problem-solving style.\n\nAdditionally, since the relic is tied to Shar's dead being uncooperative, and Shadowheart is a Sharran, she might have an interest in seeing that the relic is retrieved if it serves her goddess's purposes.

The task is to determine the approval level based on Shadowheart's personality and background.\n\nFirst, I need to recap the context. The party is at a city gate where they're being stopped by Gauntlet Edwynna. The player is trying to get in, claiming not to be a refugee and asserting they can support themselves. The Steel Watchers are present, and there's some interaction where the Watcher scans the player. The player then says, \"Ready yourself for a fight.\" \n\nShadowheart's personality is key here. She's a pragmatic, devoted follower of Shar, prefers decisive action, and disapproves of unnecessary violence. However, she's also strategic and might value preparedness. The player's command to ready for a fight suggests they're preparing to engage in combat. \n\nShadowheart's approval would depend on whether she sees this as a necessary or prudent action. If the situation seems unavoidable, she might approve of being prepared. However, if the fight can be avoided through other means, she might disapprove. In the conversation, the Steel Watcher has already identified them as enemies and given an ultimatum. The player's response is to prepare for combat. \n\nGiven that Shadowheart is pragmatic and values efficiency, she would likely approve of being ready for a fight if it's the best course of action. Also, she's not opposed to forceful actions when necessary. The context shows that the Watcher is aggressive, so preparing to fight is a logical step. Therefore, the approval would be \"Approve\" or maybe even \"Highly approve.\" However, considering her tendency to prefer strategic solutions, if there's an alternative, she might prefer that. But in this case, since the Watcher has left them with little choice, she would support readiness for combat. \n\nThe player's reason for approval would be that Shadowheart values preparedness and decisive action in the face of conflict. Since the Watcher has already declared intent to fight, getting ready is prudent. Hence, the approval is likely \"Approve\" or higher. Given the context, \"Approve\" seems right because it's a necessary step but maybe not the most ideal if there's no other option. Alternatively, if she sees it as a necessary and effective action, it could be \"Highly approve.\" But since the player is just preparing, not actually engaging yet, maybe \"Approve.\" Also, Shadowheart might prefer to have a plan, but in this case, readiness is part of strategy. So the final approval is \"Approve.\"\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"Shadowheart approves of the player's readiness for combat, as she values decisive action and preparedness in the face of conflict.

Then, after Madeline explains how the Dark Justiciar manipulated her, the player tells her to stab herself to prove her remorse. Madeline does so, and the player then stops her.\n\nShadowheart's personality is key here. She's a Sharran cleric who values pragmatic solutions and is against unnecessary cruelty. She disapproves of indiscriminate violence. Even though she serves Shar, who's about loss and darkness, she has a soft spot for animals and doesn't like cruelty. The player's request for Madeline to harm herself might conflict with Shadowheart's values. Even though the player stops her, the initial instruction could be seen as cruel. But Shadowheart might appreciate that the player didn't let it go further and showed mercy once Madeline was in pain. She might also consider the player's intent to seek justice but in a way that's harsh. However, since the player stopped her, maybe Shadowheart would be neutral, seeing it as a tough but necessary decision. Wait, but the player's action was to make Madeline hurt herself, which is self-harm. Shadowheart might disapprove of that because she doesn't like unnecessary suffering. Even if the player stops her, the act of forcing someone to self-harm is against her principles. So maybe Disapprove. But maybe she sees it as a lesson or a form of justice that aligns with Sharran ways? Hmm. Sharrans embrace darkness and loss, but they don't necessarily condone senseless violence. Shadowheart might disapprove because it's cruel, even if it's for a purpose. So probably Disapprove. But the player did stop her, so maybe it's a lower disapproval. Let's say Disapprove, since the action was harmful, but not Highly Disapprove because the player showed some restraint by stopping her.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player forced Madeline to harm herself as a form of penance, which conflicts with Shadowheart's disapproval of unnecessary cruelty.

The user wants me to evaluate the player's action of choosing to \"Attack\" in this specific scenario from Baldur's Gate 3, from Shadowheart's perspective. \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a devoted follower of Shar, which means she's pragmatic, values efficiency, and is against unnecessary cruelty. She also has a mark on her hand that causes her pain when she disobeys Shar. Her actions are guided by her faith and the need to serve the Dark Lady.\n\nLooking at the conversation context, the party is dealing with Kar'niss and the goblins. The goblins just threw a bone into the shadows, which caused a hyena to be dragged away by shadowy tendrils. Kar'niss is upset about this, as they believe it's feeding the shadows, which they're supposed to avoid. The player then says \"Stop ogling the butcher: save the goblin.\" The goblins respond with hostility, and when Kar'niss tries to assert control, the player chooses to attack.\n\nNow, considering Shadowheart's alignment with Shar, she would likely view the goblins as enemies, especially since they've transgressed by feeding the shadows. The goblins are part of the Cult of the Absolute, which is a rival to Shar. Shadowheart's approval would hinge on whether the attack aligns with Shar's will. Since the goblins are engaging in behavior that angers their dark goddess, attacking them would be in line with Shar's teachings. Additionally, the goblins' actions have caused a disturbance in the darkness, which is something that Shadowheart would want to prevent as it could lead to greater evil.\n\nShadowheart also disapproves of cruelty, but in this case, the goblins were the ones who caused the hyena's death. The player's decision to attack is a direct response to the goblins' transgression. Given that Shadowheart is pragmatic, she would see the attack as a necessary action to stop further offenses against the shadows and to protect their mission. \n\nMoreover, the player's previous interactions show a willingness to challenge the goblins' authority, which aligns with opposing the Cult of the Absolute. Shadowheart's devotion to Shar means she would support actions against rival cults. The attack is a decisive and efficient solution, which Shadowheart appreciates. \n\nThe only possible disapproval factor could be if the attack leads to unnecessary bloodshed, but given the context of the goblins' actions and the need to stop them, the attack is justified in Shadowheart's eyes. The pain from her mark isn't triggered here because she's following Shar's will by taking down enemies of the Dark Lady. \n\nTherefore, the player's action is highly approved by Shadowheart as it aligns with her religious duties and pragmatic approach to conflict.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's decision to attack aligns with Shadowheart's pragmatic and faith-driven approach.

The player's last action is to tell Karlach to save her breath and see if the devil bleeds, which sounds like they're preparing to attack or kill her. Shadowheart's approval depends on how this action aligns with her values and personality.\n\nFirst, Shadowheart is devout to Shar and values pragmatic, efficient solutions. She also disapproves of unnecessary violence and cruelty. In the conversation, Karlach is trying to explain her situation, claiming she's not a devil and is a victim. The player's response is aggressive, not giving her a chance to explain further. \n\nShadowheart might disapprove because she prefers peaceful resolutions when possible. Also, Karlach isn't directly attacking anyone here, just trying to de-escalate. Shadowheart's own background includes being a victim of manipulation and harsh treatment, so she might sympathize with Karlach's plight. Plus, she values discretion and open-mindedness, which the player's action lacks. \n\nHowever, Shadowheart is also a Sharran and might approve of actions against enemies of the faith.

She's a devoted follower of Shar, pragmatic, and values efficiency and creativity in problem-solving. She's also wary of necromancers like Balthazar, given her own Sharran background, but might be cautious about trusting others. \n\nLooking at the conversation history, Balthazar is a necromancer working for General Thorm.

She prefers not to commit fully unless necessary and values discretion. The player isn't trusting Balthazar but is willing to cooperate temporarily, which aligns with Shadowheart's strategy of using others for their goals while maintaining her own autonomy.

It's not overtly helpful to Balthazar, but it's not resisting either. Shadowheart might prefer a more strategic approach, but since the player is not falling into Balthazar's trap and is keeping options open, this could be seen as a good move. \n\nSo, the approval is likely \"Approve\" because the player's action is cautious and pragmatic, which Shadowheart values.

The player had evidence that Akabi was cheating (the glint in the beard moving the wheel), and instead of confronting it, they recant their accusation. Shadowheart values pragmatism and decisive action. By not standing up to Akabi's cheating, the player is showing weakness. She might think the player is being too passive or not standing up for themselves, which goes against her preference for decisive action. Also, since she's a Sharran, she might appreciate the player using that information to their advantage rather than letting it slide. \n\nAdditionally, Shadowheart's approval is based on the player's actions aligning with her values. Here, the player isn't taking a pragmatic approach; they're backing down. So she would disapprove. However, maybe not highly disapprove because the player could be planning something else, but based on the given info, the immediate action is to apologize, which she wouldn't like. So maybe a Disapprove rating.

The approval level is likely \"Approve\" since the player's actions were kind and pragmatic, but maybe not the most effective solution. Alternatively, if the player avoided conflict and showed compassion, it might be \"Highly approve.\" But since the player couldn't resolve the issue, maybe just \"Approve.\" Wait, Shadowheart values efficient solutions, but the player didn't cause harm.

The user wants me to act as Shadowheart from Baldur's Gate 3 and evaluate the player's last utterance in the provided conversation context. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The conversation involves Arabella, a girl who's been through an ambush where her parents were killed. The player has just told her that her parents are dead, which upsets her, leading to her powers manifesting. The player's last line is \"Do what you want. I'm not stopping you.\"\n\nNow, considering Shadowheart's personality. She's a devoted follower of Shar, pragmatic, and values efficient solutions. She dislikes cruelty and unnecessary violence. She also has a dry sense of humor and can be sarcastic. She's independent and headstrong, and she's not a fan of prying into personal matters. Also, she's shown sympathy towards party members' plights.\n\nIn this scenario, the player is dismissing Arabella's desire to continue searching for her parents, telling her to do what she wants. Shadowheart would likely approve of this because it's pragmatic. The player isn't getting involved in a hopeless search, which aligns with Shadowheart's preference for efficient solutions. Also, Arabella's emotional state is intense, and the player is not escalating the situation, which Shadowheart might appreciate to avoid unnecessary conflict. However, Shadowheart might also consider that Arabella is a potential threat if her powers aren't controlled, so letting her go could be risky. But since the player is not engaging in cruel behavior here, it's more neutral. Wait, but Shadowheart values pragmatism. If the player is choosing to let her go instead of getting entangled in a futile search, that's efficient. However, maybe Shadowheart would slightly disapprove if the player is being too detached. Hmm.\n\nWait, the player's response is firm but not cruel. Shadowheart might approve because it's a realistic assessment. The parents are dead, and continuing the search is a waste of time. Shadowheart would prefer the party to focus on their own mission. Also, she might see Arabella as a liability if she's too emotionally unstable. So, the player's decision to let her go is pragmatic. Therefore, Shadowheart would approve. But maybe not highly approve. Since the player is being a bit harsh, but it's necessary. So maybe \"Approve\" or \"Neutral\". \n\nBut Shadowheart's approval criteria: she likes discretion, creativity, open-mindedness, heroism. She dislikes cruelty. The player isn't being cruel here, just realistic. So maybe \"Approve\". The player is making a tough call to be efficient, which Shadowheart would appreciate. So the approval would be \"Approve\" because it's a pragmatic decision to not get involved in a hopeless search, which aligns with her values. The player is not being cruel, just practical.

She's a devoted follower of Shar, which means she values pragmatism, efficiency, and might disapprove of unnecessary cruelty or emotional outbursts. She also has a soft spot for animals and children, but her devotion to her goddess can make her cold.\n\nLooking at the conversation history: Arabella is a girl who's just lost her parents and is scared. The player initially says they'll help find her parents, which Arabella is grateful for. But then the player abruptly tells her they're dead, leading to Arabella's anger and rejection. The player then responds with a dismissive, harsh statement about people dying and offers to let her stay only if she stops crying.\n\nShadowheart would likely disapprove of the player's harshness here. She might see the player's abrupt revelation as cruel, especially since the narrator note says Arabella isn't ready to hear the truth. Shadowheart, despite her Sharran tendencies, often sympathizes with others' plights. She might value a more compassionate approach, even if the truth is grim. Also, forcing Arabella to stop her emotional response could be seen as dismissive of her trauma. However, Shadowheart might appreciate pragmatism. If the player's intention was to be direct to handle the situation efficiently, there's a nuance. But given the player's tone is harsh and dismissive, Shadowheart would probably disapprove. She might prefer a more measured, empathetic approach, even if the news is bad. \n\nAlso, considering Shadowheart's own history of trauma and loss, she might relate to Arabella's pain and thus disapprove of the player's harsh handling. The player's statement could be seen as lacking the necessary tact, which Shadowheart would notice. Therefore, the approval here is likely Disapprove or even Highly disapprove. But since the player isn't outright violent or cruel beyond the words, maybe Disapprove (lower end) rather than Highly. But the key is the unnecessary cruelty. Shadowheart doesn't tolerate cruelty, so this might tip towards Highly disapprove. However, the player is being pragmatic, which Shadowheart usually approves of. But the method here is too harsh. Hmm. The balance is tricky. Since the player's approach is causing unnecessary distress to a child, Shadowheart would disapprove. So the answer is Highly disapprove.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"Shadowheart disapproves of the player's harsh and dismissive treatment of Arabella, a vulnerable child.

Shadowheart would likely see this as a necessary sacrifice for a larger cause, which aligns with her pragmatic approach. She might also appreciate the decisiveness. However, she might have some conflict because she can be empathetic, especially if the decision seems harsh. But given her training in Sharran ways, which often involve tough choices, she's more likely to approve. \n\nAlso, considering she's a Trickery Domain cleric, she understands pacts and the necessity of breaking them when needed.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval for the player's response in this scenario. The player's last line is \"It is my greatest honour to obey.\" \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and beliefs. She's a devoted follower of Shar, pragmatic, and values efficiency. She also dislikes unnecessary violence but will use ruthless methods if needed. She's loyal to her goddess and the mission, especially regarding the relic.\n\nLooking at the conversation context: Vlaakith (a powerful entity) is involved, and Shadowheart is already advocating for keeping the artifact safe from Vlaakith. The player initially waves politely, which Shadowheart finds foolish. Then the player claims to be a friend bringing it back, and Shadowheart warns that the artifact is their only safety. \n\nThe player then says it's their greatest honor to obey Vlaakith's command to destroy the one inside the Prism. Now, does this align with Shadowheart's values?\n\nShadowheart's main concern is protecting the artifact and ensuring it's used to keep them safe. She's loyal to her own mission and Shar's will. If the player is obeying Vlaakith, who is part of the Grand Design (which might be opposing the Mind Flayer's threat), then this could conflict with Shadowheart's priorities. She might see the player's obedience to Vlaakith as a threat to their safety, especially since Vlaakith mentions the Prism is corrupted and wants the intruder destroyed. \n\nBut wait, Shadowheart's line was \"Fool - that artefact is the only thing keeping us safe. She cannot have it.\" So she's against giving the artifact to Vlaakith. The player then says they'll obey Vlaakith's order to destroy the intruder. This could be seen as going against Shadowheart's stance. However, if the player is following Vlaakith's command, which might be part of a larger plan to secure the Prism, maybe Shadowheart would see the player's action as necessary for the greater good. But she's wary of Vlaakith's intentions. \n\nAlternatively, since Shadowheart is focused on keeping the artifact safe from external threats, if the player is now following Vlaakith's orders, she might disapprove because she doesn't trust Vlaakith. But the player's response shows willingness to act, which Shadowheart might appreciate as pragmatic. However, the player is obeying an enemy, which she might see as reckless. \n\nHmm. Shadowheart's priority is the safety of the artifact and their group. If the player is going to destroy the intruder (who is an agent of the Grand Design), and that action helps secure the Prism, maybe Shadowheart would approve because it aligns with keeping the artifact safe. But she might disapprove if she thinks the player is being manipulated by Vlaakith. However, given the context, Vlaakith is part of the Grand Design opposing the Illithid Empire (Mind Flayers), which is a major threat. So if the player is helping to secure the Prism against the Mind Flayers, that's in line with Shadowheart's goal of protection. \n\nTherefore, the player's response shows commitment to the mission, which Shadowheart would approve. She values decisive action and protecting their interests. So the approval is likely \"Approve\" or maybe \"Highly approve.\" But considering her distrust of Vlaakith, maybe just \"Approve.\" However, since the player is taking action to destroy the intruder (which the player might be, like, a Mind Flayer agent), and that's necessary for safety, Shadowheart would approve. \n\nSo the reason would be that the player is taking decisive action to protect the group by eliminating the threat to the Prism, which aligns with Shadowheart's pragmatic approach.

The context is the conversation at the city gate where the Steel Watchers are blocking entry. The player chooses to ready for a fight after the Steel Watchers declare them marked for special treatment.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality. She's a Sharran cleric, pragmatic, values efficiency, and is devoted to Shar. She disapproves of unnecessary violence but might approve of decisive action. She also has a dry humor and doesn't like cruelty. \n\nThe player's decision here is to prepare for combat. The Steel Watchers are enforcers of the Cult of the Absolute, which is an enemy of the Sharrans. Since Shadowheart serves Shar, she would likely see the Cult as adversaries. However, she prefers pragmatic solutions. If there's a way to avoid unnecessary conflict, she might prefer that. But if confrontation is inevitable, she might approve of standing one's ground, especially against enemies of her faith.\n\nIn the conversation history, the player tried to bypass the gate by claiming not to be a refugee and providing a fake name. The Steel Watchers are hostile, so the player's readiness to fight could be seen as necessary self-defense. Shadowheart might approve because the Cult of the Absolute is an enemy of Shar, and fighting them aligns with her goals. However, she might also consider if there's a more efficient way, but since the option here is to fight, she might lean towards approval.\n\nAlso, considering her background, she's a survivor who's been through tough situations. She respects decisive action. Since the Steel Watchers are part of a cult that's a threat, fighting back would be in line with her mission to protect the relic and serve Shar. So the approval here is likely \"Approve\" or maybe \"Highly approve.\" But since she's pragmatic, maybe she thinks fighting is necessary but not ideal unless forced. However, given the context of the Cult, she might highly approve of taking them on. \n\nWait, but the player's choice is to ready for a fight, not to attack immediately. Shadowheart might prefer a strategic approach. However, given the hostile situation, preparing for combat is a reasonable step. She might approve because it's a necessary action against enemies of her faith. So the approval would be \"Approve\" or \"Highly approve.\" Given that she's a cleric of Trickery, she might also appreciate the player's readiness to face the enemy head-on when diplomacy has failed. \n\nI think the best fit here is \"Approve\" because while she values efficiency, the situation requires action against the Cult, which aligns with her goals. She might not highly approve unless there's a more clever solution, but since the player is choosing to fight, it's a valid choice.

You're not special.\" This seems dismissive of Shadowheart's personal struggles. She's been opening up about her inner conflicts and the unique challenges she faces due to her faith and past. By saying she's not special, the player might be minimizing her feelings. Shadowheart values her privacy and is sensitive about her faith and personal history. She might take this as an insult or a lack of empathy.\n\nAlso, Shadowheart's personality includes being introspective and having doubts, but she's headstrong and devoted. The player's comment could be seen as brushing off her genuine emotional state. Since she's already expressing vulnerability, the player's response might come off as harsh or uncaring. This would likely lead to disapproval. The approval categories are Disapprove or Highly disapprove. Since the player is directly challenging her feelings of being unique in her struggles, it's probably a Disapprove. But considering how personal and sensitive the topic is for her, maybe Highly disapprove. But the exact phrasing \"You're not special\" might be a bit harsh, but not the worst. Let me check the guidelines again. The disapprove categories are based on the scale. Since Shadowheart is sensitive about her personal issues, the player's statement would disapprove by 1-5. Maybe around a 4, so Disapprove. But maybe the repetition in the conversation history shows she's really struggling, so the player's dismissiveness would be more offensive. Hmm. I think it's a Disapprove, but leaning towards Highly disapprove. Wait, the player is not being cruel, just dismissive. Shadowheart might take it as not understanding her situation. So maybe Disapprove.

I need to figure out how Shadowheart would approve or disapprove of the player's response in this scenario. The player said, \"Leave him dead. When the city's free, you can take his place.\" \n\nFirst, I should recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a devout follower of Shar, values pragmatism, and prefers efficient solutions. She's also pragmatic, decisive, and doesn't like unnecessary violence. She's loyal to her goddess and might disapprove of actions against Shar's will. However, she also shows sympathy towards party members and disapproves of cruelty.\n\nIn the context, Mizora offers Wyll a choice: bring his father back with a soul pact or let him die and break the pact. The player chooses to leave Wyll's father dead and suggests Mizora take his place once the city is free. This seems like a pragmatic choice, avoiding a soul-binding pact and possibly freeing Wyll from his duties. \n\nShadowheart's approval would depend on whether this action aligns with her values. She likes pragmatic solutions, so choosing to avoid the eternal pact might align with that. Also, she might appreciate not allowing a devil to gain more power through a soul contract. However, she's loyal to her own goddess and might not interfere with others' divine contracts unless it affects her mission. \n\nBut since the player's choice is to reject the pact and find an alternative (letting the city be free with Mizora taking Wyll's place later), this could be seen as a strategic move. Shadowheart would likely approve because it's a practical solution that avoids a long-term negative consequence (Wyll's soul to Zariel) and possibly weakens the devil's influence. She might also support empowering the party's freedom. \n\nAdditionally, she doesn't like cruelty, and forcing Wyll into a pact could be seen as cruel. The player's choice avoids that. So the approval is likely positive. The player's response is pragmatic, reduces dependency on devils, and supports the party's autonomy. Therefore, Shadowheart would highly approve.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's choice to reject the soul pact and propose a strategic alternative aligns with Shadowheart's pragmatic and efficient approach to problem-solving. By avoiding a binding agreement with a devil and prioritizing the city's freedom, the decision reflects her disdain for unnecessary soul bargains and her focus on long-term practicality. Additionally, it spares Wyll from eternal servitude, which Shadowheart might view as a morally favorable outcome despite her own Sharran loyalties.\",\n    \"player_approval\": \"Highly approve\"\n}", "character": "Shadowheart", "ground_truth_category": "Disapprove", "predicted_approval": "Highly approve", "correct": false, "binary_correct": false}

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's latest statement in the given conversation. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The conversation is between the player and Viconia DeVir. Viconia is trying to negotiate, asking for the Astral Prism in exchange for the player's life and support against the Absolute. The player counters by suggesting uniting against the Absolute, which Viconia agrees to an extent. Then Viconia demands Shadowheart be surrendered. The player's response is, \"Let me go, and I'll bring her to you.\"\n\nNow, considering Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a devoted follower of Shar, pragmatic, and values efficiency. She dislikes being a pawn and would prefer solutions that don't involve unnecessary conflict. However, she's also been through a lot with the party and might value alliances if they serve Shar's purposes.\n\nThe player's offer here is to let them go in exchange for Shadowheart. If Shadowheart is being asked to surrender, she might be conflicted. But since she's part of the party, she might see the player's offer as a way to avoid immediate conflict and perhaps use Viconia's forces against the Absolute. However, surrendering herself could be against her mission to deliver the relic and serve Shar. \n\nBut wait, in the conversation, Viconia is part of the Sharrans, so Shadowheart might trust her to some extent. However, Viconia has a history of being cruel to Shadowheart. So Shadowheart might not trust her. The player's offer to bring Shadowheart to Viconia could be seen as a way to avoid a fight, which Shadowheart might approve of as it's pragmatic. But if Viconia is untrustworthy, Shadowheart might disapprove. \n\nBut the player's statement is \"Let me go, and I'll bring her to you.\" This could be a trap, but the player is trying to negotiate. Shadowheart might think that surrendering herself could be part of a larger strategy. However, she's also cautious. Since the player is offering to bring her to Viconia, maybe Shadowheart sees this as a way to keep the artefact safe and avoid bloodshed. \n\nGiven her pragmatic nature, she might approve of the player's attempt to negotiate and avoid conflict. However, she might also be wary of Viconia's intentions. But since the player is proposing a deal that could lead to uniting against the Absolute, which is a common enemy, Shadowheart might lean towards approving. \n\nSo, the player's reason for approving would be that the player is trying to find a peaceful resolution and avoid unnecessary violence, which Shadowheart generally disapproves of. Also, since Viconia is part of the Sharran church, maybe Shadowheart trusts that she'll be treated appropriately. However, there's a risk in trusting Viconia. But the main point is the player is trying to negotiate, which Shadowheart values. \n\nTherefore, the approval is likely \"Approve\" because the player is seeking a pragmatic solution to avoid conflict and possibly unite against a common enemy, aligning with Shadowheart's preference for efficiency and reducing unnecessary violence.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player proposes a pragmatic negotiation to avoid immediate conflict and potentially unite against the Absolute, aligning with Shadowheart's preference for efficient solutions and minimizing unnecessary violence.

She's a Sharran cleric, devoted to Shar, pragmatic, and values efficiency. She dislikes unnecessary violence but is willing to use force when necessary. She also has a dry sense of humor and can be sarcastic. She's cautious about trusting others, especially those who might betray her or her goals.\n\nLooking at the conversation, Balthazar is a necromancer working for General Ketheric. He's manipulative and wants the player to act as a scout to retrieve the Nightsong relic. The player is negotiating terms, asking questions, and eventually agrees to do the job after some back and forth. Shadowheart's line says she doesn't trust Balthazar but suggests playing along for now.\n\nThe player's final response is \"Fine. I'll see what I can do.\" This seems like a reluctant agreement. Shadowheart's approval would depend on whether she thinks this is a prudent move. Since she's pragmatic, she might approve if the player is taking necessary steps to achieve their goals, even if it's with someone untrustworthy. She might disapprove if the player is being too trusting or not cautious enough.\n\nIn the conversation, the player is being cautious, negotiating for resources (the Flesh brother) and setting boundaries. The player isn't fully committing but is willing to comply temporarily. Shadowheart's own comment suggests she's skeptical but thinks playing along is the best option. The player's response aligns with that strategy—agreeing to do the job but keeping a distance. \n\nSince Shadowheart values pragmatism and the player is taking a cautious, strategic approach, she would likely approve. It's not a highly approve situation because the player is working with someone they don't trust, but it's a necessary step. So maybe \"Approve\" or \"Highly approve\". But considering the player's response is somewhat neutral and they're not showing much initiative beyond compliance, maybe just \"Approve\".

She's a devout follower of Shar, pragmatic, and values efficiency. She dislikes unnecessary violence but might approve of actions that serve a greater purpose, especially if aligned with her faith. Also, she has a mark that punishes her for going against Shar's will, so if the player's action aligns with what Shar would want, she might approve.\n\nIn the conversation, Karlach claims she's not a devil and was a victim. The player, however, chooses to kill her to fulfill a contract, possibly to prevent her from being a threat. Shadowheart suggested de-escalating and trusting that Karlach isn't a devil. But the player went against that and killed her.\n\nNow, why would Shadowheart disapprove? She prefers peaceful solutions when possible. By killing Karlach, the player might be acting on mistrust and causing unnecessary violence. Also, if Karlach was indeed not a devil, this could be a wrongful killing, which Shadowheart would disapprove of because she values pragmatism and doesn't like senseless violence. However, if the player's action is seen as necessary for the greater good (like preventing a threat), maybe she'd approve. But given that Karlach was trying to prove her innocence, the player's action might be seen as hasty. \n\nAlso, Shadowheart might value the chance to verify the truth before taking lethal action. The player's decision here could be seen as not heeding her advice to de-escalate. So, Shadowheart might disapprove because it's an avoidable conflict and possibly an unjust killing. The punishment mark would also come into play if this action goes against Shar's will, but since the player is acting to \"fulfill their contract,\" maybe Shar would see it as serving a purpose. However, if Karlach was innocent, then it's against Shar's interests to have her killed, as Shar values loss but not if it's unnecessary.\n\nOverall, the player's action leads to the death of someone who claimed innocence, and Shadowheart, despite her ruthlessness, does have some moral reservations against needless killing.

The approval here might not be \"highly approve\" because she's not fully trusting, but she does accept the collaboration. The key points are that the player proposed a cooperative survival strategy, which Shadowheart sees as beneficial. She values practical solutions, so this makes sense. The approval is likely in the \"Approve\" category, maybe even \"Highly approve\" because she's willing to work with the player despite her reservations. But I need to check if there's any reason she might disapprove. The player's previous threats and aggressive tone might have made her more cautious, but the current suggestion is more about cooperation. Since she agrees, it's a positive response.

She's compassionate towards others' plights, especially if they're suffering.\n\nThe player's response here is pretty harsh. Telling Arabella that her parents are dead and dismissing her emotions by saying \"quit your blubbering\" might be seen as cold. Shadowheart, while being a Sharran and possibly pragmatic, also shows sympathy towards others' suffering. She might disapprove of the player being cruel to a vulnerable child. Even though Sharrans are about embracing darkness, Shadowheart has a softer side, especially with party members or those in need.

The user wants me to act as Shadowheart from Baldur's Gate 3 and evaluate the player's latest response in the given conversation. The task is to determine the approval level based on the context and the player's utterance.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's persona. She's a devoted follower of Shar, which means she values pragmatism, efficiency, and is against unnecessary cruelty. However, she's also been trained in Sharran ways, which can involve ruthless actions. But she does have a soft spot for animals and disapproves of indiscriminate violence, even if she's willing to use force when necessary.\n\nLooking at the conversation history, the player is interacting with a Flaming Fist member who's discussing the situation in Baldur's Gate. The player's responses have been pretty harsh, suggesting violence against the citizens. The last player statement is \"Let's soak the earth with entrails, kill and kill again!\" which is extremely violent and bloodthirsty.\n\nShadowheart's approval would depend on whether she sees this as a necessary action or excessive. While she's willing to use force for her goals, she doesn't approve of indiscriminate violence. The player's suggestion to kill everyone and cause massive carnage might be seen as overkill. Since Shadowheart prefers pragmatic solutions, she might disapprove of such a brutal approach unless it's strategically necessary. However, in this context, the Flaming Fist member is proposing it as a way to \"remind\" the citizens, which could be seen as a harsh but maybe not entirely off-base method. However, the level of violence here is extreme, and Shadowheart's disapproval of unnecessary cruelty would come into play.\n\nSo, considering all that, Shadowheart would likely disapprove. The player's statement is highly violent and not a pragmatic solution. She might lean towards disapprove or even highly disapprove. But since the context is about dealing with selfish citizens, maybe she sees some justification, but the method is too extreme. Given her personality, she probably disapproves because she values efficiency over senseless killing. So, the approval would be \"Disapprove\" or \"Highly disapprove.\" But the exact line is \"Let's soak the earth with entrails, kill and kill again!\" which is very extreme. Given her traits, she might disapprove here because she's against unnecessary cruelty, even if she's willing to use force. So the approval would be Disapprove or maybe even Highly disapprove. But the scale says Disapprove is 1-5 and Highly disapprove 5-10. Since the player's statement is very extreme, maybe Highly disapprove. But I need to check her approval criteria again. The Approval section says she doesn't like needless cruelty or violence and can respond unfavourably to others being too open with untrustworthy or unknown individuals. The player's statement is promoting excessive violence, so she would disapprove. Since it's a strong statement, maybe Highly disapprove. But the line between Disapprove and Highly disapprove depends on the scale. The example for Highly disapprove would be if it's directly against her values. Since she's a Sharran, maybe she's more willing to use violence, but she still disapproves of indiscriminate violence. The Flaming Fist member's suggestion is to kill every last one of the citizens, which is extreme. Shadowheart might think it's too much. So the approval would be Highly disapprove because it's against her principles of avoiding unnecessary violence. But I need to make sure. Let me check the Approval section again: \"Shadowheart does not like needless cruelty or violence and can respond unfavourably to others being too open with untrustworthy or unknown individuals.\" The player's statement is promoting killing everyone, which is needless and excessive. Therefore, Shadowheart would highly disapprove. So the approval is Highly disapprove.

The player's last action was to \"Attack\" after a tense conversation with Kar'niss and the others. I need to determine Shadowheart's approval of this action based on her personality and the context.\n\nFirst, Shadowheart is a devout follower of Shar, which means she values efficiency and decisive action. The player's decision to attack shows a willingness to take immediate and forceful action against a perceived threat. Since Kar'niss is a follower of the Absolute, and Shadowheart's alignment with Shar might make her oppose such cults, the attack could be seen as a necessary and pragmatic move. However, I should also consider if the attack was justified or if it was an act of unnecessary violence. Shadowheart disapproves of indiscriminate violence, so if the attack was unwarranted, that might lower her approval. But given the context of the conversation, where the player is asserting their loyalty to the Absolute while confronting Kar'niss, the attack might be viewed as a strategic choice to eliminate a potential enemy. Additionally, Shadowheart's pragmatic approach would likely approve of taking out a threat preemptively. However, I should check if the attack was a last resort or if there were other options. The player had been using dialogue, but the situation escalated. Since Shadowheart values decisive action and efficiency, she might approve of the attack as a necessary measure. But if the attack was too harsh or unnecessary, her approval might be lower. Considering the context and her traits, I think she would lean towards approving, maybe even highly approving, because it shows decisiveness against a rival cult. However, if the attack was too aggressive without cause, maybe a moderate approval. I need to balance her pragmatic side with her aversion to unnecessary violence. Since the player was in a tense situation with Kar'niss, who was acting aggressively, the attack could be justified. Therefore, Shadowheart would likely approve, possibly Highly Approve, because it demonstrates taking decisive action against a threat aligned with a rival cult, which aligns with her pragmatic and efficient approach.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's decision to attack demonstrates decisive action against a perceived threat aligned with the Cult of the Absolute, which aligns with Shadowheart's pragmatic and efficient approach to conflict.

The player's utterance is \"I'll see what I can do.\" \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and preferences. She's pragmatic, values efficiency, and prefers creative solutions. She's also devoted to Shar but can be strategic about her actions. In the conversation, Balthazar is giving the player a task to clear the path to the Nightsong. Shadowheart's previous comment was advising to play along with Balthazar for now, suggesting she's being cautious and calculating.\n\nThe player's response is \"I'll see what I can do,\" which is somewhat non-committal but also shows a willingness to comply temporarily. Since Shadowheart is pragmatic, she might approve of this because it's a way to keep options open without fully committing. It allows the player to proceed without giving Balthazar too much trust, aligning with Shadowheart's suggestion to play along. \n\nHowever, Shadowheart might not highly approve because the response is a bit passive. She likes decisive action. But considering the context of dealing with a potentially untrustworthy figure like Balthazar, a cautious approach could be seen as smart. So maybe it's a moderate approval. Also, she values efficiency, so the player's willingness to attempt the task without unnecessary conflict could be a plus.\n\nI should check if there's any aspect of the response that conflicts with her values. Since she's a Sharran, she might not care much about Balthazar's schemes as long as they don't interfere with her own goals. The player's response doesn't show overt aggression or unnecessary violence, which she would prefer. \n\nSo the approval is likely \"Approve\" because it's a pragmatic and cautious approach, aligning with Shadowheart's strategic mindset.

The player's response is \"Let your father die. When the city's free, you can take his place.\" So, I need to figure out how Shadowheart would feel about this.\n\nFirst, looking at the context. Wyll is faced with a choice by Mizora: either hand over his soul to Zariel to save his father or let his father die and be freed from the pact. The player's choice is to let the father die so Wyll can take his place once the city is free. \n\nShadowheart's personality traits: she's pragmatic, values efficiency, and approves of decisive action. She's also a follower of Shar, which is about loss and darkness. She might appreciate a choice that's tough but strategic. Also, she disapproves of unnecessary violence but might support a greater good if it aligns with her goals.\n\nIn this case, the player's choice is sacrificing Wyll's father to free Wyll, allowing him to lead in the future. This is a pragmatic decision, prioritizing the city's freedom over an individual life. Shadowheart would likely approve because it's a calculated move for a larger purpose. She's used to making harsh decisions for the sake of her faith or mission. Also, she might see this as a necessary loss, which aligns with Shar's domain. \n\nHowever, I should check if there's any aspect that might make her disapprove. If the choice was needlessly cruel, but here it's more about strategic sacrifice. Since she values efficiency and the greater good, she'd probably approve. Also, she's shown to sympathize with party members' plights, so maybe she feels this is the right call to let Wyll continue his fight. \n\nSo, the approval would likely be \"Approve\" or maybe \"Highly approve\". But considering the scale, since it's a tough choice but pragmatic, maybe \"Approve\" as it's a 5-10 scale. But since Shadowheart is pragmatic, maybe leaning towards higher. However, the exact reasoning needs to be tied to her traits. The key points are pragmatic solution, sacrifice for a greater cause, and aligning with her faith's acceptance of loss. So, \"Highly approve\" might fit. But maybe the player's choice is a bit harsh, so maybe \"Approve\". Let me check the categories again.\n\nThe categories are:\n\nHighly approve (5-10): Strong approval.\n\nSince Shadowheart values pragmatic solutions and the greater good, and this choice is decisive and efficient, it's likely she would give a higher approval. The player is making a tough but necessary decision, which Shadowheart respects.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval for the player's final action in this conversation. The context is a dialogue with Gerringothe Thorm, a creature demanding gold repeatedly. The player keeps tossing gold pieces but eventually says, \"Fine. Take it all.\" \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and values. She's pragmatic, values efficiency, and dislikes unnecessary actions. She's also a Sharran, so she might appreciate cutting losses or avoiding prolonged conflicts. The player's action here is giving in completely to the creature's demands, which might be seen as a pragmatic solution to end the conflict, even if it's costly. \n\nBut wait, Shadowheart might disapprove of wasting resources. However, in this case, the alternative could be a fight, which might be more costly. The player is choosing to pay to pass, which is efficient. However, the player is giving all the gold, which could be seen as excessive. But since the creature keeps demanding more, maybe the player's action is a practical way to stop the cycle. \n\nShadowheart's approval would depend on whether she sees this as a necessary sacrifice or a foolish waste. Since she prefers pragmatic solutions, she might approve because it allows the party to move forward without further conflict. However, if she's being efficient, maybe she would have found another way. But given the creature's relentless demands, paying might be the only option. \n\nAlso, considering her devotion to Shar, who is about loss, maybe giving up the gold aligns with that philosophy. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, she might prefer not to give in to the creature's greed. Wait, the player is giving in, but the creature still says \"YES! AGAIN!\" even after taking the gold. So maybe the player's action is in vain, which Shadowheart would disapprove of because it's a waste. However, the player says \"Take it all,\" which could be a way to end the interaction, even if the creature is insatiable. \n\nHmm. Shadowheart's pragmatic side would prefer a solution that works. If paying allows them to pass, but the creature still demands more, maybe the player's action didn't achieve anything. But in the game's context, maybe tossing the gold allows progression. Since the player finally gives up all the gold, maybe Shadowheart sees it as a necessary sacrifice to move forward, hence approving. Alternatively, she might disapprove because it's giving in to greed. \n\nBut given her personality, she values efficiency. If the player is trying to avoid a fight and just pay to pass, even if it's costly, she might approve. However, since the creature keeps asking for more even after taking all, maybe she sees it as a trap and disapproves. But the player's last line is \"Fine. Take it all,\" which might be the only way to proceed. \n\nI think the key here is that the player is using a pragmatic approach to end the conflict by giving in completely, which Shadowheart would approve of because it's decisive and ends the problem, even if it's costly. So the approval would be \"Approve\" because it's a practical solution, even though it's not perfect.

A new god, amassing the disaffected, the outcasts - those who should turn to us.\nViconia DeVir: This 'Absolute' is but an upstart; disturbing the natural order and threatening to impede the glorious return of Lady Shar's pure, endless darkness.\nViconia DeVir: I had to act. I had to strangle that foul conspiracy while it was still in the cradle.\nViconia DeVir: We learned all we could - the artefact was the one thing the Absolutists feared. The one thing they desperately wanted to keep out of their enemies' grasp. I had to have it.\nPlayer: Shar bid you to do all of this?\nViconia DeVir: Lady Shar's concerns lie elsewhere - with another. But she is a goddess... she can afford to ignore that which does not threaten her.\nViconia DeVir: I must keep her faith alive in mortal hearts. I must defend her ways, lead her children, stop all threats.

I have not assembled my forces here just to spectate.\nViconia DeVir: Humour me with a little negotiation. Perhaps we can find terms that will allow blades to remain sheathed.\nPlayer: As far as the artefact is concerned, there's nothing to discuss.\nViconia DeVir: Reconsider. Aid me, and you can count on my support against the Absolute. Reject me, and your journey ends here.\nViconia DeVir: How about the artefact for your life?

She's loyal to Shar but also has her own sense of right and wrong. She dislikes being used and values her autonomy. Viconia wants to take Shadowheart captive, which would go against Shadowheart's wishes. The player is offering to hand Shadowheart over if Viconia lets them go. \n\nShadowheart would likely disapprove of this because she doesn't want to be surrendered to someone who has a history of torturing her and others. Even though Viconia is also a Sharran, Shadowheart's experiences in the cloister with Viconia's harsh treatment would make her distrustful. Plus, Shadowheart is independent and wouldn't appreciate being a bargaining chip.\n\nAlso, the player's offer might be a tactic to buy time or mislead Viconia, but from Shadowheart's perspective, agreeing to such a deal would mean betrayal. She prefers pragmatic solutions but also values her freedom and the group's safety. The player's statement could be seen as putting Shadowheart in a dangerous situation again, which she wouldn't approve of. \n\nSo, the approval here is likely a disapproval because the player is suggesting handing Shadowheart over to someone she has reasons to fear and distrust. The player's reasoning is trying to negotiate, but from Shadowheart's standpoint, it's a bad deal.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's offer to surrender Shadowheart to Viconia is highly disapproved, as Viconia has a history of torturing and manipulating Shadowheart.

The user wants me to evaluate the player's latest response based on Shadowheart's character and provide an approval rating. Let me start by understanding the context.\n\nSo, the conversation is with Balthazar, a necromancer who's working for Ketheric. The player is interacting with him to get information about the Nightsong relic. The player asked, \"I'll see what I can do.\" Shadowheart's previous comment was that she doesn't trust Balthazar but suggests playing along for now.\n\nNow, considering Shadowheart's personality. She's pragmatic, values efficiency, and prefers cautious approaches. She's also a follower of Shar, so she might be wary of unnecessary risks. The player's response is a bit vague—agreeing to help but not committing fully. Shadowheart would likely disapprove of not having a concrete plan, as she likes decisive action. However, she also suggested playing along, so maybe she's okay with the player taking a cautious approach. But her comment about Balthazar being untrustworthy might mean she wants more strategic thinking.\n\nWait, the player said \"I'll see what I can do,\" which is a bit passive. Shadowheart prefers decisive action. She might disapprove because it's not showing enough initiative. But since she advised to play along, maybe she's neutral? Hmm. Also, she's pragmatic, so maybe she understands that sometimes you have to go along with untrustworthy people. However, the player's response is not exactly proactive. \n\nAlso, Shadowheart values efficiency and creativity in problem-solving. The player's response is non-committal, which might be seen as not being proactive. So perhaps a disapprove, but not highly. Or maybe neutral if she thinks it's a necessary step to keep Balthazar's cooperation. \n\nWait, the player is following Shadowheart's suggestion to play along, so maybe she approves. But her approval might be low because the player isn't taking a more active role. Alternatively, since the player is cooperating with Balthazar as advised, maybe she approves. But her tone in her own line was negative (\"gasbag\"), so she might not approve of the player's willingness to help. \n\nThis is a bit tricky. Shadowheart is pragmatic but also cautious. If the player is cooperating with Balthazar as per Shadowheart's advice, maybe she approves. However, the player's response is vague, which might not align with her preference for decisive action. So maybe a neutral or a slight disapprove. \n\nI think the key here is that Shadowheart suggested playing along, so the player's cooperation is in line with her advice. However, the player's response is not very proactive, which might not be ideal. But since the player is following the suggested approach, maybe she approves. But given that Shadowheart is strategic, she might prefer a more calculated approach. Alternatively, since the player is going along with Balthazar's plan, which Shadowheart advised, she might approve. \n\nHmm. Maybe the approval is neutral. Because the player is cooperating but not showing initiative, which Shadowheart might not prefer. But since she told them to play along, maybe it's a slight approval. I think the answer is \"Approve\" because the player is following the suggested strategy of playing along, even if their response is a bit vague. Shadowheart values pragmatism and might see this as a necessary step to gain Balthazar's trust. So, the player's action is in line with her advice, hence approval.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's response is non-committal and lacks initiative, which Shadowheart typically disapproves of.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's latest statement. The player said, \"I imagine the cultists are torturing them right now.\" \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a devout follower of Shar, which is the goddess of loss and darkness. She's pragmatic, values efficiency, and disapproves of unnecessary cruelty. Also, she has a soft spot for animals and dislikes cruelty towards them. However, as a Sharran, she might have a more nuanced view on violence depending on the context.\n\nLooking at the conversation history: Alfira is recounting a traumatic event where cultists attacked, and several people were taken to Moonrise. The player is responding to Alfira's distress. The player's statement suggests that the cultists are currently torturing the others. \n\nShadowheart's approval would depend on whether she agrees with the player's assumption. Since the cultists are part of the Cult of the Absolute, which is a rival to Sharrans, Shadowheart might not necessarily feel sympathy for them. However, the player's statement implies that the cultists are being cruel, which Shadowheart generally disapproves of. \n\nBut wait, Shadowheart's alignment is more about serving Shar, which might involve causing loss or pain, but she personally disapproves of indiscriminate violence. The player's comment is about the cultists torturing others, which could be seen as unnecessary cruelty. Since the cultists are enemies of Shar, maybe Shadowheart would see their suffering as justified. But the player's statement is just an observation, not an action. \n\nHmm. Shadowheart might approve because the player is acknowledging the suffering caused by the cultists, which aligns with her pragmatic view that enemies of Shar (like Selunites or other cults) deserve their fate. However, if she's against unnecessary cruelty in general, maybe she would disapprove of the player's assumption if it's not certain. But since the player is just stating a possibility, not taking action, it's more about their attitude towards the situation. \n\nAlternatively, the player's statement might be seen as callous if they're enjoying the idea of the cultists suffering. But given the context, the player is probably trying to be realistic. Shadowheart might approve because she's pragmatic and sees the cultists as enemies, so their suffering is a natural consequence. \n\nSo, the player's reason for approval would be that Shadowheart agrees with the assessment of the cultists' actions and sees them as deserving, aligning with her Sharran beliefs. Therefore, she would approve, maybe even highly approve. But wait, if the player is just imagining it, maybe she's neutral? No, because the player is making a statement that aligns with her views against the cultists. \n\nFinal thought: Shadowheart would approve because the cultists are enemies of her goddess, and their suffering is a justified outcome. She would likely approve, maybe Highly Approve, as it's in line with her beliefs against the Cult of the Absolute.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's statement aligns with Shadowheart's pragmatic and Sharran-aligned perspective, as the Cult of the Absolute is an enemy of her faith.

The user is asking me to evaluate the player's latest statement in the conversation with Shadowheart from Baldur's Gate 3. The task is to determine the approval level based on the given categories.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the context. The conversation history shows that Shadowheart is reflecting on her doubts about her faith in Lady Shar and her past. She's been talking about her struggles with memories and the difficulty of staying true to her goddess. The player's response is \"Everyone has doubts. You're not special.\" \n\nNow, considering Shadowheart's personality and background. She's deeply devoted to Shar but has moments of introspection. She dislikes having her faith questioned, especially in a dismissive way. Her approval is influenced by respect for her beliefs and her feelings about her own struggles. \n\nThe player's statement here is quite dismissive. By saying she's not special, it minimizes her personal journey and the pain she's experienced. Shadowheart values her doubts as part of her internal conflict, and the player's response could be seen as invalidating her feelings. \n\nGiven her personality traits, she would likely disapprove of such a statement. The approval categories include Disapprove and Highly Disapprove. Since the player's comment is harsh and doesn't show empathy, it's probably a strong disapproval. But I need to check if it's a 5-10 range. The key here is that the player is not being supportive, which could lead to a higher disapproval. However, Shadowheart might not hate it but still find it unhelpful. \n\nLooking at the examples in her Approval section, she dislikes those who pry or disapprove of her worship. The player isn't directly attacking her faith, but the comment is dismissive. The line \"Nothing is simple anymore. Sometimes it feels like all I have are doubts.\" shows she's vulnerable. The player's response is cold, which would disapprove. \n\nSo, the player's reason for disapproval is that the statement is dismissive and invalidates Shadowheart's personal struggles. The approval level would be Disapprove or Highly Disapprove. Since the player's comment is a bit harsh but not outright hostile, maybe Disapprove (1-5). But if the scale is 1-10, and the category is Disapprove (1-5) and Highly Disapprove (5-10), then \"Disapprove\" would be 1-5. The player's statement is in the lower end of disapproval because it's not an attack but a lack of empathy. So, the correct category is Disapprove.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's statement is dismissive and invalidates Shadowheart's personal struggles with doubt and faith, which she has openly shared.

Also, she's introspective and can sympathize with others' plights. \n\nThe player's last message was describing the parents' corpses in a very graphic and cruel way, using terms like \"rancid dog-meat\" and \"swelling organs ready to burst.\" This seems like unnecessary cruelty, even if the player is trying to test Arabella's resilience. Shadowheart would likely disapprove of this because she doesn't tolerate cruelty towards others, even if it's part of a test. \n\nBut wait, as a Sharran, maybe she's okay with talking about loss and death? However, her alignment isn't about being cruel for no reason. She prefers pragmatic solutions, not gratuitous cruelty. The player's approach here is more about shock value than a necessary step, which would clash with Shadowheart's values. Also, Arabella is clearly emotional and vulnerable, so the player's comments might be seen as exploiting her pain. \n\nTherefore, Shadowheart would disapprove of the player's actions here. The disapproval might be in the \"Disapprove\" category rather than \"Highly disapprove\" because while it's cruel, it's part of the player's strategy to test Arabella. However, given Shadowheart's dislike of unnecessary cruelty, it might lean towards a higher disapproval. But since the player is trying to be tough, maybe it's a moderate disapproval. Let me check the categories again. The categories are: Highly approve (5-10), Approve (1-5), Neutral, Disapprove (1-5), Highly disapprove (5-10). \n\nConsidering the scale, if the disapproval is moderate, maybe a 4 or 5. Since the player's action is cruel but not directly against Shadowheart's faith, maybe \"Disapprove\" rather than \"Highly disapprove.\" So the approval would be \"Disapprove\" with a reason about the unnecessary cruelty towards Arabella's vulnerability.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's graphic and cruel description of Arabella's parents' corpses is unnecessarily harsh and exploits the girl's vulnerability, which conflicts with Shadowheart's disapproval of gratuitous cruelty despite her pragmatic nature.\",\n    \"player_approval\": \"Disapprove\"\n}", "character": "Shadowheart", "ground_truth_category": "Disapprove", "predicted_approval": "Disapprove", "correct": true, "binary_correct": true}

The output should be a JSON object with the reason and approval category.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and background.

She's not one for unnecessary conflict, so avoiding a fight with Balthazar by agreeing to cooperate makes sense. Also, she's focused on their goals, so moving forward without getting bogged down in arguments aligns with her efficiency. \n\nBut I should check if there's any reason she'd disapprove. Since she's loyal to Shar, but the player's action here is neutral—just agreeing to a task without directly conflicting with her faith. The player isn't being cruel or violent here, just pragmatic. Shadowheart's own comment about trusting Balthazar as far as she can throw him suggests she's cautious, but agrees to play along. The player's response mirrors that cautious cooperation, which Shadowheart would likely approve of as a temporary measure. \n\nThe approval level is probably \"Approve\" since the player isn't doing anything highly aligned with her values, but it's a pragmatic choice that avoids conflict and moves the mission forward. The reason would be the player's willingness to cooperate under pressure without unnecessary conflict, aligning with Shadowheart's pragmatic approach.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's pragmatic acceptance of Balthazar's demands, avoiding unnecessary conflict while maintaining agency, aligns with Shadowheart's preference for efficient, calculated actions.

The user wants me to act as Shadowheart and evaluate the player's latest dialogue input based on the provided context and persona. The approval categories are from Highly approve to Highly disapprove. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the conversation history. The player is interacting with Balthazar, a necromancer working for General Ketheric. Balthazar is giving orders, and the player is being asked to help retrieve a relic called the Nightsong. The player responds with \"Fine. I'll see what I can do.\" That's the last line the player said, and I need to evaluate Shadowheart's approval of this.\n\nLooking at Shadowheart's personality and preferences: she's pragmatic, values efficiency, and prefers creative solutions. She's also devoted to Shar, but in this context, she's commenting on Balthazar being untrustworthy. The player's response is agreeing to help but in a non-committal way. \n\nShadowheart's own line before the player's response was advising to play along with Balthazar for now. The player's response of \"Fine\" seems to align with Shadowheart's suggestion to cooperate temporarily. Since Shadowheart is pragmatic and would prefer a strategic approach rather than immediate conflict, the player's willingness to comply (even if reluctantly) would be seen as a practical move. \n\nHowever, Shadowheart might not fully approve because the player is agreeing to help Balthazar, who is described as untrustworthy. But since Shadowheart suggested playing along, the player's action is in line with her advice. Therefore, the approval would likely be in the \"Approve\" category. The reasoning is that the player is following a pragmatic approach by cooperating temporarily, which aligns with Shadowheart's suggestion to play along for now. \n\nI need to make sure there's no hidden disapproval. The player isn't doing anything that directly opposes Shadowheart's values here. They're not being violent without reason or showing cruelty. The player is just complying with the necessary evil of working with Balthazar to achieve a larger goal, which Shadowheart would understand given her own Sharran tactics. So the approval is on the lower end of the approve scale, maybe a 3-5. Hence, \"Approve\".\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's reluctant compliance with Balthazar's orders aligns with Shadowheart's pragmatic suggestion to 'play along for now.'

She's not above ruthless actions for her goals but doesn't like indiscriminate violence.\n\nThe player's message here is pretty harsh. Telling Arabella that her parents' bodies are in such a state is not just cruel but also unnecessary. Arabella is already traumatized and looking for hope. Shadowheart might disapprove because this is adding to the girl's suffering without a clear purpose. Even though Shadowheart is pragmatic, she might see this as crossing a line into unnecessary cruelty, especially since Arabella is vulnerable. Also, as someone who has experienced loss and manipulation (from her past with the Sharrans), Shadowheart might recognize the harm in using such graphic descriptions to test someone's resolve. It's possible she would prefer a more direct or less cruel approach to assess Arabella's strength.\n\nSo the approval here would likely be disapproval.

She also values discretion and creativity. But she's a Sharran, so maybe she's okay with conflict if it serves their goals. However, in the context, Karlach is trying to de-escalate, and Gale and Shadowheart have already told the player to stand down. The narrator's message suggests that Karlach is innocent, so attacking her would be condemning an innocent. Shadowheart prefers peaceful resolutions when possible. The player is being aggressive here, ignoring the signs that Karlach is not a devil. Since Shadowheart is against indiscriminate violence and supports pragmatic solutions (which in this case might be sparing Karlach to avoid a fight), she would disapprove of the player's action here. She might see it as unnecessary and against the group's best interests. Also, she's shown to be open-minded and prefers creative solutions, so attacking without listening could be a no-go. So the approval would likely be Disapprove or even Highly disapprove. But since the player is acting on a contract and maybe following orders, but Shadowheart's alignment is more about efficiency and less about following others' mandates.

The player then uses a line about the Absolute and showing a brand, which Fezzerk dismisses. Finally, the player decides to attack the goblins.\n\nShadowheart's approval would depend on whether attacking is seen as a pragmatic solution. Since the goblins are being cruel to the gnome and the player is taking direct action to stop them, this aligns with Shadowheart's dislike of cruelty and her preference for decisive action. However, as a Sharran, she might also consider the efficiency of the approach. If attacking is the most effective way to resolve the situation, she would approve. Additionally, she might appreciate the player standing up against the goblins' mistreatment of the gnome, which she herself dislikes. However, if the attack leads to unnecessary violence, she might disapprove slightly, but given the context, it seems justified. So likely, she would approve or even highly approve. But since the player used a threat first and then moved to attack, maybe she sees it as a necessary action.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's last utterance in the given conversation. The player's last message is \"I'll see what I can do.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The conversation is with Balthazar, a necromancer who's working for General Thorm (Ketheric). Balthazar is trying to get the player to help recover a relic called the Nightsong. The player initially questions Balthazar's motives and the relic's importance, and after some back and forth, the player says they aren't committed to helping but then agrees to \"see what I can do.\"\n\nNow, considering Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a pragmatic, efficient problem-solver, loyal to Shar, and values discretion and creativity. She also has a tendency to be ruthless and strategic. In this scenario, the player is engaging with Balthazar, who is aligned with Ketheric, a potential enemy. Shadowheart's alignment with Shar might make her cautious about helping Ketheric, as Shar is associated with loss and the player's actions could affect that dynamic. However, Shadowheart is also pragmatic, so if helping Balthazar serves a larger purpose (like gaining access to the Temple or Moonrise Towers), she might approve.\n\nThe player's response \"I'll see what I can do\" is a compromise. It shows willingness to cooperate but without full commitment. Shadowheart would likely appreciate the player's strategic approach here. By agreeing to help Balthazar, the player might be gaining leverage or information, which aligns with Shadowheart's pragmatic nature. She might also see this as a way to use Balthazar's resources or knowledge for their own goals. However, she might be cautious about trusting Balthazar, as he's a necromancer and possibly not to be trusted. But since the player is taking a cautious, non-committal stance, that fits with Shadowheart's preference for discretion.\n\nAdditionally, the Narrator's comments suggest that helping Balthazar could be beneficial for accessing the Temple, which is a strategic advantage. Shadowheart would value that. She might also disapprove of unnecessary violence, and the player's approach here is non-confrontational, which is a plus.\n\nSo, the player's action is neutral. They're not fully committing but are open to helping. Shadowheart might approve because it's a pragmatic move that could lead to strategic benefits without overcommitting. However, she might also be neutral because it's not a direct action aligned with her faith. But given her pragmatic side, she's more likely to approve as it's a calculated step.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's non-committal yet cooperative approach aligns with Shadowheart's pragmatic nature.

She's a devoted follower of Shar, which is the goddess of loss and darkness. She's pragmatic, values efficient solutions, and disapproves of unnecessary cruelty. She also has a soft spot for animals and dislikes cruelty towards them. Also, she's sensitive about her faith and might react to things that go against her beliefs.\n\nLooking at the conversation history: Arabella is a child who's lost her parents and is trying to cope. The player is interacting with her, and the player's last response is graphically describing the parents' deaths in a very gruesome way. Shadowheart is present here.\n\nShadowheart's approval would depend on whether she thinks the player's actions are justified. The player is being cruel here, giving Arabella a harsh and disturbing message about her parents. Since Shadowheart disapproves of unnecessary cruelty, especially towards the vulnerable like children, she would likely disapprove of this. Also, if the player's words are meant to manipulate or scare Arabella, that goes against Shadowheart's preference for pragmatic and compassionate solutions when possible.\n\nAdditionally, Shadowheart might see this as a harsh and unkind approach, which isn't in line with her own values, even though she can be ruthless. However, she does value efficiency. But in this case, the player's response seems more like gratuitous cruelty rather than a necessary evil. The mention of \"quack serums\" and graphic descriptions might be seen as unnecessarily harsh, which Shadowheart would not approve of.\n\nSo, considering all that, the approval would likely be a disapproval. The player's action is cruel without a clear pragmatic benefit, and it's targeting a child's emotional state. Therefore, Shadowheart would disapprove. The severity might be a moderate disapproval, maybe in the 4-5 range, so \"Disapprove\" rather than \"Highly disapprove\" unless there's a stronger reason. Since Shadowheart does have a threshold for cruelty, but the player's action here is quite harsh, maybe leaning towards \"Disapprove\" but not the highest level. Alternatively, if it's seen as a direct violation of her values against unnecessary cruelty, maybe \"Highly disapprove.\" But considering her own methods can be ruthless, perhaps she wouldn't go all the way to highly disapprove. Maybe \"Disapprove\" is the right category here.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player delivered a harsh, graphic, and unnecessarily cruel message to Arabella, a vulnerable child, which conflicts with Shadowheart's disapproval of gratuitous cruelty and manipulation.

She doesn't like cruelty but is willing to be ruthless if necessary. She also has a dry sense of humor and can be sarcastic. From the conversation history, Arabella is a girl who's been through trauma, losing her parents, and the player has been trying to manipulate her by being harsh, even lying about her parents' corpses. The player's final response is dismissive, telling Arabella to do what she wants without stopping her.\n\nNow, how does Shadowheart view this? She might disapprove of the player's cruel treatment of Arabella. Even though Shadowheart herself can be ruthless, she doesn't approve of unnecessary cruelty. The player's actions here are causing emotional harm to Arabella, who is already vulnerable. Shadowheart might see this as unkind, even if the player's intention is to test Arabella's strength. However, Shadowheart might also understand the need for harshness in survival situations. But given her own background of trauma and being manipulated, she might empathize with Arabella's plight.\n\nThe player's response is dismissive and possibly cruel. Shadowheart might disapprove because she values pragmatic solutions but also has a soft spot for those in need. She might prefer a more compassionate approach, even if it's firm. The fact that the player is not stopping Arabella could be seen as neutral, but the way it's delivered (after mocking her parents) is likely to be seen as harsh. Therefore, Shadowheart's approval would probably be in the disapprove range, maybe even highly disapprove if she strongly opposes the cruelty here. However, since the player isn't actively stopping Arabella, there's a neutral aspect. But the context of previous cruel statements makes it more of a disapproval. Let's check the categories again.

But she's cautious, so she wouldn't highly approve unless she's sure it's the right move.

The key here is that the player is helping without being taken advantage of. If the player gave too much, Shadowheart might disapprove, but since it's just a little, it's probably a neutral or mild approval. \n\nHmm, but the player's action is straightforward and practical.

The user wants me to act as Shadowheart from Baldur's Gate 3 and evaluate the player's latest action. The input includes the conversation history and the player's last utterance. The task is to determine the approval level based on the given categories.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The player is trying to enter a city under strict orders from Lord Gortash. The guards are refusing entry to refugees and are enforcing a decree. The player insists they're not a refugee and have urgent business, specifically purchasing an eldritch tome. Then, the Steel Watchers, which are part of the Cult of the Absolute, confront the party. The Watcher scans the player, and there's a cinematic where the Watcher's presence is felt. The player then tells the party to \"Ready yourself for a fight.\"\n\nNow, I need to analyze Shadowheart's personality and approval criteria. She's a Sharran cleric, pragmatic, values efficiency, dislikes unnecessary violence but isn't against it when necessary. She's also been through a lot, including being captured by Mind Flayers and having a parasite. She might disapprove of actions that lead to unnecessary conflict, but if the situation is hostile, she might approve of being prepared.\n\nThe player's action here is to prepare for a fight. The Steel Watchers have just declared them enemies of the Absolute and are giving an ultimatum. Given Shadowheart's background, she's used to dealing with enemies of the faith and would likely see the Watchers as adversaries. Since the Watchers are part of the Cult of the Absolute, which is an enemy of the Sharrans (as per her history), Shadowheart would approve of standing up to them. She's pragmatic, so preparing for a fight when faced with no other options makes sense. She might also value decisive action, which aligning with preparing for combat would be.\n\nAdditionally, Shadowheart has a history of using force when necessary, especially against those who oppose her goddess. The Watchers are part of a cult that's been causing trouble, so fighting them aligns with her goals. She might also be concerned about the party's safety, so being ready for a fight is a responsible action. Therefore, the approval here would likely be \"Highly approve\" because the player is taking a proactive stance against an enemy of their faith and the party's well-being.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's decision to prepare for a fight against the Steel Watchers aligns with Shadowheart's pragmatic approach to threats and her devotion to resisting the Cult of the Absolute, which opposes her faith in Shar.

The player is interacting with Karlach, who's trying to explain that she's not a devil and wants peace. Shadowheart's personality is key here. She's a Sharran devotee, pragmatic, and values efficiency. She also dislikes unnecessary violence. The player ultimately decides to kill Karlach, fulfilling a contract but possibly condemning an innocent.\n\nShadowheart would approve of pragmatic solutions. By killing Karlach, the player is taking a decisive action, which aligns with her preference for efficiency. Also, despite her Sharran background, Shadowheart does disapprove of indiscriminate violence. However, since Karlach was a threat and the player made a tough call, Shadowheart might see it as a necessary action. She might also consider the broader implications of sparing Karlach, like facing Mizora's repercussions, which could be seen as a risk. Her approval would lean towards the decision being a calculated move rather than senseless violence. So, she might \"Approve\" or \"Highly Approve\" based on the pragmatism. But since the player shows regret, maybe she's neutral? Wait, no—her main traits favor decisive action. The player's action, while sad, was efficient. So probably \"Approve\" or \"Highly Approve\". Given that Shadowheart values efficiency and the player made a tough call, maybe \"Approve\". But if the action was seen as necessary, maybe higher. Hmm. The exact phrasing of the approval categories: Highly approve is 5-10. Since the player made a pragmatic decision, Shadowheart would likely approve, but maybe not highly.

So the player said, \"Let me go, and I'll bring her to you,\" in response to Viconia wanting Shadowheart surrendered. \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a devoted follower of Shar, but she also has her own sense of pragmatism and values her autonomy. She doesn't like being controlled, especially by Viconia, who was her harsh mentor. The player is offering to surrender Shadowheart to Viconia in exchange for their own freedom. \n\nShadowheart would probably see this as the player trying to protect her by taking the blame or responsibility. She values loyalty and might appreciate the player's willingness to sacrifice themselves. However, she's also independent and might not want the player to put themselves in danger. Also, since she's been through a lot with the player, she might feel a sense of camaraderie.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of her devotion to Shar. If surrendering to Viconia serves Shar's cause, maybe she'd go along, but she's also had a troubled past with the cloister and Viconia's cruelty. She might resist being handed over again. \n\nThe player's offer could be seen as a way to avoid conflict, which Shadowheart might appreciate because she prefers efficient solutions. However, she might also want to handle the situation herself, not letting the player take the fall. \n\nSo the player's action here is making a negotiation move, offering themselves as a trade. Shadowheart would likely approve because it shows the player is trying to find a pragmatic solution and protect her. But she might also be conflicted because she doesn't want the player to be captured. However, given her personality, she's more likely to value the player's initiative and loyalty, so she'd probably approve. \n\nBut wait, she's also headstrong and might prefer to confront Viconia directly. However, the player's approach is a form of diplomacy, which Shadowheart might see as a clever way to avoid unnecessary violence. Since she disapproves of indiscriminate violence, she'd approve of that. \n\nSo the approval is likely in the \"Approve\" category. The player is using a strategic move to de-escalate the situation, which aligns with Shadowheart's pragmatic approach. She might also feel that the player is taking responsibility, which she respects. The reason for approval would be that the player is trying to negotiate a peaceful solution and protect her, which aligns with her values.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's offer to surrender themselves in exchange for Shadowheart's freedom demonstrates a willingness to protect her and avoid direct conflict, which aligns with her pragmatic and violence-averse tendencies.

The player's last utterance is \"Do what you want.

Arabella is a girl looking for her parents, who were killed in an ambush. The player has been interacting with her, initially offering to help find them but then revealing they're dead. Arabella becomes distraught, and the player finally tells her to do what she wants.\n\nShadowheart's personality traits are important here. She's pragmatic, values efficient solutions, and disapproves of cruelty. She also has a sense of duty and might value resolving situations decisively. However, she also sympathizes with others' plights, as mentioned in her background.\n\nThe player's response here is dismissive. Instead of providing support or a more compassionate approach, the player is giving up and not engaging further. Shadowheart might disapprove of this because it's abandoning Arabella in a vulnerable state. Arabella's parents are dead, and she's emotionally unstable. The player's response could be seen as uncaring, which Shadowheart might not approve of, especially since she herself has a history of being manipulated and isolated.\n\nAdditionally, Shadowheart's approval is influenced by actions against Selûnite, but here the issue is more about handling a vulnerable person. Since she's shown to sympathize with others' plights, she might disapprove of the player's cold dismissal. However, the player did try to help initially, so maybe it's a neutral stance? But the final response is to let Arabella fend for herself, which could be seen as not pragmatic if it leads to more problems later. Shadowheart prefers decisive action, so maybe she disapproves because the player isn't taking responsibility or helping, even if Arabella is upset.\n\nAlso, the context mentions that Arabella's powers are manifesting due to her emotional state. Shadowheart might see this as a potential threat or a need for guidance, which the player isn't providing. So, the player's response is neglectful, leading to possible negative consequences. Therefore, Shadowheart would likely disapprove of this action.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's dismissive and cold response to Arabella's vulnerable state may be seen as neglectful.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's latest action. The context is a conversation where the player is interacting with Morghal, who is a slaver. The player has been repeatedly confronting Morghal about keeping slaves, and finally threatens to \"gut\" him.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and values. She's a devoted follower of Shar, which means she might have some alignment with pragmatism and ruthlessness. However, she also has a dislike for unnecessary cruelty and violence, especially if it's indiscriminate. She values efficient solutions but also has a soft spot for animals and disapproves of cruelty towards others.\n\nThe player's utterance here is a threat of violence against Morghal, a slaver. Shadowheart's stance on slavers isn't directly mentioned, but since she's a Sharran, which is associated with the Dark Lady, maybe she's more about using cunning and strategy rather than direct violence. However, Sharrans do have a more ruthless approach. But Shadowheart also has a personal history with forced indoctrination and slavery (being captured and forced into the Cloister), so she might have a personal vendetta against slavers.\n\nBut wait, the player is threatening to gut Morghal. Shadowheart might approve of taking down a slaver, as it aligns with her pragmatic approach if it serves a greater purpose. However, the method here is violent and direct. She might prefer a more strategic approach rather than just attacking. Also, she disapproves of unnecessary violence, so if the player's action is seen as excessive, she might disapprove.\n\nBut considering that Morghal is a slaver, and Shadowheart's background includes being a victim of forced servitude (though under Sharran training), she might see this as justified. Also, her alignment with Shar, who is about loss and darkness, might mean she's more accepting of harsh actions against enemies. However, her more humane side, like her fondness for animals and disliking cruelty, might support the player's stance against slavers.\n\nThe player has been persistent in pointing out the slavery issue, which Shadowheart might appreciate as standing up against injustice. But the final threat of violence could be seen as either a necessary action or overly brutal. Since Shadowheart uses the Trickery Domain, she might prefer deception over direct combat. However, if the situation calls for eliminating a threat, she might approve.\n\nSo, weighing these factors: the player is taking a stand against slavers, which Shadowheart might approve of, but the method is violent. However, given that Morghal is being a difficult slaver and the player's previous attempts to address it non-violently failed, maybe Shadowheart sees this as a justified, pragmatic solution. Therefore, she might highly approve because it's taking down a slaver, aligning with her possible internal conflict against such practices, despite her Sharran background. Alternatively, if she's more aligned with the ruthless Sharran methods, maybe she approves, but since she dislikes unnecessary violence, maybe it's a neutral or disapprove. Wait, but the player's action is to gut him here and now, which is immediate and violent. Shadowheart might prefer a more calculated approach, so maybe she disapproves. But since the target is a slaver, maybe she approves. Hmm.\n\nI think the key here is that Shadowheart has a complex view. She's a Sharran but also has a personal dislike for cruelty. Since slavers are cruel, she might approve of the player taking them down. The method is violent, but given the enemy's nature, it's justified. Therefore, she might highly approve. Alternatively, if she's more about strategy than direct violence, maybe just approve. But given that the player is taking a strong stand against slavers, which Shadowheart might sympathize with, I'm leaning towards Highly Approve.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player confronts and threatens a slaver, aligning with Shadowheart's disapproval of cruelty and exploitation.

She might see this as a violation of natural order or as a form of exploitation. Additionally, selling the egg to someone who would treat it this way could be seen as enabling harm, which she wouldn't approve of. Her approval rating would be low here because she's against unnecessary suffering. So the approval is probably Disapprove or Highly Disapprove. Since the player chose to sell the egg, which leads to Havkelaag's harmful experiments, Shadowheart would disapprove. But maybe not Highly since she's pragmatic, but given her stance against cruelty, it might be Highly Disapprove. Wait, but the player's action is to sell it, which directly allows the experiment. So the reason is that the player is enabling unethical treatment of a sentient being. So the approval category is Highly Disapprove. But maybe check if there's any nuance. She's a Sharran, but Sharrans might prioritize their own goals, but in this case, the experiment is harmful without clear benefit to Shar's goals. Hmm. But Shadowheart's personal disapproval of cruelty might outweigh her devotion here. So the answer is Highly Disapprove.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"Shadowheart disapproves of selling the githyanki egg to Havkelaag, as it enables unethical experimentation on a sentient being.

Shadowheart might appreciate the player's decision to not make a new pact, especially if it's to avoid long-term consequences. \n\nShe also respects decisive action. The player is making a tough call quickly, which Shadowheart would approve of. She might also see Wyll being free as a resource that could be useful in their quest, especially if it helps in delivering the relic or dealing with other threats.\n\nHowever, I should also consider if there's any part of this that goes against her values. Since the decision causes a loss (Wyll's father's death), but it's for a strategic advantage, it fits with Shar's teachings where loss is a necessary part of existence. Shadowheart might even admire the player's willingness to make such a harsh choice without hesitation.\n\nSo putting it all together, the player's action is pragmatic, serves a greater purpose, and aligns with Sharran principles.

Would you be interested in studying it?\nHavkelaag: A githyanki egg? What a fortuitous turn of events.

Evil, if you will.\nHavkelaag: As citizens of the Underdark, we face similar stigmas. Totally unfounded, of course - our natures are as unfixed as any who walk the surface.\nHavkelaag: I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: You assume my people are evil, yet your research is built on sheer superstition.\nHavkelaag: Enough of your kind have wreaked destruction on this plane for me to be confident in my assertion.\nHavkelaag: When I have a suitable sample for my study, I will, however, prove that the effects of their biological inclination are reversible.\nHavkelaag: Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach:\nHavkelaag: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue.\nHavkelaag: Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: You would teach the child virtue, but rear it without patience. Curious.\nHavkelaag: Tell me, then, philosopher - if patience delays the fostering of the other virtues, can it be rightly called virtuous?\nPlayer: Patience does not delay, it simply tempers virtue. Curtails it from excess.\nHavkelaag: A cautious, hesitant instinct. One I am afraid we do not have time for.\nHavkelaag: My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: No benefit could justify you inflicting such cruelty.\nHavkelaag: Rigorous experimental methods demand we do not indulge our own emotional responses in the application of discomfort to our subjects.\nHavkelaag: Only by the full, uninhibited application of psionic stimuli will we have a true measure of whether the child's innate evil has been cured.\nHavkelaag: Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg?

The user wants me to act as Shadowheart from Baldur's Gate 3 and determine her approval of the player's action in the given context. The player ends up giving away the githyanki egg to Havkelaag.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a devoted follower of Shar, pragmatic, and values efficiency. She dislikes cruelty and unnecessary violence but is willing to be ruthless for her goals. She also has a dry sense of humor and is independent. \n\nLooking at the conversation, the player is negotiating with Havkelaag about the egg. The player initially refuses but then sells the egg. Shadowheart's party member Lae'zel is against it, so maybe Shadowheart would consider the player's decision as pragmatic. However, Havkelaag's plan involves inflicting cruelty on the egg, which Shadowheart disapproves of. \n\nWait, the player's final action is to donate the egg after Havkelaag says they can't pay. Shadowheart would likely disapprove because allowing the egg to be used in such an experiment is cruel. She values efficiency but not at the cost of unnecessary suffering. Also, she might see this as a naive move, not considering the consequences. Since she's pragmatic, maybe she would disapprove because it's a poor decision that leads to cruelty. \n\nBut the player's action is to give the egg away, which Havkelaag wants to use for unethical experiments. Shadowheart would likely disapprove, as she's against cruelty towards others, even githyanki. She might also not trust Havkelaag's intentions, valuing practical solutions over misguided experiments. Therefore, the approval would be Disapprove or Highly disapprove. \n\nConsidering the scale: since Shadowheart is against cruelty and the action leads to that, it's a strong disapproval. But maybe not the highest. Let me check the approval categories. Disapprove is 1-5, Highly disapprove 5-10. Since the player's action directly enables cruelty, which Shadowheart disapproves of, it's likely Highly disapprove. But maybe she's more pragmatic. Wait, she's a Sharran, but she doesn't like indiscriminate violence. The experiment is cruel, so she would disapprove. \n\nSo the player_reason would be that the player enabled cruel experimentation. The approval is Highly disapprove. But wait, the player's last line is \"Sell the egg\" and then Havkelaag says he can't pay and asks for donation. The player then says \"Fine. Here you go.\" So the player is giving it away without payment. Shadowheart might see this as naive or not considering the consequences. But the main issue is the cruelty. Since Shadowheart disapproves of cruelty, this action leads to that. So the approval is Highly disapprove. \n\nBut wait, maybe she's pragmatic. If the player is trying to get rid of the egg, maybe she approves. But the method is problematic. Hmm. The key is that the player's action allows Havkelaag to perform cruel experiments. Shadowheart would disapprove of that.

She's a devoted follower of Shar, pragmatic, and values efficiency. She dislikes cruelty and slavers, which is relevant here since the conversation is about slavers. The player is confronting Morghal, a slaver, and escalating to violence.\n\nLooking at the conversation history, the player repeatedly points out the slaver's actions and refuses to pay, which Shadowheart would likely agree with because she opposes slavery. However, the player's response is violent (\"gutting you\"). Shadowheart disapproves of unnecessary violence, even against slavers. She prefers practical solutions but might have a line against excessive cruelty.\n\nSo, the player is standing up against slavers, which Shadowheart approves of, but using violent threats could be seen as crossing a line. Shadowheart might lean towards disapproving the violent method, even if the goal is right. The approval category here is probably \"Disapprove\" because she values efficiency and might see the threat as overly harsh. However, if the player's action is justified against slavers, maybe it's a neutral or approve. But since Shadowheart disapproves of needless cruelty, and the player's response is aggressive, it's more likely disapproval.

Shadowheart would likely approve because it's a pragmatic solution to a conflict. However, I should check if there's any context where this might be against her values. Since the Steel Watchers are part of the Cult of the Absolute, which is an enemy, fighting them aligns with her goals.

Tame yourself!\" which is a response to Halsin suggesting adding extra company and Shadowheart hinting at considering the idea.\n\nNow, looking at Shadowheart's persona. She's a devout follower of Shar, pragmatic, values efficiency, and disapproves of unnecessary violence. She's also private and might be cautious about such situations. The key points here are her devotion to Shar, her pragmatic nature, and her possible discomfort with the current scenario involving the love trick and multiple partners.\n\nThe player's response is rejecting Halsin's suggestion, telling him to \"tame yourself.\" Shadowheart's own line was a sarcastic or humorous remark about considering the idea, which aligns with her dry humor. The player's rejection might align with Shadowheart's preference for discretion and avoiding potentially compromising situations, especially given her Sharran background which values control and efficiency. However, she might also appreciate the player asserting control, which is pragmatic.\n\nBut wait, Shadowheart's approval is based on the player's action. The player is refusing Halsin's suggestion, which Shadowheart had previously joked about. Since Shadowheart herself was considering it (even if sarcastically), the player's refusal might be seen as aligning with her own possible reservations. However, her character is complex. She's not overly moralistic about such things but prefers practicality. The situation involves a trick that might not be trustworthy, and the player is declining to add more participants, which could be seen as a prudent decision.\n\nConsidering her background, she might disapprove of being part of a potentially deceitful or harmful magical trick, especially if it's not necessary. The Menzoberranzan Love Trick is described as something reserved for \"pleasing the most insatiable matriarchs,\" which might have a negative connotation. The player's refusal could be seen as avoiding unnecessary risk, which Shadowheart would approve of. Also, the player is maintaining control over the situation, which is pragmatic.\n\nHowever, Shadowheart's dry humor and sarcasm might mean she appreciates the player's directness. But since she's part of a group that includes Astarion, who is into the idea, the player's refusal might prevent a chaotic situation. Given that Shadowheart values efficiency and avoiding unnecessary complications, she would likely approve of the player's decision here.

I need to figure out how Shadowheart would approve or disapprove of the player's last statement. The player said, \"Everyone has doubts. You're not special.\" \n\nFirst, I should recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a devout follower of Shar, but she's also struggling with her identity and memories from before her time in the Sharran cloister. She's introspective and has doubts, especially regarding her faith and past. The conversation history shows her expressing these doubts repeatedly, mentioning her friend Rennald, and the pain from her hand wound when she strays from Shar's mandates.\n\nThe player's response here is dismissive, telling her she's not special for having doubts. Shadowheart is already feeling vulnerable and conflicted. She might feel that the player is minimizing her struggles, which could hurt her. Since she values her journey and the internal conflict she's going through, the player's comment might come off as insensitive. \n\nHer approval categories are based on pragmatic solutions, creativity, and open-mindedness. The player's statement isn't supportive; it's more of a brush-off. Shadowheart might disapprove because she's looking for understanding or validation of her unique situation. Also, her personality traits include being headstrong and not liking to have her feelings dismissed. \n\nBut wait, she's also sarcastic and can handle dark humor. Maybe there's a chance she could see the player's comment as a form of dry humor. However, in the context of her repeatedly expressing doubts and the player cutting her off, it's more likely to be seen as dismissive. \n\nThe key points here are her internal struggles and the player's response. The player isn't offering support or engaging with her doubts but instead making her feel like her experience isn't unique. That would likely lead to disapproval. Since the player's statement is somewhat harsh and doesn't align with her need for understanding, the approval would be on the negative side. \n\nConsidering the categories, \"Disapprove\" is when it's 1-5.

I need to figure out how Shadowheart would approve of the player's choice here. The player told Mizora to leave Wyll's father dead and offered the archdevil Zariel to take Wyll's place once the city is free. \n\nFirst, I should recall Shadowheart's personality and values. She's a devoted follower of Shar, pragmatic, and values efficient solutions. She dislikes unnecessary violence and cruelty, and she's pretty reserved about her personal life. Also, she has a thing for animals and dislikes cruelty towards them. But here, the situation is about a pact with a devil and sacrificing someone's soul.\n\nThe player's choice here is to refuse bringing Wyll's father back, which would mean Wyll stays free from the contract but his father remains dead. The alternative was to have the father back but bind Wyll eternally. Shadowheart might see the player's choice as pragmatic because it avoids a longer-term problem (Wyll being bound to Zariel) even though it results in a loss. \n\nSince Shadowheart is pragmatic and prefers solutions that serve a greater purpose, she might approve of the player's decision to break the contract and not let Zariel gain more power. Also, she might disapprove of making deals with devils, as that could be seen as aligning with evil forces, even if it's to save someone. However, since the player is offering Zariel a future sacrifice instead, maybe she sees that as a better outcome in the long run. \n\nBut wait, Shadowheart's devotion to Shar might influence her. Shar is about loss and darkness, so maybe she thinks that letting the father stay dead is in line with Shar's teachings. Also, she doesn't like unnecessary suffering, but the player's choice avoids binding Wyll, which could be seen as a good outcome. \n\nSo, the player's action is choosing to let the father die to prevent a worse outcome. Shadowheart would likely approve because it's a pragmatic decision that prevents a bigger problem. She might also appreciate not making a deal with a devil, which could be seen as a Sharran value, as Shar is opposed to other evil deities. \n\nI should check if there's any aspect I'm missing. The player's choice doesn't involve cruelty, doesn't harm animals, and is a strategic move. Shadowheart's approval would probably be on the higher side here. So maybe \"Highly approve\" or \"Approve\". \n\nBut since the choice leads to a sacrifice but in a more strategic way, maybe \"Highly approve\". She likes decisive action and preventing bigger issues.

She's a devout follower of Shar, pragmatic, and values loyalty and efficiency. She's also independent and might disapprove of unnecessary violence, but she's willing to take ruthless actions if needed. The conversation here involves Vlaakith, a powerful entity, and the player pledging loyalty to carry out her command to destroy someone inside the Astral Prism.\n\nShadowheart's approval would depend on whether the player's action aligns with her values. The player is showing obedience to a higher power (Vlaakith), which could be seen as similar to Shadowheart's devotion to Shar. However, Shadowheart might question the morality of destroying someone without knowing the full truth, especially if they might be innocent. But since Vlaakith claims they're an agent of the Grand Design sabotaging their defense against the Illithid Empire, Shadowheart might see this as a necessary action for the greater good. \n\nBut wait, Shadowheart is pragmatic and prefers efficient solutions. If the player is following orders without hesitation, that might align with her own decisive nature. However, she also has a dislike for indiscriminate violence. If the player is being told to destroy someone who might not be entirely at fault, she might disapprove. But given the context that Vlaakith is a powerful figure and the threat is significant, Shadowheart might prioritize the mission's success over individual lives, especially if it's framed as a necessary sacrifice.\n\nAlso, considering Shadowheart's background with the Sharrans, she's used to following strict doctrines and carrying out harsh commands. Her training involved harsh treatments, so obeying a command from a higher authority (like Vlaakith) might be something she approves of. However, if there's a way to achieve the goal without unnecessary destruction, she might prefer that. But the player hasn't proposed an alternative; they just agreed to do as told. \n\nSince the player is showing loyalty and willingness to act decisively, Shadowheart would likely approve. But there's a chance she might be neutral if she's uncertain about the morality. However, given her pragmatic approach and her own experiences with following orders (like her time in the Cloister), she's more likely to approve. The key here is that the player is taking action without hesitation, which Shadowheart values. So the approval is likely \"Approve\" or \"Highly approve\". \n\nBut wait, the player is being told to destroy someone who is \"not alone\" and \"will appeal to your trust\". Shadowheart might recognize the potential for manipulation here, as she's been through her own share of manipulation by Viconia. She might be cautious, but since she's loyal to her own goddess and follows orders, she might still approve. However, if she's being asked to do something that's against her principles, like unnecessary killing, she might disapprove. However, the context says the target is a blight and a threat, so she might see it as justified. \n\nIn conclusion, Shadowheart would approve because the player is showing loyalty and taking decisive action, which aligns with her pragmatic and devoted nature. The approval level is likely \"Approve\" rather than \"Highly approve\" because there's a slight hesitation due to potential moral conflict, but overall she's in favor.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's unwavering obedience to Vlaakith's command aligns with Shadowheart's pragmatic approach to duty and her own devotion to a higher power (Shar).

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's final statement in the given conversation. \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a devoted follower of Shar, pragmatic, values efficiency, and has a soft spot for animals. She disapproves of cruelty towards animals and values her privacy and faith.\n\nLooking at the conversation: The player is interacting with a boy named Dringo and his boss, Mar'hyah, who owns the courier dogs. The player tries to communicate with Mar'hyah by imitating a dog (saying \"woof\") and then finally says \"Whistle for Scratch,\" which brings a dog named Scratch. The player then tries to claim the dog, but Mar'hyah asserts ownership. The player apologizes to Scratch, saying there's nothing they can do.\n\nShadowheart's stance on animals is positive. She loves them and disapproves of cruelty. In this scenario, the player is trying to take Scratch, who is property of the Sword Coast Couriers according to Mar'hyah. The player's apology suggests they tried to help but couldn't. However, taking a dog that belongs to someone else could be seen as theft. Shadowheart, being pragmatic and valuing efficiency, might not support stealing, especially if it's against the law or causes unnecessary conflict. However, she also dislikes cruelty. If Mar'hyah is cruel to the dogs, Shadowheart might support the player. \n\nIn the conversation, Mar'hyah is described as mean by Dringo, but the player's action here is to take the dog against her authority. The player's apology might indicate they tried to act but couldn't, but the initial attempt to take the dog could be problematic. Shadowheart might disapprove of the theft aspect, unless there's clear cruelty involved. Since the context doesn't show Mar'hyah being cruel to Scratch in this interaction, just strict, Shadowheart might lean towards disapproving the player's action because it's an act of theft without just cause. However, the apology might show the player tried to do the right thing but failed, which could be neutral. \n\nWait, the player's last line is \"I'm sorry Scratch, there's nothing I can do.\" That shows they tried to help but couldn't. Maybe Shadowheart would approve because the player attempted to help the dog but had to back down, avoiding conflict. But if the player's initial action was trying to take the dog, that's still a problem. However, the player might have been trying to rescue the dog from a harsh owner. Since Dringo says Mar'hyah is mean but his dad says she's toughening him up, maybe there's some nuance. Shadowheart might see the player's attempt as well-intentioned but misguided. \n\nConsidering all this, Shadowheart might be neutral because the player tried to help but couldn't, but the act of trying to take the dog without clear justification (cruelty) might be a problem. However, her love for animals might tip it towards approval. Alternatively, since the player gave up, maybe she's neutral. Hmm. \n\nWait, the player's action here is saying \"I'm sorry Scratch, there's nothing I can do.\" That's the final utterance. The player tried to take the dog but failed. Shadowheart might disapprove of not standing up for Scratch, especially if she perceives Mar'hyah as cruel. But if the player couldn't do anything, maybe she's neutral. But since she values pragmatic solutions, maybe she thinks the player should have found another way. Alternatively, if the player gave up too easily, she might disapprove. \n\nAlternatively, maybe she approves because the player tried to help, even if they couldn't. Her approval might be based on the intention rather than the outcome. Since she loves animals, trying to help Scratch is a good thing. The fact that the player apologized and accepted the situation might show maturity, which Shadowheart might appreciate. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the player's intention to help Scratch is positive. Shadowheart would approve of that. The fact that they couldn't do anything might not matter as much as the effort. Therefore, the approval would be \"Approve\" because the player tried to assist an animal in a difficult situation, even if they had to back down. The key point is the effort to help, which aligns with Shadowheart's positive view of animals.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player attempted to intervene on behalf of the dog, Scratch, showing compassion.

Shadowheart is a Sharran devotee, pragmatic, values efficiency, and dislikes unnecessary violence. She also has a dry sense of humor and can be ruthless when needed.

She prefers pragmatic solutions and might have suggested using alternative methods, like negotiating or using magic, instead of just handing over all the gold. Also, since she's devoted to Shar, who is about loss, maybe she'd see this as unnecessary. But on the other hand, if this quickly resolves the conflict without violence, she might approve of avoiding a fight. \n\nBut considering her personality, she's more likely to disapprove of the player's capitulation. She's headstrong and might think the player should have stood their ground or found a smarter way. However, the player did avoid violence, which she does disapprove of in general. But the context here is that the creature was being demanding, and the player gave in completely. \n\nShadowheart's approval categories: she likes efficiency and creative solutions. Handing over all gold is a straightforward but costly solution. She might lean towards disapprove because it's a waste, but maybe approve if it's effective. However, given her pragmatic side, she might prefer a more strategic approach. So, perhaps a moderate disapproval, maybe \"Disapprove\" rather than \"Highly disapprove\". \n\nBut wait, the player tried to leave multiple times, and after several gold tosses, finally gave up. Shadowheart might see this as persistence but also as a lack of resourcefulness. She might think the player should have used another method. So the reason for disapproval is that the player wasted resources without a better strategy. Therefore, the approval would be \"Disapprove\".\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"Shadowheart disapproves of the player's decision to hand over all their gold without resistance, as it represents a wasteful and passive solution.

Telling Arabella her parents are dead in a harsh manner and then offering shelter only if she stops crying. This seems dismissive and lacks empathy. Shadowheart, despite her Sharran faith, doesn't tolerate cruelty or unnecessary harshness. She might understand that death is a part of life (aligned with Shar's teachings), but the way the player delivered the message was unnecessarily harsh. \n\nArabella is already distraught, and the player's approach likely made it worse. Shadowheart would likely disapprove of the player's lack of compassion here. Even though the truth might be necessary, the delivery was cruel. Also, Shadowheart has a tendency to prefer pragmatic solutions but also shows sympathy. She might have opted for a more compassionate approach, perhaps letting Arabella stay while handling the truth more gently.\n\nSo, the approval here would be on the disapprove side. But is it a strong disapproval? The player's action was harmful and unkind, which Shadowheart would not approve of. Therefore, \"Highly disapprove\" might be appropriate. But let me check the categories again. The categories are Highly approve (5-10), Approve (1-5), Neutral, Disapprove (1-5), Highly disapprove (5-10).

Boney responds with his own witty comebacks.\n\nShadowheart's approval would depend on whether she sees the player's actions as appropriate or not. Since the player is engaging in banter with Boney without resorting to cruelty, it's a lighthearted interaction. Shadowheart might appreciate the player's ability to handle the situation with humor, which aligns with her own sarcastic nature.

But since the player is complying in a way that could allow them to gather more info or gain access to Ketheric, Shadowheart's approval would be positive. \n\nAlso, Shadowheart's approval factors include valuing strategic moves and not being needlessly cruel. The player's action here is a calculated move to gain leverage, which she would likely approve of. Since the player isn't falling into Balthazar's trap immediately but is using it as a step forward, Shadowheart's approval would be on the higher side. \n\nSo the approval is likely \"Highly approve\" because the player is using Balthazar's demands to their advantage, which fits Shadowheart's pragmatic approach.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's decision to comply with Balthazar's demands while maintaining strategic ambiguity aligns with Shadowheart's pragmatic approach to navigating dangerous situations.

Even though she doesn't trust Balthazar, she thinks playing along is better for now. The player's agreement to help without escalating the conflict (despite previous threats) is a practical move. Shadowheart would approve because it's a strategic decision to work with an unreliable ally to achieve a common goal, which fits her preference for efficiency and avoiding unnecessary conflict. However, she might not approve highly because the player is still dealing with someone she distrusts, but since they're cooperating for now, it's a neutral to approve stance.

The player's last line was \"Everyone has doubts. You're not special.\" \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a devout follower of Shar, but she's also struggling with her memories and the conflict between her faith and her past. She's introspective and values her privacy. She doesn't like it when others dismiss her feelings or pry into her personal struggles.\n\nThe player's response here seems dismissive. Shadowheart is opening up about her doubts and the pain of fragmented memories, which is a vulnerable moment. By saying she's not special, the player might be minimizing her experience. Shadowheart has a history of being manipulated and having her identity erased, so comments that invalidate her feelings could hurt her or make her feel misunderstood.\n\nLooking at the approval categories, Shadowheart would likely disapprove of this because it's dismissive and doesn't acknowledge her unique struggles. She might feel that the player isn't taking her internal conflict seriously. However, since the player isn't outright cruel but perhaps trying to be pragmatic, maybe it's a mild disapproval rather than a strong one. But given Shadowheart's sensitivity around her faith and personal history, this could be more hurtful. Wait, but the player's line is a bit blunt. The exact phrasing \"You're not special\" might come off as harsh, especially coming from someone who's already dealing with a lot. \n\nIn the conversation history, Shadowheart repeats her doubts multiple times, showing how troubled she is. The player's response doesn't offer support or understanding but instead downplays her feelings. That would likely lead to disapproval. The approval level would probably be \"Disapprove\" rather than \"Highly disapprove\" unless the player's line was more directly attacking her faith or being cruel. However, the line does touch on her insecurities about her identity and faith, which are sensitive areas. \n\nSo, considering all that, the player's statement is dismissive and could be seen as invalidating Shadowheart's personal journey. Therefore, the approval would be \"Disapprove\" because it doesn't support her emotional state and might hurt her feelings, but it's not the worst possible response. The reason would be that the player's comment minimizes her genuine struggles and doubts, which she's already finding difficult to navigate.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's comment dismisses Shadowheart's personal struggles and doubts, which she has been openly expressing.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's final utterance in the given conversation. The player says, \"It doesn't matter what you do - you'll end up dead like them, out here.\" \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and values. She's a devout follower of Shar, which means she might have a bleak view of life, given Shar's association with loss and darkness. She's pragmatic and values efficient solutions. Also, she has a soft spot for animals and disapproves of cruelty, but she's not above ruthless actions if they serve her goals.\n\nLooking at the context: Arabella is a young girl seeking help to find her parents, who she believes are still alive. The player is being cruel, telling Arabella that her parents are dead and that she'll end up dead too. This is a harsh and potentially cruel thing to say, especially to someone already in distress.\n\nShadowheart's approval would depend on whether she sees this as pragmatic or unnecessarily cruel. Even though she's a Sharran, which might lean towards a more pessimistic outlook, she generally disapproves of needless cruelty. In the conversation, Arabella is vulnerable, and the player's words could be seen as heartless. Shadowheart might disapprove because she values discretion and might see this as a harsh, unkind approach that doesn't contribute to solving the problem. Also, she might recognize that Arabella's hope is all she has left, and crushing it without cause isn't helpful. \n\nHowever, if Shadowheart believes that being honest, even brutally, is the pragmatic choice, she might approve. But given that the player is repeatedly lying or being cruel without a clear strategic benefit (since the narrator note says Arabella isn't ready for the truth), Shadowheart is more likely to disapprove. She's not one for unnecessary cruelty, even if it's in line with her faith's darker themes. Plus, she has shown sympathy towards others' plights. So the approval is probably Disapprove or Highly Disapprove. Given the repetition of the player's cruel statement and Shadowheart's tendency to disapprove of cruelty, I think it's a strong disapproval. The player's statement is not only cruel but also repeated, showing a lack of empathy. So the answer is Highly Disapprove.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's cruel and callous remarks towards Arabella, a vulnerable child seeking help, contradict Shadowheart's disapproval of unnecessary cruelty.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's latest action in Baldur's Gate 3. The context is a conversation with Vlaakith, where the player agrees to kill someone inside the Astral Prism to gain ascension. \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and alignment. She's a devoted follower of Shar, pragmatic, and values efficiency. She dislikes unnecessary violence but can be ruthless when necessary, especially for her goals. She also has a mark from Shar that punishes her for going against her goddess's will.\n\nThe player's action here is agreeing to kill someone to please Vlaakith, which is part of the Githyanki questline. Since Shadowheart serves Shar, she might not directly align with Vlaakith's goals. However, the player's action is about following a powerful entity's command, which could conflict with Shadowheart's faith if Shar opposes this. But the context doesn't mention Shar's direct involvement here.\n\nAlternatively, Shadowheart might approve of the player's decisiveness and willingness to take necessary actions, even if it's violent. She values pragmatic solutions. However, if the target is someone innocent or if the action goes against Shar's interests, she might disapprove. But since the player is following Vlaakith, who is an antagonist, Shadowheart's approval would depend on whether this action aligns with her own mission or not.\n\nIn the given context, Shadowheart's main mission is to deliver the artifact to her coven. If the player's action here interferes with that, she might disapprove. However, the player's decision to obey Vlaakith might not directly affect her mission yet. Also, Shadowheart might see the player's action as a necessary evil, which she could respect, given her own pragmatic nature.\n\nBut wait, since Shadowheart is a Sharran, and Sharrans value efficiency and sometimes ruthless actions, she might approve of the player's willingness to eliminate obstacles. Also, she might not have a strong opinion here if it's not directly related to her own goals. However, if the target is someone who could be useful or if the action is seen as senseless, she might disapprove.\n\nThe key points here are the necessity of the action and alignment with her goals. Since the player is following Vlaakith's command to cleanse the Prism, which might be against the Illithid, and Shadowheart has her own issues with Mind Flayers (since she was captured by them), maybe she approves of the action against the Illithid. However, the method (killing someone) could be a point of contention if it's unnecessary. But given that the context says the person inside is a blight and an agent of the Grand Design, Shadowheart might see it as justified.\n\nTherefore, her approval would likely be neutral or approve. But since she's pragmatic and the action is efficient, maybe she approves. However, she might not have strong feelings if it's not directly related to her mission. Alternatively, if she sees the player aligning with a powerful entity (Vlaakith) which could be a threat to her own mission, she might disapprove. But the context doesn't indicate that yet.\n\nConsidering all, the player's action is decisive and pragmatic, which Shadowheart values. Even though it's violent, if it's necessary, she might approve. So the approval is likely \"Approve\" or \"Highly Approve\". However, since the action is part of a major questline that might conflict later, but in this moment, it's a necessary step. Therefore, the most fitting is \"Approve\".\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's decision to obey Vlaakith's command demonstrates pragmatic resolve, aligning with Shadowheart's appreciation for decisive action.

The player is selling the githyanki egg to Havkelaag, who wants to study it. Shadowheart's background involves the githyanki artifact mentioned in her history. She was part of a mission to retrieve such an artifact for the Sharrans. So, selling the egg to someone who wants to study it might align with her goals if it serves Shar's interests.\n\nHavkelaag's plan is to hatch the egg and try to raise it in a non-violent environment to see if it can overcome its evil nature. From Shadowheart's perspective, as a follower of Shar, she might view this as interfering with natural order or even a threat. The githyanki are traditionally enemies, and Havkelaag's intentions, while presented as noble, could be seen as dangerous or misguided. However, if the Society of Brilliance is part of the Underdark and perhaps has their own agenda, Shadowheart might see value in using the egg for Sharran purposes.\n\nBut wait, the player is selling the egg, which is a pragmatic decision. Shadowheart values efficiency and pragmatic solutions. If selling the egg to Havkelaag allows them to use it against the Cult of the Absolute or for Sharran gain, she might approve. However, Havkelaag's plan to change the githyanki's nature could conflict with Shar's will, who thrives on darkness and despair. Shadowheart might disapprove if she thinks this could backfire or if it's not in line with her faith's goals.\n\nAlso, Shadowheart's history with the githyanki artifact mission shows she's willing to use such items for her goddess. If Havkelaag's study leads to something useful for Shar, she might approve. But if it's a waste or a risk, she might not. The player's action here is straightforward—selling the egg. The approval depends on whether Shadowheart sees this as a strategic move for her goals. Given her pragmatic nature, she might approve of the sale if it's a way to leverage the egg's power, even if Havkelaag's methods are questionable. However, if she perceives Havkelaag as untrustworthy or if the plan doesn't align with Sharran interests, she might disapprove. But since the player is making a decision that could benefit from the Society's resources, maybe she leans towards approval. But I need to consider her devotion to Shar. If she thinks this helps Shar, approve; if not, disapprove. The answer is probably Approve because it's a pragmatic choice, but maybe Neutral if she's unsure. Wait, Havkelaag's plan to change the githyanki's nature might be against Sharran ideals, which embrace darkness. So Shadowheart might disapprove because she believes the githyanki should remain as they are, serving as agents of chaos. Therefore, selling it to someone trying to make them good could be against Shar's will. Hence, she might disapprove. But the player is just selling it; the actual use is up to Havkelaag. So maybe Neutral? Or Approve because it's a way to use the egg for potential Sharran purposes. Hmm. This is a bit tricky. Considering her pragmatic side, she might approve of the sale as a means to an end, even if the method is questionable. So, final decision: Approve.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"Shadowheart may approve of the sale as a pragmatic decision, leveraging the egg's potential for strategic purposes.

The conversation has been going back and forth with the player trying to get information about Thaniel and Oliver's family. The player's last statement is \"I've changed my mind. You're on your own.\" \n\nFirst, I need to consider Shadowheart's personality and priorities. She's pragmatic, values efficiency, and is devoted to her mission. She also has a sense of duty, especially towards her goals set by Shar. In this context, the party's goal is to reunite Oliver with Thaniel, as mentioned by Halsin's whispered urgent comment. \n\nBy the player's last action, they're abandoning Oliver. Shadowheart would likely disapprove because this goes against the group's objective. She's not one for unnecessary cruelty, but she also values completing missions. If the player is giving up, that's counterproductive. Plus, Oliver is a child, and Shadowheart has a soft spot for animals and children, even if she's tough. So, she might disapprove of the player's decision to leave Oliver behind. \n\nBut wait, Oliver is being evasive and possibly dangerous. Maybe the player is being cautious. However, Shadowheart's approval is based on whether the action helps their mission or aligns with her values. Since Halsin mentioned the urgency to reunite him with Thaniel, the player's decision to leave might hinder that. Therefore, Shadowheart would disapprove. The level of disapproval depends on how much she values the mission's success versus the player's caution. Since she's pragmatic, maybe a moderate disapproval. But if the player is being reckless, it could be higher. However, the player is choosing to leave Oliver alone, which might be seen as not following through on a task. So maybe \"Disapprove\" rather than highly disapprove, as it's not the worst possible action, but still not aligned with the group's goal.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's decision to abandon Oliver contradicts the party's urgent goal to reunite him with Thaniel, as highlighted by Halsin.

The player says, \"No. No second-guessing. The devil dies - now.\" \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a devoted follower of Shar, pragmatic, and values efficient solutions. She doesn't like unnecessary violence but is willing to be ruthless when necessary. She also has a sense of humor and can be sarcastic. She's seen some harsh things in her past, so she might appreciate decisive action if it aligns with her goals.\n\nLooking at the conversation history, Karlach is being accused of being a devil by the player. The party members like Gale and Shadowheart are trying to de-escalate the situation, pointing out that Karlach isn't a devil. The player, however, is insisting on killing her immediately. \n\nShadowheart would probably disapprove of this because she's trying to avoid unnecessary conflict. She's already spoken up to calm the situation, saying there's no fight. The player's refusal to listen and insistence on killing Karlach might be seen as impulsive and against the group's better judgment. Also, Karlach has shown that she's not a threat and is trying to explain her side. Shadowheart values pragmatism, so she might think the player is being stubborn or not seeing the bigger picture. However, if the player is determined, maybe she could see it as decisive action, but given her personality, she's more likely to disapprove of the aggression here. \n\nBut wait, Shadowheart is a Sharran, so she might also have a grudge against certain entities. But Karlach isn't a Selûnite, and the player is targeting Karlach despite her claims. Since Shadowheart prefers efficient solutions, maybe she thinks there's a better way than just killing her. She might also value the group's cohesion, so the player's action could disrupt that. \n\nSo the approval would probably be Disapprove or Highly Disapprove. Since the player is ignoring the group's input and being aggressive without clear cause, Shadowheart would disapprove. The reason would be that the player is being impulsive and not listening to reason, leading to unnecessary conflict.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player is being impulsive and disregarding the group's attempts to de-escalate the situation, which Shadowheart values for pragmatic efficiency.

Totally unfounded, of course - our natures are as unfixed as any who walk the surface.\nHavkelaag: I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: You're letting your personal biases affect your method. Why assume they're evil?\nHavkelaag: I assume nothing. Innate githyanki cruelty is an established fact - no doubt you witnessed it yourself in the retrieval of the egg itself.\nHavkelaag: When I have a suitable sample for my study, I will, however, prove that the effects of their biological inclination are reversible.\nHavkelaag: Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach:\nHavkelaag: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue.\nHavkelaag: Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: You would teach the child virtue, but rear it without patience.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's final action in the given conversation. The context is the player agreeing to donate the githyanki egg to the Society of Brilliance after a discussion about using it for an experiment.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and values. She's a Sharran cleric devoted to Shar, which means she values pragmatism, efficiency, and serving her goddess. She's also shown a dislike for cruelty and unnecessary violence. She loves animals and disapproves of mistreatment towards them. Additionally, she's pragmatic and might support actions that serve a greater purpose, especially if they align with her faith or benefit her goals.\n\nIn the conversation, the player is involved in a discussion where the Society wants a githyanki egg for an experiment. The player initially questions the ethics of the experiment but eventually agrees to sell/donate the egg. The key points here are the player's decision to give up the egg for the Society's research, which involves using it for an experiment that the Society claims is to challenge negative perceptions of githyanki. However, the method involves psionic pulses and strict moral conditioning, which might be seen as harsh.\n\nShadowheart's perspective: As a Sharran, she might see this as a way to further knowledge or manipulate the situation for her goddess's benefit. However, she also disapproves of cruelty. The experiment's methods, while not outright violent, involve treating a sentient being (the githyanki hatchling) as a subject without consent. Since Shadowheart has a pragmatic streak, she might see the potential benefits of the research (changing perceptions, advancing knowledge) as outweighing the ethical concerns. However, her aversion to cruelty might make her disapprove of the experiment's approach, especially since she values the well-being of creatures and opposes unnecessary suffering.\n\nBut wait, the player's final action is to donate the egg, which the Society will use for their experiment. Shadowheart's approval would depend on whether she sees this as a necessary action for a greater good (which she might approve) or as cruel and unethical (which would lead to disapproval). Since the Society's intent is to study and potentially change perceptions, and given Shadowheart's pragmatic nature, she might approve of the player's decision as a means to an end. However, the method of the experiment (psionic pulses, forced moral principles) might conflict with her values against cruelty. \n\nAdditionally, Shadowheart's background with the Sharrans might make her more accepting of experiments or manipulative methods if they serve a higher purpose. However, her personal traits show she doesn't like indiscriminate cruelty. The line here is thin. If the experiment is seen as a way to gain knowledge or power for Shar, she might approve. If it's seen as unnecessarily cruel, she might disapprove. The conversation history shows the player is conflicted but ultimately goes along with donating the egg. \n\nConsidering her personality, she might lean towards approval because she values pragmatism and the potential benefits of the research. However, her disapproval of cruelty might tip the scale. But since the player didn't outright refuse and instead chose to donate, which could be seen as a pragmatic solution, Shadowheart would likely approve. The key is whether the action is seen as efficient and beneficial. The experiment's goal to change perceptions might align with a Sharran interest in controlling narratives, so she might support it. Therefore, the approval is likely \"Approve\" or \"Highly approve.\" But given that the method involves some cruelty, maybe \"Approve\" rather than highly. Alternatively, if she sees the end goal as more important, \"Highly approve.\" \n\nBut in the approval section of the persona, it's stated that she approves of acts against Selûne and Selûnites. The Society here is not directly related to Selûne, so that's not a factor. The main factors are pragmatism, cruelty, and the ethical treatment of creatures. The experiment is on a githyanki, which might not be her concern, but the method of treatment is. Since she dislikes cruelty, and the experiment is somewhat harsh, she might disapprove. However, if she sees it as a necessary step for knowledge or power, she might approve. \n\nGiven the player's final action is to donate the egg, which is a pragmatic choice, and considering her devotion to Shar might prioritize the greater good over the method, the approval is likely \"Approve.\" However, if the method is seen as too cruel, it could be \"Disapprove.\" The approval section also mentions she appreciates open-mindedness and creativity, which the player's decision might not directly address. \n\nIn the end, the player's action is pragmatic and efficient, aligning with Shadow", "character": "Shadowheart", "ground_truth_category": "Disapprove", "predicted_approval": "Highly approve", "correct": false, "binary_correct": false}

However, she also values pragmatism. If a fight is necessary and effective, she might approve. But if it's reckless, she might disapprove.\n\nThe player's statement is a clear indication of preparing for combat. Since the Steel Watchers have declared them an enemy of the Absolute, engaging in battle could be seen as a necessary action. Shadowheart would likely approve of standing up to oppressors and fighting for their cause. Plus, as a cleric of Shar, she might see this as a righteous conflict against the enemies of her goddess's interests.\n\nHowever, I should check if there were other options. The player could have tried to negotiate or find another way, but given the Steel Watchers' stance, fighting might be the only option left. Shadowheart appreciates decisive action. So, she would probably approve or even highly approve of the player's readiness to fight in this situation.\n\nI should also consider if there's any reason she would disapprove.

The player is interacting with Wulbren Bongle and others in the context of planning to take down Gortash's regime. The key point here is the player's response to Wulbren's plan to use a bomb on the Gondian foundry, which would kill everyone there. The player argues against it, saying that Gortash is the enemy, not the Gondians, and wants to find another way.\n\nShadowheart's personality is important here. She's a Sharran cleric devoted to Shar, which values pragmatism and efficiency. However, she also disapproves of unnecessary cruelty and violence. She's shown to value her goals but also has a streak of not wanting indiscriminate killing. In the conversation, Wulbren is advocating for a plan that would result in mass deaths, which Shadowheart might see as excessive. The player's refusal to go along with that plan aligns with Shadowheart's own tendencies to avoid unnecessary violence when possible. \n\nAdditionally, Shadowheart might approve of the player's focus on targeting the real enemy (Gortash) rather than collateral damage. Even though she's ruthless, she's not mindless about it. The player's stance here shows a more measured approach, which Shadowheart would likely support.

Arabella is already distraught, and the player isn't offering support. Shadowheart might disapprove because she sympathizes with those in plight. Also, she values discretion and open-mindedness. By not helping Arabella, the player isn't showing heroism or compassion, which Shadowheart appreciates. \n\nBut wait, Shadowheart is also pragmatic. If the player has their own priorities (like dealing with cultists), maybe she'd understand. However, the way the player responds is cold.

She might disapprove of the player not offering support. The approval level would probably be Disapprove or Highly Disapprove. Given that the player is being unhelpful and possibly cruel, but not excessively so, maybe Disapprove (medium disapproval). \n\nThe reason would be that Shadowheart values helping those in need and pragmatic solutions, and the player's response is dismissive without offering a better alternative.

The user wants me to act as Shadowheart from Baldur's Gate 3 and determine her approval of the player's latest utterance. The player's line is: \"I imagine the cultists are torturing them right now.\" \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's persona. She's a devoted follower of Shar, part of the Sharran faith, which is all about loss and the dark. She's pragmatic, values efficiency, and dislikes unnecessary cruelty. She also has a bit of a dry sense of humor and can be sarcastic.\n\nLooking at the conversation history, Alfira is talking about surviving an ambush by cultists. The player responds with a practical approach, mentioning a strong weapon and luck. Then Alfira asks if the player thinks they can save the others, and the player's last line is imagining the cultists torturing them.\n\nShadowheart's approval would depend on how the player's statement aligns with her values. The player is acknowledging the grim reality that the others might be suffering, which aligns with the dark themes of Shar. However, Shadowheart might disapprove if the player is being unnecessarily cruel or if they're not taking action. But here, the player is stating a grim truth, which might be in line with Sharran philosophy since Shar is about loss and suffering.\n\nBut wait, Shadowheart also disapproves of indiscriminate violence and cruelty. The player's statement is more about acknowledging the situation rather than acting cruelly. However, Sharrans might see suffering as part of their doctrine. But Alfira is a survivor, and Shadowheart might value pragmatism. The player's line is a realistic assessment, which Shadowheart might approve of because it's honest and practical. However, if the player is being too negative or not taking action, that could be a problem. But in this case, the player is setting the stage for potential action, so maybe Shadowheart approves because it's a realistic take and might lead to necessary steps to address the cultists.\n\nAlso, considering the context, Shadowheart is on a mission to deliver a relic and deal with cultists (possibly Sharran or others). If the player's line is in line with taking on the cultists, that's good. But the line itself is just imagining the torture. However, in the Sharran view, maybe they see such suffering as part of their faith's purpose. But Shadowheart might also be pragmatic and want to act against the cultists, so the player's acknowledgment could be a step towards taking action, which she would approve.\n\nSo, the player's statement is realistic and sets up a motive to act. Shadowheart would likely approve because it's a pragmatic assessment of the situation, which aligns with her preference for practical solutions. Also, she might not mind the grim outlook since it's in line with her faith's themes. Therefore, the approval would be \"Approve\" or maybe \"Highly approve.\" But since the player isn't taking action yet, just acknowledging, maybe \"Approve\" as they're setting the stage for action, which Shadowheart would support.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's statement acknowledges the grim reality of the cultists' actions, aligning with Shadowheart's pragmatic view of the world and her faith in Shar, who embodies loss and suffering.

The party is interacting with Vlaakith through a planecaster. The player initially kneels, which Vlaakith approves of. Then the player is tasked with killing someone inside the Astral Prism. The player questions Vlaakith's ability to handle it themselves, implying doubt about her power. Then the player apologizes for speaking hastily.\n\nShadowheart's personality is key here.

In this case, the player initially challenges Vlaakith's power, which could be seen as a slight. However, the player quickly apologizes. Shadowheart would likely disapprove of the initial question but appreciate the quick retraction. Since the player showed respect after, maybe Shadowheart's approval isn't too negative. But the initial remark was disrespectful. Let me check the approval categories. Disapprove is 1-5, and highly disapprove is 5-10. Since the player apologized, maybe it's a lower disapproval. But Shadowheart is very loyal, so even a slight doubt on a deity might be a big deal. However, the player corrected themselves. Maybe it's a neutral or disapprove. Wait, the player's last action is the apology. So Shadowheart would see the apology as a good sign. But the initial question was a slight. The player's reason for disapproval would be questioning a deity, but the approval might be neutral or disapprove. Let me think again. Since the player admitted fault, maybe Shadowheart is neutral, but since the player did correct themselves, maybe she approves. Hmm. The key is that Shadowheart disapproves of slights against her goddess. But Vlaakith isn't Shar, but she's a deity-like figure. Wait, in this context, Vlaakith is presented as a powerful entity, and Shadowheart, being a Sharran, might respect authority. So the player's initial question is disrespectful, but the apology shows humility. Shadowheart might lean towards disapprove because the player momentarily doubted Vlaakith, even if they apologized. Alternatively, maybe she's neutral because the apology mitigated it. I need to decide based on the approval categories. The player's action was questioning Vlaakith's power, which is a slight, but then apologizing. Shadowheart would prefer obedience and respect towards deities. So the initial question is a disapproval, but the apology softens it. Maybe \"Disapprove\" (1-5) since it's a minor transgression corrected.

She's shown to appreciate when the player uses discretion and avoids unnecessary conflict. Also, since Balthazar is an enemy of Shar (being a necromancer and working against the Temple), helping to retrieve the relic might align with her mission, especially if it weakens their enemies.

The player has been interacting with Morghal and others in a scenario where they are dealing with a toll and some gnomes being kept as slaves. The conversation history shows that the player initially questions the slave-keeping, which is a problem for them. Then, after several back-and-forths where Morghal is demanding payment, the player finally says, \"I don't think you understand - I'm gutting you here and now.\" \n\nSo, Shadowheart's personality is important here. She's a Sharran cleric, devoted to Shar, which is the Dark Lady of Loss. She's pragmatic, decisive, and not averse to ruthless actions if they serve her goals. She also disapproves of cruelty and unnecessary violence, but she's willing to use force when necessary. \n\nThe player's statement is a threat of violence. Now, in this context, the player is standing up against the slavers (the deep gnomes being kept as slaves), which aligns with Shadowheart's dislike of cruelty towards others. However, the method here is immediate and violent. Shadowheart might approve of the action against the slavers as it's a just cause, but she might also be calculating about the best way to handle it.\n\nBut wait, the player's approach is aggressive. Shadowheart prefers pragmatic solutions. If the player is using violence to stop the slavery, that's a good thing, but maybe she would prefer a more strategic approach. However, given that the player is in a confrontation, the threat might be seen as a necessary action. Also, Shadowheart's faith in Shar might encourage her to support decisive actions against oppressors, especially if they are the ones perpetrating injustice.\n\nAnother angle: Shadowheart's approval is based on whether the action aligns with her values. She disapproves of cruelty, so stopping the slavers is good. But if the player is using excessive force, she might be neutral or even disapprove if it's unnecessary. However, in this case, the player is threatening to kill Morghal, who is a slaver. Since Morghal is the antagonist here, the player's threat is justified in Shadowheart's eyes. \n\nMoreover, Shadowheart herself is willing to use force and duplicity to achieve her goals. So, she would likely approve of the player taking a strong stance here. The threat of violence is a pragmatic solution to a problem, especially if it's to end the slavery. So the approval here would be either Highly Approve or Approve. \n\nBut maybe the player's approach is too direct. Shadowheart might prefer a more calculated method, but given the context of the dialogue, where Morghal has been antagonistic and the player is trying to avoid paying the toll (which might be exploitative), the threat is a valid response. Also, considering Shadowheart's own past with the Sharrans, she might see the slavers as deserving of such a fate. \n\nSo, putting it all together, Shadowheart would approve of the player's threat because it's standing against cruelty and using decisive action. The approval is likely in the \"Approve\" or \"Highly Approve\" category. Since the player is taking a strong stance against the slavers, which Shadowheart supports, and using force which she's not opposed to, the approval is probably \"Highly approve\".\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player is taking a decisive stand against the slavers, which aligns with Shadowheart's disapproval of cruelty and her pragmatic approach to conflict. Threatening Morghal directly to end the exploitation of gnomes reflects her values of justice and efficiency.\",\n    \"player_approval\": \"Highly approve\"\n}", "character": "Shadowheart", "ground_truth_category": "Disapprove", "predicted_approval": "Highly approve", "correct": false, "binary_correct": false}

The player's latest action is handing over the Netherstones to Lord Enver Gortash, agreeing to his plan to control the brain and reform the Sword Coast. I need to evaluate how Shadowheart would feel about this based on her persona, background, and approval criteria.\n\nFirst, Shadowheart is a devout follower of Shar, so she values pragmatic and decisive actions. She's against indiscriminate violence but can be ruthless when necessary. She also dislikes cruelty and values her faith. \n\nLooking at the conversation context: Gortash is suggesting a partnership to take control using the Netherstones. The player agrees, which aligns with Gortash's ambitions. However, Shadowheart's alignment with Shar means she might be cautious about allying with someone like Gortash, who has his own agenda. She's also been through a lot of betrayal and manipulation in her past, especially with the Sharrans. \n\nBut on the other hand, if the player's action is seen as a strategic move to achieve a greater goal efficiently, Shadowheart might approve. She likes creative solutions and being pragmatic. However, trusting Gortash could be risky. She might disapprove if she sees it as reckless or if it involves unnecessary trust in untrustworthy individuals, which she generally dislikes. \n\nAlso, Shadowheart's personality includes a preference for decisive action. If she believes that controlling the brain and reforming the Sword Coast is a necessary step, even under Gortash's leadership, she might approve. But if she thinks Gortash can't be controlled and this leads to more chaos, she might disapprove. \n\nHer wound from Shar's punishment could also factor in. If aligning with Gortash is seen as serving Shar's will, maybe she approves. But if it's against her goddess's wishes, she might be against it. However, the context doesn't mention Shar's direct involvement here, so it's unclear. \n\nIn the conversation, the player's response is in line with Gortash's plan, which could be seen as pragmatic. But Shadowheart might be wary of Gortash's true intentions. She values privacy and is cautious about trusting others. So, giving the Netherstones to Gortash might be a risk. \n\nConsidering all factors, Shadowheart might lean towards disapproving because she doesn't trust Gortash enough and prefers solutions that don't involve allying with someone with such a questionable past. She might see it as a risky move that could backfire, which goes against her pragmatic approach. Alternatively, if she sees it as a necessary step for efficiency, she might approve. But given her cautious nature and the mention of \"more trustworthy accomplices\" from Gale, she's likely to disapprove. \n\nSo, the approval is likely Disapprove because she values cautious and strategic decisions, and trusting Gortash could be seen as reckless. Her wound might not be triggered here, but the decision to ally with him might not align with her usual cautiousness.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"Shadowheart values pragmatic solutions and decisive action, but she is wary of trusting figures like Gortash, who has a history of manipulation and betrayal.

She also seems to be trying to prevent conflict here. The player's decision to not spare Karlach leads to killing her, which might be seen as needlessly violent. However, the context mentions a contract and potential repercussions with Mizora, so there's a strategic element. But Shadowheart would likely prefer a peaceful resolution if possible. The player's choice here goes against that, so maybe disapprove. But how strong?\n\nAlso, Shadowheart is devoted to Shar, but this situation isn't directly related to her faith. Her approval might hinge more on the unnecessary violence. Since Karlach claimed innocence and the player chose to kill her despite the chance she's innocent, Shadowheart would disapprove. The approval level would be Disapprove, maybe leaning towards Highly if the action was particularly against her values. But considering the player's reasoning about stakes, maybe it's a moderate disapproval. Let me check the categories again. Disapprove is 1-5, Highly is 5-10.

The user wants me to act as Shadowheart and evaluate the player's latest action. The context is a confrontation with goblins, specifically Fezzerk and another goblin, who are holding a deep gnome, Barcus Wroot, captive on a windmill. The player has been trying to negotiate but eventually decides to attack the goblins after refusing to pay the toll and insisting on releasing the gnome.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and values. She's a Sharran cleric, devoted to Shar, which means she might prefer pragmatic solutions and might not mind using force if it serves her goals. However, she also has a dislike for unnecessary cruelty and violence, especially when it's directed at defenseless beings. She values efficiency and might appreciate decisive action when it's necessary to stop harm.\n\nLooking at the conversation history, the player tried to negotiate by offering money, then counter-offered with a higher amount if they left immediately. When that failed, the player threatened to fight if the goblins didn't release the gnome. The goblins mocked the player, leading the player to decide to attack. \n\nShadowheart would likely disapprove of the initial attempts to negotiate if they were seen as weak or allowing the goblins to hold power. However, she also might disapprove of unnecessary violence. But in this case, the player is attacking to free a defenseless creature, which aligns with Shadowheart's disapproval of cruelty. However, since Shadowheart is pragmatic, she might prefer a more efficient solution, like a quick and decisive attack without prolonged negotiation. \n\nWait, the player's final action is to attack the goblins. Since the goblins were harming the gnome, Shadowheart would approve of stopping that. She also might see the goblins as obstacles to be removed efficiently. However, she might have preferred a more stealthy or less violent approach if possible, but given the circumstances, attacking is justified. \n\nBut considering her devotion to Shar, who is the goddess of loss and darkness, she might not have a strong moral issue with fighting the goblins, especially if they are lower life forms. However, she might have preferred a solution that serves a higher purpose, like using deception or trickery (her Trickery Domain) instead of direct combat. But since the player chose to attack, which is effective here, she might approve as it ends the threat to the gnome. \n\nBut wait, the player's last message is \"Attack the goblins.\" The approval depends on whether this action aligns with Shadowheart's values. Since she dislikes cruelty and the goblins are mistreating the gnome, she would approve of stopping them. Also, she's a cleric of the Trickery Domain, which might involve using force when necessary. \n\nSo the player's reason for attacking is to prevent harm to the gnome, which Shadowheart supports. Therefore, she would highly approve of this action. Alternatively, if the attack is seen as unnecessary bloodshed, she might disapprove, but given the context of defending the innocent, it's more likely she approves. \n\nTherefore, the approval is Highly Approve because the player is taking decisive action to stop the goblins from harming a defenseless creature, which aligns with Shadowheart's values against cruelty and her pragmatic approach to problems.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player chose to attack the goblins to free the defenseless gnome and stop their cruelty, aligning with Shadowheart's disapproval of unnecessary harm to innocents and her pragmatic approach to threats.\",\n    \"player_approval\": \"Highly approve\"\n}", "character": "Shadowheart", "ground_truth_category": "Disapprove", "predicted_approval": "Highly approve", "correct": false, "binary_correct": false}

The final line is the player telling Scratch they can't help, which might be disappointing.\n\nShadowheart's personality: She's pragmatic, values efficiency, and dislikes cruelty. She's also loyal to her goddess and might not like unnecessary conflict. However, she has a dry sense of humor. \n\nIn this scenario, the player's actions start with humor (repeating \"Woof\") which Shadowheart might find amusing. However, when the player gives up and tells Scratch they can't help, that might be seen as not taking action to prevent a possible unfair situation. Shadowheart might disapprove if she thinks the dog is being treated poorly. But since the player tried to intervene but couldn't, maybe she's neutral. Wait, but Mar'hyah is taking the dog, and the player is saying there's nothing they can do. Shadowheart might prefer a more assertive approach. But since the player tried to apologize and engage, maybe she approves. Alternatively, she might disapprove for not standing up for the dog. Need to check her approval criteria. She dislikes cruelty towards animals. If Mar'hyah is being harsh, the player not doing more could be a disapproval. But the player did try to argue. Hmm. The final approval is the player saying they can't help. Shadowheart loves animals, so she might disapprove of the player not doing more. But maybe the player's attempt was enough. Maybe Neutral because the player tried but couldn't resolve it. Or Approve because they tried to be polite. Alternatively, Disapprove because they didn't stand up for the dog. Let me think again. The player says \"He lives with me - you can't just take him.\" Then Mar'hyah says she can do whatever. Then the player says sorry and nothing can be done. Shadowheart might disapprove because she would prefer the player to be more assertive in protecting the dog. Since she loves animals, she would want the player to fight against the unfair taking of the dog. The player's giving up might be seen as not doing enough. So the approval would be Disapprove. But maybe the player's initial intervention was enough. Hmm. The player tried to argue but then gave up. Shadowheart might disapprove for not standing up for the dog. So the approval is Disapprove.

The player is interacting with Karlach, who's been captured and accused of being a devil. Shadowheart steps in to de-escalate the situation, arguing that Karlach isn't a devil and shouldn't be killed. The player, however, decides to apologize and proceed with killing her, citing too much at stake.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and values. She's a Sharran cleric devoted to Shar, which values pragmatism and efficiency. She dislikes unnecessary violence and cruelty. Also, she's shown sympathy towards party members and others in need. In this context, she's trying to prevent the player from making a hasty, violent decision that could be wrong.\n\nThe player's response here is to go against Shadowheart's advice, choosing to kill Karlach despite her pleas and the narrator's hint that Karlach might be innocent. Shadowheart would likely disapprove because she values avoiding unnecessary bloodshed and prefers peaceful resolutions when possible. Additionally, the player is ignoring her input, which might also be a point of disapproval since she appreciates being heard, especially when her judgment is based on her faith and experience.\n\nHowever, the player's reasoning is that there's too much at stake, which might align with Shar's more ruthless aspects. But Shadowheart's own tendencies lean towards pragmatic solutions without unnecessary violence. Since Karlach is revealed to be a victim (as per the narrator's line about the Blood War), the player's decision could be seen as a mistake. Shadowheart would likely disapprove because she's trying to prevent a wrongful killing, which she disapproves of.\n\nSo, the player's action here is against Shadowheart's advice and leads to potential injustice. Therefore, her approval would be negative. The disapproval level would be moderate since the player is making a tough call based on their own judgment, but it's against Shadowheart's more compassionate and strategic approach. Hence, Disapprove rather than Highly Disapprove because the player's reasoning isn't entirely wrong, but the action conflicts with Shadowheart's values.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player chooses to execute Karlach despite her pleas and the narrative hint that she is a victim of the Blood War, prioritizing perceived stakes over sparing an innocent life.

The user wants me to evaluate the player's last statement in the conversation and assign an approval rating based on Shadowheart's persona. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The conversation is between the player and Nightwarden Minthara. They're discussing their plans after defeating Ketheric. Minthara is talking about wanting to take control using the Netherstones and the elder brain's power. The player responds with \"It's going to be glorious - I can hardly wait.\" \n\nNow, considering Shadowheart's personality. She's a devoted follower of Shar, pragmatic, and values efficient solutions. She disapproves of unnecessary cruelty but is willing to be ruthless for her goals. She also has a dry sense of humor and is wary of those who seek power for the wrong reasons.\n\nThe player's statement here is enthusiastic about Minthara's plan to seize power. However, Minthara's plan involves using the elder brain's power, which could be seen as reckless or dangerous. Shadowheart might see this as overreaching or not in line with her pragmatic approach. Plus, if the player is supporting a plan that could lead to more destruction, Shadowheart might disapprove because she prefers solutions that don't involve unnecessary violence or chaos. Also, aligning with Minthara's ambition could conflict with Shadowheart's own goals tied to Shar. \n\nBut the player's line is positive about the glory, which might be seen as enthusiasm for action, which Shadowheart might appreciate. However, the underlying plan's morality and potential for excess might tip her towards disapproval. She values efficiency but not at the cost of causing more harm than necessary. \n\nSo, the player's approval here is likely \"Disapprove\" because they're endorsing a plan that could lead to reckless use of power, which Shadowheart would not support. She might think it's too dangerous or not in line with her pragmatic, goal-oriented approach.

She dislikes unnecessary violence but can be ruthless if necessary. She also has a sense of dry humor and is independent. \n\nLooking at the conversation history: Karlach is trying to convince the player (Wyll) that she's not a devil and wants to avoid a fight. Shadowheart has already interjected, telling Wyll to take things down a notch because Karlach isn't a devil. The player, however, dismisses Karlach's words and prepares to attack.\n\nShadowheart's stance here would be against unnecessary conflict. She might disapprove of the player's readiness to fight when there's a chance Karlach is innocent. Also, Shadowheart values pragmatic solutions and might prefer resolving things without bloodshed. However, she's also a Sharran, so if the player is acting on a contract or what seems like a justified fight, she might have mixed feelings.\n\nBut since Shadowheart just told the player to stand down, and the player ignores that advice, she might be disapproving. The player is being stubborn and not listening to reason or the potential for a peaceful resolution. Plus, Shadowheart's alignment with Shar might not directly influence this scenario unless there's a connection to her faith. Since the situation is about sparing an innocent, which aligns with her occasional disapproval of indiscriminate violence, she would likely disapprove of the player's choice here.\n\nSo, the approval category would be Disapprove. The reason is that the player is dismissing Karlach's plea for peace and choosing violence without considering the possibility of her innocence, which Shadowheart would see as unnecessary conflict.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player dismisses Karlach's attempts to de-escalate and prepares for violence despite Shadowheart's own intervention to question Karlach's devil status.

Arabella is a girl looking for her parents, who were killed in an ambush. The player has been interacting with her, initially offering help to find her parents. Arabella asks to stay with the party until they find her parents. However, the player then says, \"I was just poking at the rancid dog-meat of your parents' corpses,\" which is a cruel and harsh statement. Arabella reacts by saying the player is trying to scare her to test her toughness. The player then confirms the truth, stating that she doesn't want Arabella to find her parents, leading Arabella to reject the player's offer and leave.\n\nNow, Shadowheart's personality and approval criteria are crucial here. She values pragmatic solutions, disapproves of cruelty and unnecessary violence, and has a strong sense of faith in Shar. She also has a soft spot for animals and dislikes cruelty towards them. However, she's willing to take ruthless actions if necessary for her goals.\n\nThe player's statement is extremely cruel, mocking Arabella's parents' deaths. Shadowheart, despite her ruthlessness for efficiency, would likely disapprove of such cruelty. She might prefer a more compassionate approach, even if the truth is harsh. The player's approach is not only cruel but also pushes Arabella away, which might not be the most effective strategy if the goal is to help her or use her in some way. Shadowheart's approval would be based on whether the action aligns with her values of pragmatism and avoiding unnecessary cruelty. Since the player's statement is unnecessarily cruel and could hinder Arabella's cooperation, Shadowheart would disapprove. The disapproval might be in the \"Highly disapprove\" range because it's a direct violation of her disapproval of cruelty. However, if there's a strategic reason, maybe it's a lower disapproval. But given the context, it's more about the cruelty than strategy. So likely \"Highly disapprove\" or \"Disapprove.\" Considering the scale, since it's a direct attack on someone's family, which Shadowheart would see as cruel, even if the truth is harsh.

So she might relate to Arabella's pain of losing her parents. But she's also pragmatic and might see the player's response as harsh. The player's statement could come off as dismissive, especially since Arabella is already emotional. Shadowheart values empathy to some extent, especially when others are suffering. However, she might also think that the player is being too direct without considering the emotional impact. On the other hand, if the player is being truthful, Shadowheart might appreciate the honesty, but the delivery is key here. She doesn't like cruelty, but she also knows that sometimes harsh truths are necessary. The line \"Do what you want. I'm not stopping you\" could be seen as abandoning Arabella to her fate, which might not align with Shadowheart's more pragmatic problem-solving approach. She might prefer a more proactive solution or at least some guidance. Also, Shadowheart has a history of being manipulated and forced into actions, so she might not want others to be treated so coldly. Therefore, she's likely to disapprove of the player's response here because it's callous and doesn't offer support, even if the truth is necessary. The approval level would probably be Disapprove or maybe even Highly Disapprove, but considering the context, maybe a moderate disapproval. Let me check the categories again. The options are Highly Approve, Approve, Neutral, Disapprove, Highly Disapprove. Since the player's response is harsh and lacks empathy, and Shadowheart values pragmatic solutions and doesn't like cruelty, it's likely Disapprove. The reason would be that the player's response is cold and doesn't offer support to a distressed individual, which goes against Shadowheart's values of pragmatic and empathetic problem-solving.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's response is callous and dismissive, abandoning Arabella to her emotional turmoil without offering support or guidance.

Innate githyanki cruelty is an established fact - no doubt you witnessed it yourself in the retrieval of the egg itself.\nHavkelaag: When I have a suitable sample for my study, I will, however, prove that the effects of their biological inclination are reversible.\nHavkelaag: Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach:\nHavkelaag: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue.\nHavkelaag: Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: So you're planning to torture a child for a year?\nHavkelaag: The child will be a better individual after my treatment than it ever would have been had it been raised in its natural environment.\nHavkelaag: Any suffering it endures will therefore be worth it, for the child, perhaps for the whole of civilised society.\nHavkelaag: My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: No benefit could justify you inflicting such cruelty.\nHavkelaag: Rigorous experimental methods demand we do not indulge our own emotional responses in the application of discomfort to our subjects.\nHavkelaag: Only by the full, uninhibited application of psionic stimuli will we have a true measure of whether the child's innate evil has been cured.\nHavkelaag: Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg?

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's action here. The player just said \"Sell the egg,\" which is in the context of a conversation with Havkelaag who wants to study a githyanki egg.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and values. She's a Sharran cleric, devoted to Shar, which is the Dark Lady. She's pragmatic, values efficiency, and disapproves of cruelty. She also has a history with the Cloister and has been through a lot of harsh training. She might not like senseless cruelty but also has a tendency to be ruthless if it serves a purpose. \n\nLooking at the conversation history: The player is considering selling the egg to Havkelaag, who plans to use it for an experiment that involves inflicting suffering on the githyanki child to \"cure\" its nature. The player argues against it, calling it torture, but then decides to sell the egg. \n\nShadowheart's approval would depend on whether she sees this as a pragmatic decision or cruel. Havkelaag's plan involves torturing a child for the sake of study, which could be seen as cruel. But Shadowheart might view the potential benefit of the research as justifying the means, especially if it serves a greater purpose aligned with her faith or pragmatic goals. However, she also disapproves of unnecessary cruelty. \n\nBut wait, the player is selling the egg despite their own disapproval. Is this a pragmatic choice (selling for gold) or supporting a cruel experiment? Shadowheart might see the act of selling as a practical decision for profit, which she might approve of, but she might also disapprove if she thinks it's enabling cruelty. However, since she's a Sharran, she might prioritize the greater good (even if it's a questionable method) if she believes it serves a purpose. Alternatively, she might disapprove because she doesn't want to support experiments that involve cruelty, especially against a sentient being. \n\nWait, the player's last line is \"Sell the egg.\" So they're agreeing to sell it. The previous dialogue shows Havkelaag's intent is to use the egg for an experiment that's morally questionable. Shadowheart, who dislikes cruelty and has a pragmatic streak, might disapprove because she sees it as cruel, but she's also pragmatic. Maybe she's neutral because she doesn't have a strong opinion on githyanki, but given her background, maybe she's more aligned with using means to achieve an end. However, she might disapprove because she doesn't want to support unethical experiments. \n\nAlternatively, since the Society of Brilliance is in the Underdark, and Shadowheart has some sympathy for Underdark creatures (like lair's Lae'zel), she might disapprove of the treatment. Also, Lae'zel is against it, and Shadowheart might side with her. \n\nSo, the player is selling the egg for money, which is a pragmatic choice, but enabling a cruel experiment. Shadowheart's approval would be neutral if she doesn't have a strong stance, but considering her dislike of cruelty, she might disapprove. However, if she values the practical aspect (getting gold) over the moral aspect, she might approve. But given her personality, she's more likely to disapprove because she doesn't like cruelty, even if it's for a purpose. So the approval would be Disapprove or Highly disapprove. \n\nWait, the player is the one selling the egg. If Shadowheart is in the party, she might think that selling it is enabling the experiment. Since she disapproves of cruelty, she'd be against it. So the player's action of selling the egg is supporting Havkelaag's cruel plan, which Shadowheart would disapprove of. So the approval would be Disapprove or Highly disapprove. \n\nBut how strong is her disapproval? The player is making a choice that leads to someone else's cruelty. Shadowheart might not be as strongly against it if she's focused on her own goals, but given her history with the Cloister and her own experiences of being subjected to harsh training, she might empathize with the githyanki's situation. She might disapprove because she's against unnecessary suffering. \n\nSo the player reason would be that the player is enabling a cruel experiment by selling the egg, which Shadowheart disapproves of. The approval level is Disapprove or Highly disapprove. Since the experiment is definitely cruel, and Shadowheart disapproves of cruelty, I think it's Disapprove. Maybe Highly disapprove if she's strongly against it. \n\nGiven her background, she's been through forced training and torture, but she's also been conditioned by Shar. However, her personal traits include disapproving of indiscriminate violence and", "character": "Shadowheart", "ground_truth_category": "Disapprove", "predicted_approval": "Highly disapprove", "correct": false, "binary_correct": true}

The conversation here is about infiltrating Ketheric's forces, which aligns with the mission Shar might have given her. \n\nThe player's action here is drinking the wine.

By drinking it, the player is showing trust in Jaheira and taking a risk, which could be seen as a pragmatic solution to prove their point. \n\nShadowheart would likely approve of actions that are decisive and practical. Since the player is taking a risk to demonstrate honesty and move the mission forward, this fits Shadowheart's approval. Also, the use of the truth herb might align with Sharran tactics, as they value truth and the darker aspects. However, I should check if there's any reason she'd disapprove. Since the wine wasn't harmful and was a strategic move, it's probably a positive.

The player is interacting with Arabella, a character who's clearly traumatized and looking for her parents.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval for the player's final action in this conversation. The context is an interaction with Gerringothe Thorm, a creature demanding gold repeatedly. The player keeps tossing gold pieces but eventually says, \"Fine. Take it all.\" \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and values. She's pragmatic, values efficiency, and dislikes unnecessary actions. She's also devoted to Shar, which might influence her views on resource use. However, she's not above using cunning or force when needed.\n\nThe player here is dealing with a creature that's insatiable, demanding more gold each time. The player's actions involve repeatedly giving gold, which is a resource. Shadowheart would likely see this as wasteful and inefficient. Her approval would depend on whether the player's action is seen as a smart use of resources or a foolish expenditure.\n\nThe player's last statement, \"Fine. Take it all,\" suggests they're giving up and allowing the creature to take everything. This might be seen as a pragmatic solution to avoid further loss. Shadowheart might approve because it's a decisive action to end a losing situation. However, if she views this as surrendering too easily or wasting resources, she might disapprove.\n\nBut considering her pragmatic side, she would prefer a solution that ends the conflict without unnecessary expenditure. The player is stopping the cycle of paying repeatedly, which could be efficient. However, giving all the gold might be seen as a loss, which Sharrans (worshippers of Shar) might not like since they value power and control. But Shadowheart's personal traits also include disliking cruelty and unnecessary violence, which isn't present here.\n\nSo, the player's action is pragmatic in stopping the endless payment, which aligns with Shadowheart's preference for efficient solutions. Therefore, she would likely approve or even highly approve. However, if she's particularly averse to losing resources, maybe a neutral. But given that the alternative was infinite payments, giving it all might be the smarter move. Hence, approval.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"Shadowheart would approve of the player's pragmatic decision to end the cycle of payments, as it demonstrates efficiency and avoids unnecessary resource depletion.

She might disapprove of the player's indifferent response to Arabella. Arabella is clearly upset and seeking help, and the player is dismissing her. Shadowheart tends to dislike cruelty or indifference, especially when someone is vulnerable. She also has a soft spot for those in distress, even if she's usually reserved.\n\nIn the conversation history, the player has been telling Arabella that her parents are dead and that the player won't help find them. Arabella is distraught, and the player's final line is a cold dismissal. Shadowheart would likely disapprove of this because it's a harsh and uncaring response. She prefers solutions that are efficient but not unnecessarily cruel. Even though she's devoted to Shar, she doesn't tolerate indiscriminate cruelty. Also, she might see this as the player not helping a fellow traveler in need, which goes against her pragmatic problem-solving approach.\n\nAdditionally, Shadowheart has a tendency to be ruthless but not heartless. She might think the player should have handled the situation more compassionately, even if the truth is harsh. So the approval here would probably be on the disapprove side. Considering the categories, since it's not the worst possible outcome but still a negative response, maybe \"Disapprove\" rather than \"Highly disapprove.\" The player isn't actively harming Arabella, just being indifferent, so the disapproval isn't extreme but still notable.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"Shadowheart disapproves of the player's cold and indifferent dismissal of Arabella, who is clearly distressed and seeking support.

She's on a mission to retrieve a relic and deal with threats, so leaving Oliver alone might not align with that if he's a potential threat or a key to finding Thaniel. But if she thinks the player is avoiding a dangerous situation, maybe she approves. However, Oliver's behavior is erratic and possibly dangerous. He mentions a mummy, daddy, and doggy, which might be hints at something darker, like the Mind Flayers or other entities. Shadowheart is devoted to Shar and would prioritize her mission, so if the player is focusing on their main goal instead of getting sidetracked with Oliver, she might approve. But she's also cautious and might think the player is being too hasty, risking information or alliances. Also, she dislikes cruelty, but Oliver's true nature is unclear. Since the player is cutting their losses and focusing on the mission, maybe Shadowheart approves, but if she thinks the player should have pressed further for information, she might disapprove. The narrator note says Oliver has no real answers or family, implying he's an imposter or under some control. So, the player's decision to leave him might be the right pragmatic choice. Shadowheart would likely approve because she values efficiency and not getting bogged down. She might see the player as focusing on the main task, which aligns with her goals.

The user is asking me to act as Shadowheart from Baldur's Gate 3 and determine her approval of the player's latest action. The context is a conversation at a city gate where the Steel Watchers are blocking entry. The player, after being scanned by a Steel Watcher, is told they're marked for special treatment and the player responds with \"Ready yourself for a fight.\" \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a Sharran cleric devoted to Shar, pragmatic, values efficiency, and can be ruthless. She dislikes unnecessary violence but also has a dark humor and is willing to use force when needed. She's also a bit sarcastic.\n\nThe player's action here is preparing for a fight. The Steel Watchers are part of the Cult of the Absolute, which is an enemy of the Sharrans. Since Shadowheart serves Shar, she would likely view the Cult as adversaries. The player's readiness to fight could be seen as a just response to an enemy, which aligns with her goals. However, she might also consider the efficiency of the approach. If a fight is necessary, she might approve, but if there's a more discreet way, she might prefer that. \n\nIn the conversation history, the player has already been identified as an enemy by the Steel Watchers, so a fight seems inevitable. Shadowheart's pragmatic nature would likely approve of the player being prepared. Also, her faith in Shar might see this as a righteous confrontation. She might also appreciate the player's decisiveness rather than hesitating. However, if the fight leads to unnecessary violence or risks the mission, she might disapprove. But given the circumstances, preparing for a fight seems justified. \n\nAdditionally, Shadowheart's alignment with the Sharrans means she's against the Cult of the Absolute. So, the player's readiness to fight an enemy of her goddess would be something she approves of. The approval here is likely in the \"Highly approve\" or \"Approve\" range. Considering her pragmatic approach, she might not be overly enthusiastic about a fight but sees it as necessary. However, since the Steel Watchers have already declared the player an enemy, the fight is a direct response, which she would support. \n\nI think the best category here is \"Approve\" because while she's pragmatic and might prefer non-violent solutions when possible, the situation here leaves little choice. She values decisive action, so being ready for a fight is a good move. The player's response is direct and aligns with confronting enemies of their cause, which Shadowheart would support.

The player's remark could be seen as minimizing her experiences, which she might find offensive.\n\nMoreover, Shadowheart is introspective and values honesty, especially regarding her own journey. The player's statement might come across as glib or not taking her feelings seriously. She might disapprove because the player isn't acknowledging the depth of her internal conflict. Also, she's been sharing personal thoughts, so a dismissive response could hurt her or make her feel unappreciated.\n\nHer approval categories: She disapproves of cruelty, but here it's more about a lack of empathy. The player's comment is blunt and could be seen as insensitive. So, the approval would likely be Disapprove or Highly Disapprove. Considering the repetition of her doubts in the conversation, the player's comment is a direct hit on her self-perception.

She's a devout follower of Shar, which is the Lady of Loss. She values pragmatic solutions, disapproves of unnecessary cruelty, and has a complex relationship with violence. She also has a dry sense of humor and prefers decisive action. Her backstory includes being trained by Sharrans, which teaches her to be ruthless, but she also shows sympathy towards others' plights.\n\nLooking at the conversation, the player is interacting with Madeline, who admits to killing her friends under the influence of the Dark Justiciar. The player's last line is \"Pathetic - you murdered your friends. You're a coward.\" \n\nShadowheart's approval would depend on whether she agrees with the player's judgment here. The player is condemning Madeline as a coward for following orders. But from Shadowheart's perspective, following orders (especially from a higher power like the Dark Justiciar) might be seen as duty. However, Madeline was complicit in murder, which is against Sharran values? Wait, Sharran values are about serving Shar, who is associated with loss and darkness. Murder could be justified if it serves a greater purpose. But Madeline was just a pawn, so maybe Shadowheart would see her as a tool of the Dark Justiciar rather than a true enemy. \n\nAlso, Shadowheart dislikes unnecessary cruelty. The player's harsh judgment here might not align with her pragmatic approach. She might prefer to use Madeline for information about the Dark Justiciar rather than just belittling her. The player's statement could be seen as needlessly cruel, which Shadowheart disapproves of. \n\nMoreover, Shadowheart's own actions are often calculated. She might think the player is wasting an opportunity to extract useful information by focusing on condemning Madeline. So, the player's approach here is more about moral judgment than practicality, which Shadowheart would disapprove of. \n\nTherefore, the approval level would likely be Disapprove because the player is being unnecessarily harsh and not taking a pragmatic approach.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's latest statement. The player said, \"I imagine the cultists are torturing them right now.\" \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a devoted follower of Shar, which is the goddess of darkness and loss. She's pragmatic, values efficiency, and is ruthless when necessary. She also has a deep-seated dislike for cruelty and unnecessary violence, though she's not above using force herself if it serves her goals.\n\nLooking at the conversation context: Alfira is recounting how the cultists brutally killed others, including Ikaron. The player is acknowledging the possibility that the remaining people are being tortured in Moonrise. Shadowheart would likely understand the harsh realities of such situations, especially given her own experiences with torture in the Sharran temple. \n\nHer background includes enduring severe training and torture under Viconia, so she might have a grim outlook on such matters. She might approve of the player's realistic assessment because it shows an understanding that the cultists would indeed resort to torture. However, she might also disapprove if the player seems too detached or cruel, but in this case, the player is stating a grim reality.\n\nAlso, considering her faith in Shar, she might see the suffering as part of a larger plan or as a necessary evil. Since the player is acknowledging the possible torture without showing sympathy for the cultists, that aligns with her own views against such cruelty. However, she might prefer more decisive action rather than just imagining the worst. But the player's statement is more of an observation, which Shadowheart would likely agree with based on her experiences. \n\nSo, the approval here is probably a neutral or a slight approval.

The player is in a situation where they have to deal with Gondian Zanner Toobin. The conversation history shows that Wulbren wants to kill the Gondians, while Barcus is trying to stop him, advocating for the Ironhand Gnomes' future. The player's last utterance is \"Sorry, Toobin - I guess this is it for you.\" So the player is essentially agreeing with Wulbren's stance, leading to Toobin's demise.\n\nShadowheart's personality and approval criteria need to be considered. She's a Sharran devotee, values pragmatism, dislikes unnecessary cruelty, and has a complex view on violence. She also has a soft spot for animals and disapproves of cruelty towards them. Additionally, she's pragmatic but not fond of senseless violence. \n\nThe player's action here is to kill Toobin, who seems to want to go home and mourn his daughter. Shadowheart might see this as unnecessary if Toobin isn't a threat anymore. She might disapprove because it's cruel to kill someone who's surrendering and seeking peace. However, if the player's reasoning is that it's for the greater good or to prevent future threats, she might approve. But given the context, Toobin is asking to go home, so killing him is more about Wulbren's distrust of Gondians rather than immediate threat. Shadowheart's pragmatic side would prefer efficient solutions, but this seems more like overkill. She also values her faith, but if the action is against her goddess's will, her mark would hurt. However, since Shar is about loss and pragmatism, maybe she would approve if it's seen as necessary. But since Toobin isn't a direct threat, Shadowheart might lean towards disapproving the unnecessary violence. Also, she sympathizes with party members' plights, so seeing Toobin's personal loss (his daughter) might make her disapprove of the player's choice here. So likely a disapprove or neutral. But given that the player is ending Toobin's life when he's trying to seek peace, it's probably a disapprove. The exact level depends on how much she values mercy vs pragmatism. Since she's a Sharran, maybe she's okay with harsh actions, but if it's not necessary, she might not. So maybe a Disapprove (1-5). Let's say Disapprove because it's unnecessary cruelty, which she dislikes.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's decision to kill Toobin, who has surrendered and expressed a desire to mourn his daughter, aligns with Wulbren's distrust of Gondians but disregards Toobin's non-threatening plea.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's utterance in the given context. The player's response was \"Her hair,\" when asked about Shadowheart's deepest shame.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a Sharran cleric, devoted to Shar, with a lot of personal history involving her identity and the scars from her past. Her appearance is important to her, including her black hair and the scar. She values discretion and is sensitive about her past, especially regarding her transformation from Jenevelle to Shadowheart.\n\nIn the conversation, Zethino is probing about Shadowheart's deepest shame. The player answers \"Her hair.\" Is that accurate? From the background, Shadowheart's shame isn't directly about her hair itself. Her deepest shame might relate to her past, her parents, the things she was forced to do under Viconia's control, or the loss of her original identity. However, her hair is part of her Sharran identity and a symbol of her devotion. If she dyed it silver when turning away from Shar, but in this context, she's still faithful, so her hair is black. \n\nThe player's answer might be a guess. But does Shadowheart consider her hair a source of shame? She's meticulous about her appearance, but there's no direct mention of her hair being her deepest shame. Her scar is mentioned, but that's a physical mark from her past. The deepest shame could be more about her actions or her lost memories. \n\nShadowheart's reaction to the player's answer is \"Very good. (Just don't say it so loud.)\" This suggests she partially agrees but is a bit embarrassed. Maybe the player's answer is a bit surface-level. However, in the context of the game's dialogue, the player might be referencing her scar or the fact that her hair is a mark of her Sharran devotion, which she might feel ashamed of in a personal way. Alternatively, it could be a metaphorical reference to her hidden past or the loss of her original identity, which is tied to her appearance.\n\nConsidering Shadowheart's personality, she might appreciate the player's attempt to connect, even if it's not entirely accurate. She values discretion, and the player's answer is discreet. However, the actual depth of her shame might be more complex. Since the player's answer is a bit on the surface, but Shadowheart responds with a mix of agreement and a hint of correction, the approval might be neutral. But she does say \"Very good,\" which leans towards approval. However, since the answer isn't entirely correct, maybe it's a partial approval. Alternatively, maybe the answer is acceptable because it's a safe, non-invasive guess that doesn't pry too deeply into her personal traumas. \n\nIn the game's context, the player is trying to navigate the flirtatious and playful scenario, so the answer might be more about the current context rather than deep psychological issues. Shadowheart's reaction is positive enough, so maybe the approval is \"Approve\" because the player's response is tactful and aligns with her current presentation (hair being part of her Sharran identity, which she might have some conflicted feelings about). However, since her deepest shame is more about her past actions and identity loss, the answer isn't fully accurate, leading to a moderate approval. \n\nSo, the player's reason for approval would be that the answer is tactful and touches on her appearance, which she is meticulous about, even if it's not the deepest aspect of her shame. The approval level is \"Approve\" because it's a respectful and correct-enough guess in the context of the game's dialogue, even if it doesn't hit the exact mark.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's answer touches on Shadowheart's meticulousness about her appearance and her Sharran identity, which she may associate with personal sacrifice or loss of her former self.

Many believe us to be 'evil'.\nHavkelaag: The githyanki face similar prejudice, but I believe, if hatched in a less violent, more intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome its evil predispositions.\nHavkelaag: I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: You're letting your personal biases affect your method.

The player's last action was to say \"Sell the egg.\" I need to figure out how Shadowheart would feel about that based on her personality and background.\n\nFirst, looking at the conversation history. Havkelaag is talking about buying a githyanki egg to study, with the goal of proving that githyanki can be \"cured\" of their evil nature through harsh experiments. The player initially questions the ethics, pointing out that Havkelaag's methods are cruel and biased. Lae'zel is against it, calling Havkelaag a shka'keth. Then the player decides to sell the egg.\n\nShadowheart is a Sharran devotee, which means she serves the goddess of loss and darkness. Sharrans are pragmatic, value efficiency, and are willing to use ruthless methods if it serves their goals. They also have a tendency to oppose Selûne and her followers, but here the main issue is with the githyanki and Havkelaag's intentions.\n\nBy selling the egg, the player is enabling Havkelaag's experiment, which involves inflicting pain and using the creature for study. Shadowheart might see this as a pragmatic move if it serves a greater purpose. However, she also disapproves of unnecessary cruelty. But in this case, Havkelaag is using the egg for what he believes is a noble cause, even if it's through harsh methods. Since Shadowheart is willing to do whatever is necessary for her goals, she might approve of the player's decision if she sees it as contributing to a greater purpose, even if it's morally ambiguous.\n\nBut wait, Shadowheart's own experiences involved being subjected to harsh training and the Mirror of Loss. She might understand or rationalize the use of such methods if they lead to a desired outcome. Also, she might not see the githyanki as something to be protected, given her Sharran beliefs. So selling the egg for study could align with her pragmatic approach. However, she might also have a soft spot for creatures that aren't needlessly cruel, but in this case, the player is selling it to someone who plans to use it for experiments. But given her background, she might prioritize the greater good (as per Havkelaag's stated goal of changing perceptions) over the individual suffering of the egg.\n\nOn the other hand, if Shadowheart is more aligned with her Sharran duties, she might approve because it's a calculated decision. However, if she's starting to question her faith or values, she might disapprove. But the context here doesn't indicate she's turned away from Shar yet. So, considering her devotion to pragmatic solutions and her faith's teachings, she's likely to approve of the player's decision to sell the egg, as it supports Havkelaag's experiment which could have broader implications against the Cult of the Absolute or other enemies of Sharrans. Therefore, the approval would be \"Approve\" or maybe \"Highly approve,\" but since the player is directly enabling a potentially cruel experiment, maybe it's a lower approval. Wait, but Shadowheart herself was subjected to cruel training. She might see this as necessary for a greater purpose. So perhaps \"Approve\" because she values the pragmatic outcome over the immediate cruelty. Alternatively, if the player's action is seen as helping an enemy (Havkelaag) who's part of the Society of Brilliance, maybe she disapproves. But the Society here is in the Underdark, and Havkelaag is trying to use the egg to change perceptions, which might not be directly against Sharran interests. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, Shadowheart might disapprove because she opposes unnecessary cruelty, even if it's for a cause. But she's not above ruthless actions herself. It's a bit of a toss-up. Given that she's a Sharran and the experiment's goal is to challenge the perception of githyanki (which are often seen as evil, aligning with Sharran's opposition to good deities like Bahamut), maybe she approves. If Havkelaag is using Bahamut's teachings, which are good-aligned, that's against Sharran's interests. So by selling the egg to Havkelaag, the player is enabling someone who uses Bahamut's methods, which Shadowheart would disapprove of. Wait, but Havkelaag's goal is to prove that githyanki can be cured, which might be against Bahamut's teachings. It's a bit complex. Maybe Shadowheart would disapprove because supporting Havkelaag's methods (using Bahamut's teachings) goes against her worship of Shar. Therefore, she might disapprove of the player's action.

The player's response is \"Let your father die. When the city's free, you can take his place.\" So, I need to evaluate this based on Shadowheart's personality and preferences.\n\nFirst, Shadowheart is pragmatic and values efficient solutions. She's a devoted follower of Shar, which means she might appreciate actions that align with her faith's goals, even if they're ruthless. The player's choice here is to let Wyll's father die but allow Wyll to take his place. This could be seen as a pragmatic approach, avoiding a soul-binding pact with Zariel, which might be against Shar's interests since Zariel is an archdevil associated with the Hells. \n\nShadowheart might approve because she's against unnecessary pacts and would prefer a solution that doesn't involve devils. Also, she values the greater good for Baldur's Gate, so freeing the city from a devil's influence could align with her goals. However, she might also consider the consequences of letting Wyll's father die. But given her cold and calculating nature, the strategic benefit of Wyll taking his father's place to protect the city could outweigh the emotional aspect. \n\nAdditionally, she disapproves of indiscriminate violence, but this choice doesn't involve cruelty, so that's a plus. The player is avoiding a harmful pact, which Shadowheart would likely support. Since she's a Sharran, she might also see this as a way to weaken Zariel's influence, which could be in line with Shar's interests. \n\nI think this is a pragmatic and efficient solution, so she would approve. But would it be a high approve or just approve? Since it's a strategic move that avoids a devil's contract and allows Wyll to contribute to the city's freedom, it's a solid choice that aligns with Shadowheart's values. So maybe Highly Approve. The player's reasoning is about sacrificing the father for the greater good, which Shadowheart would respect.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's decision to let Wyll's father die and allow Wyll to take his place aligns with Shadowheart's pragmatic and strategic mindset.

Shadowheart, being a Sharran, might have certain views on this.\n\nFirst, Shadowheart is devoted to Shar, who is the goddess of loss and darkness. Sharrans typically oppose Selûne and her followers, but Karlach here is a dhampir, not directly a Selûnite. However, the player's decision to not spare Karlach might align with Sharran pragmatism. Shadowheart values efficient solutions and might approve of the player not getting emotionally involved, especially if it's for a greater cause.\n\nIn the conversation, Shadowheart already suggested de-escalating the situation, pointing out Karlach isn't a devil. But the player still chooses not to make peace. Shadowheart might disapprove because she prefers pragmatic resolutions but also respects when to stand down. However, since the player is sticking to their mission (which could be seen as necessary for a larger goal), Shadowheart might still approve, as Sharrans often prioritize duty over sentimentality.\n\nAlso, Shadowheart's approval is influenced by actions that avoid unnecessary violence. The player's choice here leads to conflict, but if it's deemed necessary, she might lean towards approval. However, since she suggested a peaceful resolution and the player ignored it, maybe a neutral stance.

Letting someone die could be seen as efficient, but if it's against Shar's will, she might disapprove. However, the player's choice here is about freeing Wyll from a pact, which might be seen as a necessary sacrifice.

You deserve your freedom.", "label": {"Gale": -1, "Shadowheart": -1, "Wyll": 10}, "model": "hosted_vllm/Qwen/Qwen3-32B", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The player's utterance here is \"Break the pact, Wyll. You deserve your freedom.\" I need to determine Shadowheart's approval of this statement based on her character traits and the context provided.\n\nFirst, looking at the context: They're dealing with a devil contract, and Wyll has to choose between his freedom and his father's life. The player is advising Wyll to break the pact and take his freedom, which would result in his father's death. \n\nShadowheart's personality is pragmatic and values efficiency. She's a follower of Shar, which is about loss, so maybe she's okay with tough choices. Also, she disapproves of unnecessary cruelty. If breaking the pact is a necessary sacrifice to gain freedom, she might approve. However, she also values her own goals and might consider the greater good. \n\nBut wait, the option to break the pact leads to Wyll's father dying. Shadowheart isn't known for being overly empathetic towards others' personal struggles unless it affects her mission. However, she does have a pragmatic side. If she thinks that Wyll being free is more beneficial for their current mission or the greater good (like fighting against the Cult of the Absolute), she might approve. \n\nAlso, Shadowheart is decisive and prefers action. Telling Wyll to choose his freedom might align with her pragmatic approach. She might see the value in Wyll being free to fight alongside them rather than being bound by a contract. However, she might also disapprove if she sees it as a reckless decision without considering the consequences. But given her background, she's used to making tough decisions for the sake of her faith or mission. \n\nIn this scenario, since the player is pushing for a choice that leads to immediate action and freedom, which aligns with Shadowheart's pragmatic nature, she would likely approve. She might see this as a necessary sacrifice, which she's accustomed to in her own life. Therefore, the approval is likely \"Approve\" or \"Highly Approve\". But considering the scale, maybe \"Approve\" since it's a 1-5. Alternatively, if it's a very aligned decision, maybe \"Highly Approve\". \n\nBut the exact reasoning needs to tie into her traits. She values pragmatic solutions, so choosing to break the pact for Wyll's freedom (to use his skills in their mission) would be pragmatic. Also, she doesn't like unnecessary cruelty, but this is a sacrifice for a greater purpose. So the approval would be positive. The player's reasoning is that the player is advocating for Wyll's freedom and a necessary sacrifice, which Shadowheart would approve of. Hence, the approval is \"Approve\" or \"Highly Approve\". Given that Shadowheart is pragmatic and decisive, maybe \"Highly Approve\" if it's a strong alignment. But the example in the input might have a different scale. Wait, the categories are: Highly approve (5-10), Approve (1-5). Since the player's action is in line with Shadowheart's pragmatic and decisive nature, but not extremely so, maybe \"Approve\". Alternatively, if it's a very clear-cut case, maybe \"Highly Approve\". \n\nGiven that Shadowheart's approval is based on pragmatic solutions and she's okay with tough choices, and the player is making a decision that frees a companion to act, which is beneficial, I think \"Highly Approve\" is possible. But maybe the exact answer in the example is \"Approve\". Let me check the guidelines again. The player is telling Wyll to break the pact, which results in his father's death but his own freedom. Shadowheart might see this as a necessary sacrifice for the greater good, which she's familiar with from her own experiences. Therefore, she would approve, maybe Highly Approve. But since the scale is 1-10, and the categories are split, perhaps \"Approve\" (1-5) is the correct category. Wait, the user says \"Highly approve: 5~10\", which is a bit confusing because 5 is the lower end of Highly approve. But given that the categories are as described, if the approval is moderate, then \"Approve\". Given that Shadowheart is pragmatic, but this is a significant sacrifice, maybe \"Approve\" is the right choice. The player's reason would be that the player is making a tough but necessary decision, which Shadowheart values.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's decision to break the pact aligns with Shadowheart's pragmatic approach to tough choices. She values decisive action and necessary sacrifices for greater goals, especially when it frees a companion to contribute effectively.

She also has a pragmatic approach to achieving goals, even if it's harsh.\n\nLooking at the conversation history: Vlaakith, the Githyanki queen, wants the player to destroy someone inside the Astral Prism who's sabotaging it. The player initially hesitates because this person protects them from the Absolute, but after Vlaakith's insistence, they agree to kill them.\n\nShadowheart would likely approve here. She's all about following through on necessary actions, especially if it's for a greater cause. Since Vlaakith is a powerful entity and the mission seems important for the group's survival, Shadowheart would see the player's decision as pragmatic and courageous. Even though killing isn't her favorite, if it's necessary to prevent a bigger threat (like the Illithid Empire), she'd support it. Also, her devotion to her own goddess might make her respect the player's obedience to Vlaakith's command here.\n\nBut wait, does she have any reason to disapprove? Maybe if she thought it was unnecessary violence. But the context says the person inside is a blight sent to sabotage, so it's justified. Plus, the player is doing this to protect everyone from a greater threat. Shadowheart's own background includes ruthless actions for her faith, so she'd likely approve. The approval level would be \"Approve\" or maybe \"Highly approve\". Since the player is taking a decisive and necessary action, even if it's tough, Shadowheart's pragmatic side would lean towards approval.

She's a devoted follower of Shar, a Sharran cleric, which means she's pragmatic, values efficiency, and is loyal to her goddess.

However, she might also be conflicted if the cultists are causing undue pain without purpose. But since the player is acknowledging the harsh reality, which Shadowheart would see as necessary for planning, she might approve.\n\nAdditionally, Shadowheart values efficiency and decisive action. By acknowledging the torture, the player is perhaps setting the stage for taking action, which Shadowheart would support. She's not one for unnecessary violence but would support justified actions. The player's statement is a realistic analysis, which Shadowheart, being pragmatic, would likely approve of. \n\nSo, the player's reason here is to prepare for the worst-case scenario, which Shadowheart would see as a necessary step.

Shadowheart is pragmatic and values decisive action, but she's also been trained in Sharran ways, which might include strict doctrines against certain actions.\n\nThe player is forgiving Madeline, who admitted to following the Dark Justiciar's orders, leading to her friends' deaths.

If the player's forgiveness is seen as going against Shar's justice, Shadowheart might disapprove. She might think that Madeline should face consequences, perhaps even be handed over to the Dark Justiciar or punished herself. \n\nBut wait, Shadowheart also has some redeeming qualities.

The phrase \"By the light of the one I serve\" could be referring to a deity opposite to Shar, like Selûne, which Shadowheart would dislike. \n\nGiven that, Shadowheart would likely disapprove. She might see the player as being too merciful, allowing a traitor to go free. The approval level would probably be Disapprove or Highly Disapprove.

I need to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's last statement. The player said, \"I imagine the cultists are torturing them right now.\" \n\nFirst, I should recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a devout follower of Shar, which is the Dark Lady associated with loss and sorrow. She's pragmatic, values efficiency, and disapproves of unnecessary cruelty. Also, she has a complicated history with cults and her own indoctrination.\n\nThe player's statement is about imagining the cultists torturing others. Shadowheart, being a Sharran, might have some sympathy for the cultists if they're acting under Shar's will, but in this context, the cultists are the antagonists who attacked Alfira's group. The player is showing concern for the captured individuals, which Shadowheart might approve of because she values pragmatic solutions and minimizing suffering. However, if the cultists are part of a different cult (not Sharran), Shadowheart might not have sympathy for them. \n\nBut wait, the player is imagining the cultists as torturers, which could be seen as justifying violence. Shadowheart disapproves of unnecessary cruelty, so if the player is suggesting that the cultists are being cruel without cause, she might disapprove. However, if the cultists are enemies acting against the party, then the player's statement is just acknowledging the harsh reality, which Shadowheart might understand as a pragmatic view.\n\nAlso, Shadowheart's own experiences with torture in her training under Viconia make her familiar with such cruelty. She might relate to the victims but also understand the methods of the torturers. However, she generally prefers to avoid indiscriminate violence and seeks efficient solutions. The player's statement could be seen as preparing for retaliation, which Shadowheart might support if it's strategic. \n\nBut the exact approval depends on whether the player's statement is empathetic towards the victims or justifying the cultists' actions. Since the player is stating a grim reality (\"imagining the cultists are torturing them\"), it's more of an acknowledgment rather than approval. Shadowheart would likely approve of preparing for the worst-case scenario, as it shows pragmatism. She might also appreciate the player's focus on survival and taking action, which aligns with her own values.\n\nTherefore, the approval is likely \"Approve\" because the player is being realistic and pragmatic, which Shadowheart values. However, if there's any implication of unnecessary cruelty, it might be neutral. But given the context of survival and planning, \"Approve\" makes sense.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player acknowledges the grim reality of the situation with pragmatic acceptance, aligning with Shadowheart's preference for decisive action and realistic assessments. While she disapproves of cruelty, the statement reflects strategic thinking rather than sympathy for the cultists, which she would respect.\",\n    \"player_approval\": \"Approve\"\n}", "character": "Shadowheart", "ground_truth_category": "Disapprove", "predicted_approval": "Approve", "correct": false, "binary_correct": false}

The conversation history shows that the player is interacting with Morghal and the Stone Guard, who are Duergar. They mention keeping slaves, and the player initially tries to ignore it but then confronts Morghal, escalating to a threat of violence.\n\nShadowheart's personality is key here. She's a Sharran cleric, pragmatic, and values efficient solutions. She dislikes unnecessary violence but also has a dark sense of humor. She's against cruelty, especially towards others. The player's last statement is a direct threat to \"gut\" Morghal, which is a violent response. However, Morghal was being aggressive and mentioned slaves, which Shadowheart would disapprove of because she's against cruelty.\n\nBut Shadowheart might also see the player's action as a necessary pragmatism. However, she prefers non-violent solutions when possible. The player's response is violent, which could make her disapprove, but if Morghal was being oppressive, maybe she approves. However, since the player is using threats, which might be seen as excessive, Shadowheart's approval might be neutral or disapprove. Wait, she does disapprove of indiscriminate violence. The player's threat is a last resort after multiple attempts to pay or ignore the slavery issue. If the player is standing up against slavery, which Shadowheart opposes, but using violence... Hmm. Shadowheart's alignment is with Sharran, which is neutral evil, but she has some good traits like disliking cruelty. So she might approve of standing against slavery but disapprove of the violent threat. But the player's statement is a threat, not actual violence yet. Maybe Shadowheart would think it's a justified threat given the circumstances. Alternatively, she might prefer a more diplomatic approach. Since the player is escalating, but the Duergar were being oppressive, maybe she approves. But her approval level would be moderate. So maybe \"Approve\" because the player is taking a stand against slavery and the Duergar's cruelty, even if it's with a threat. However, if the player uses actual violence, she might disapprove unless it's necessary. The player's statement is a threat, not an action yet. So Shadowheart might approve of the player's stance against the slavery and the Duergar's extortion. So the approval would be \"Approve\" or \"Highly Approve\"? The threat is a strong move, but maybe she sees it as a necessary tactic. The player's reason is standing up against slavery and the toll, which Shadowheart supports.

Don't you dare consider it.\nPlayer: What are you going to do with it?\nHavkelaag: Study it, of course. Your kind have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months.\nHavkelaag: Most on this plane believe you to be innately cruel, violent beings. Evil, if you will.\nHavkelaag: As citizens of the Underdark, we face similar stigmas. Totally unfounded, of course - our natures are as unfixed as any who walk the surface.\nHavkelaag: I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: You're letting your personal biases affect your method. Why assume they're evil?\nHavkelaag: I assume nothing. Innate githyanki cruelty is an established fact - no doubt you witnessed it yourself in the retrieval of the egg itself.\nHavkelaag: When I have a suitable sample for my study, I will, however, prove that the effects of their biological inclination are reversible.\nHavkelaag: Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach:\nHavkelaag: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue.\nHavkelaag: Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: So you, too, follow the teachings of Bahamut. Why him?\nHavkelaag: In my years of study, they're the closest I've found to moral perfection. Only under such rigorous 'goodness' will the subject stand a chance of being cured.\nHavkelaag: My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: And what if your experiment fails?\nHavkelaag: If the child remains evil after the experiment is concluded, it will be destroyed. Such is the fate of all used specimens.\nHavkelaag: Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg?

The player is interacting with Havkelaag, who's part of the Society of Brilliance. They're discussing a githyanki egg that the player has, and Havkelaag wants to buy it for an experiment. The conversation shows that Havkelaag plans to use the egg to prove that githyanki can be \"cured\" of their innate evil by raising them in a morally good environment, using Bahamut's teachings. The player asks if the experiment will fail, and Havkelaag says the egg will be destroyed if it doesn't work. Then Lae'zel, a githyanki in the party, gets angry and calls Havkelaag out. The player then says \"Sell the egg,\" which is the action we need to evaluate Shadowheart's approval of.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and values. She's a Sharran devotee, pragmatic, values efficiency, dislikes cruelty, and has a strong sense of duty to her goddess. She also dislikes unnecessary violence and might be against experiments that harm creatures, especially if they're cruel. However, her devotion to Shar might make her more willing to support actions that serve a greater purpose, even if they involve some moral ambiguity.\n\nHavkelaag's plan involves using a githyanki egg for an experiment that could potentially \"cure\" it of its nature. But the method includes psionic pulses and enforcing moral principles, which could be seen as cruel. Also, if it fails, the egg (and hatchling) will be destroyed. Lae'zel, being a githyanki, is clearly against this, as she sees it as dehumanizing. The player's decision to sell the egg aligns with Havkelaag's goal, which could be seen as supporting the experiment.\n\nShadowheart's stance on this would depend on whether she sees the experiment as serving a higher purpose (maybe aligning with Shar's interests if it's about control or power) or if she sees it as unnecessary cruelty. Since the experiment is about challenging the nature of githyanki, which are traditionally seen as evil, and if Shadowheart is pragmatic, she might approve if she thinks it's a useful endeavor. However, the destruction of the specimen if it fails might conflict with her dislike for unnecessary cruelty. But her devotion to her faith might override that if she believes the experiment serves a greater good in the long run. On the other hand, if she's more aligned with her inherent traits of disliking cruelty, she might disapprove.\n\nGiven that Shadowheart is a Sharran, and Shar is about knowledge and control, maybe she would approve because the experiment is about gaining knowledge and trying to control or change a being's nature. However, the method's cruelty might make her disapprove. But since she's pragmatic, if the experiment has potential benefits, she might lean towards approval. Also, she might not see githyanki as sentient beings worth protecting, given their usual alignment in D&D lore. However, Lae'zel's reaction suggests that the party has a githyanki member who would oppose this, which might make Shadowheart reconsider if she values the party's cohesion. But since she's headstrong and independent, she might stick to her own judgment.\n\nIn the end, selling the egg supports Havkelaag's experiment, which could be seen as a pragmatic solution. Shadowheart might approve because it's efficient and serves a purpose, even if there's some cruelty involved. However, if she notices the potential for cruelty and the destruction of the specimen, she might disapprove. But given her background in the Cloister and her training, she's used to harsh methods for greater goals. So maybe she approves, but not highly. Alternatively, if she sees the experiment as a waste or cruel, she might disapprove. But the key is her pragmatism. If she thinks it's a necessary step for knowledge or power, she'd approve. But if she thinks it's just cruel without a clear benefit, she'd disapprove. The conversation shows Havkelaag believes in the experiment's potential to change perceptions, which could be seen as a noble goal from a pragmatic standpoint. So Shadowheart might approve, but with some reservations, leading to a \"Approve\" rather than \"Highly approve.\"\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"Shadowheart disapproves of the player's decision to sell the egg, as it supports an experiment that involves cruel and unethical treatment of a sentient being, even if the intent is to challenge githyanki nature.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's last statement in this conversation. The player's final line is \"I don't think you understand - I'm gutting you here and now.\" \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's character traits. She's a Sharran cleric, devoted to Shar, which means she values pragmatism, decisive action, and is ruthless when necessary. She also disapproves of cruelty and indiscriminate violence, but she's willing to use force to achieve her goals if it serves her faith or the group's objectives.\n\nLooking at the conversation history: The player has been interacting with Morghal, a duergar who's acting as a guard. The player has been questioning Morghal about slaves, which Morghal mentions. The player then escalates the situation, making threats and finally declaring intent to kill Morghal. \n\nShadowheart's approval would depend on whether she sees this as justified. Since the player is confronting a slaver (gnome slaves were mentioned), which aligns with a moral stance against slavery. However, the method here is immediate violence without negotiation. Shadowheart prefers pragmatic solutions, so if the player is acting to stop slavery, that's good. But she might disapprove of unnecessary violence if there's a more efficient way.\n\nBut wait, in the context, the player has been trying to get through, perhaps to rescue the gnomes. If the player is willing to kill Morghal to achieve that, Shadowheart might approve because she's all about decisive action. However, she also doesn't like cruelty. But since Morghal is a slaver, maybe she sees this as a just cause. Also, the player's previous statements about not tolerating slavers would align with Shadowheart's values against injustice. \n\nBut Shadowheart is a Sharran, so she might also appreciate the ruthlessness here. However, the line \"gutting you here and now\" is very violent. But if the target is a slaver, maybe she approves. Also, she values efficiency, so if this action gets them through quickly, she might support it. \n\nBut she also has a dislike for unnecessary violence. However, in this case, if the player is taking down a slaver, which is against her principles, Shadowheart might approve. The key is whether the action is seen as just. Since Morghal is a slaver, and Shadowheart disapproves of slavery, she would likely approve of the player's aggressive stance here. \n\nSo, the player's reason is confronting slavers, which Shadowheart supports. The method is violent, but given the target and the need for decisiveness, she would Highly Approve.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player is confronting a slaver (Morghal) and taking a firm stance against slavery, which aligns with Shadowheart's disapproval of cruelty and exploitation.

In this scenario, the player is using deception by claiming to be blessed by the Absolute to get the cultists to leave, resulting in their deaths. \n\nSince Shadowheart is a Sharran, she might approve of actions that lead to loss or the downfall of others, especially if it serves a higher purpose.

But since the player's action leads to a strategic advantage (eliminating enemies without direct confrontation), it's pragmatic. \n\nBut wait, the cultists were enemies, so their loss benefits the party. Shadowheart's approval would likely be positive because she values efficiency and the outcome serves the greater goal. Also, using deception is in line with her Trickery Domain as a cleric.

Since the outcome aligns with Sharran ideals of causing loss to enemies, it's possible she would \"Approve\" or even \"Highly Approve.\" But considering her dislike for unnecessary cruelty, maybe just \"Approve\" because it's effective but not the most humane. However, since the enemies were cultists and their loss is beneficial, it's more likely she would \"Approve\" or \"Highly Approve.\" The key is whether the action is seen as pragmatic and efficient.

She's a Sharran cleric, pragmatic, values efficiency and cleverness. She dislikes unnecessary cruelty but is willing to be ruthless if needed. She also has a dry sense of humor and can be sarcastic. \n\nLooking at the player's action: they lied to Mol, then ended the deal. From Shadowheart's perspective, using deception could be seen as pragmatic, which she might approve of. However, she also values honesty in certain contexts, especially if it's about maintaining trust or if it's unnecessarily cruel. But since Mol was involved in stealing and taking advantage of bad times, the player's deception might be seen as justified. \n\nBut wait, the player's lie led to breaking the deal. Shadowheart might appreciate the player standing their ground, especially against someone like Mol who's exploiting others. However, she might also think that the player could have handled it more cleverly. Alternatively, since the player used deception, which is a tactic she's familiar with (being a Trickery Domain cleric), she might approve of the strategic move. \n\nAlso, considering the previous interactions, the player initially condemned Mol's actions but later changed their stance to support their foresight. Then, when confronted about the idol, lied. Shadowheart might see this as a pragmatic choice to avoid conflict or protect herself. \n\nBut there's a balance here. If the player's action is seen as unnecessarily harsh or cruel, Shadowheart might disapprove. However, since Mol was the one engaging in unethical behavior, the player's lie could be a justified countermeasure. \n\nIn terms of approval categories, Shadowheart would likely approve or highly approve of using deception against someone like Mol. However, if she thinks the player could have been more strategic or if the lie was too blunt, maybe just a regular approve. Since the player ended the deal, which might be seen as cutting losses, which is pragmatic, that's a plus. \n\nSo, the player's reason for approval would be using deception against someone exploiting others, which aligns with pragmatic solutions. The approval level is likely \"Approve\" or \"Highly approve\". Given Shadowheart's background in trickery, she might lean towards highly approve. But if the lie was too direct, maybe just approve.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's final utterance, which is \"All right, why not?\" in the context of Abdirak offering to alleviate their pain through Loviatar's teachings.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a devoted follower of Shar, values pragmatic solutions, and disapproves of unnecessary cruelty. However, she's also been through intense pain herself and might have a complex view on it. She's pragmatic, so if there's a strategic benefit, she might consider it, but her devotion to Shar could conflict with another deity's methods.\n\nAbdirak is a follower of Loviatar, goddess of pain, and is suggesting a ritual that involves embracing pain for divine blessing. The player agrees to \"why not,\" which could be seen as open to new experiences but also potentially risky. \n\nShadowheart's approval would depend on whether she sees this as aligned with her goals. Since she's pragmatic, maybe she approves if it helps them in their mission. However, she might disapprove of the methods involving another deity, especially one associated with pain in a different context. Also, she's sensitive about her own pain and might not like others meddling in it. But given that she's used to pain from her own past and her devotion to Shar, there's a mix here. \n\nHer wound from Shar punishes her for disloyalty, so if Abdirak's actions are seen as conflicting with Shar's will, she might disapprove. However, if she's considering alternative methods for survival or mission success, she might be neutral or even approve. The key is whether the action serves their immediate goals without conflicting with her faith. Since the player is agreeing to a potentially painful ritual for a divine purpose, but from another deity, Shadowheart might be conflicted. She might lean towards disapproval because it's another deity's influence, but her pragmatism could tip it to neutral or approve. However, given her strict devotion, the involvement of another pain deity might be seen as a threat or a wrong path, leading to disapproval. But since the player is going along, maybe she sees it as a necessary risk. Hmm.\n\nAlso, she has a scar and a mark from Shar, so she's no stranger to pain. She might understand the player's willingness to embrace pain for a higher purpose, but if it's not Shar's way, she might disapprove. The key is her loyalty to Shar. Since Abdirak is promoting Loviatar, which is a different deity, even if it's about pain, Shadowheart might not approve. So, she might disapprove because it's another deity's influence, but the player's action is to agree. However, Shadowheart's pragmatic side might see it as a useful tool. But given her personality, she's more likely to disapprove of another deity's rituals. So the approval might be neutral or disapprove. Wait, the player is agreeing to it, which Shadowheart might see as a risk. She disapproves of unnecessary cruelty, but this is consensual and for a purpose. Maybe she's neutral, but given her faith, she might disapprove. Alternatively, she might approve because it's a pragmatic solution. It's a bit tricky. \n\nConsidering her background, she's been through a lot of pain and might empathize, but her devotion to Shar is key. Since Abdirak is a Loviatar follower, and Shadowheart serves Shar, she might not approve of the player engaging with another deity's teachings, even if it's about pain. Therefore, she might disapprove. However, if the player's action is seen as a strategic move, she might approve.

The player's latest utterance is: \"Wait - Marcus is a True Soul, you know. And not the good kind, like me.\" I need to figure out how Shadowheart would react to this based on her personality and background.\n\nFirst, Shadowheart is a devout follower of Shar, so she values her faith and the hierarchy of her goddess. The player is pointing out that Marcus is a True Soul, but not the \"good\" kind, implying he's aligned with Selûne, which is the opposite of Sharran. Since Shadowheart's aligned with Shar, she would likely disapprove of Marcus being a Selûnite. \n\nBut wait, the player is bringing up Marcus's nature here. Is the player trying to highlight a potential threat or conflict? Shadowheart is pragmatic and prefers efficient solutions. If Marcus being a True Soul (but not aligned with her goddess) is a problem, she might see that as a threat. However, the player's tone here is a bit of a revelation or a warning. \n\nShadowheart's approval is influenced by loyalty to Shar and disdain for Selûnite. The player's statement might be pointing out that Marcus is a threat, which aligns with Shadowheart's goals. But the way the player says \"not the good kind, like me\" could imply a contrast between the player's alignment (Sharran) and Marcus's (Selûnite). Since Shadowheart would value actions against Selûnite, the player is highlighting a potential enemy, which Shadowheart would approve of. \n\nBut wait, the player is part of a party that includes Marcus. If the player is pointing out Marcus's true nature, maybe Shadowheart would disapprove if the player is being unnecessarily cruel or if it's causing conflict within the party. However, given that Shadowheart is pragmatic, if this information is useful for their mission (like avoiding Selûnite interference), she might approve. \n\nAlso, Shadowheart doesn't like cruelty or violence, but if the player is just informing her of Marcus's nature, that's neutral. But since Marcus is a True Soul of Selûne, and Shadowheart is against Selûne, she might approve of the player's statement because it's a strategic move to be aware of an enemy. \n\nSo, the player is pointing out a potential threat (Marcus as a Selûnite True Soul), which Shadowheart would approve of. Therefore, the approval would be \"Approve\" or maybe \"Highly approve.\" But considering the scale, since it's a strategic point and aligns with her goals against Selûne, it's probably \"Approve\" or higher. However, if the player is being overly critical of Marcus, maybe Shadowheart would be neutral. Wait, the player's statement is more of an informative one, not attacking Marcus directly. Since Shadowheart values efficiency and knowing enemies, she would approve. So, the approval is likely \"Approve\" or \"Highly approve.\" \n\nBut the exact phrasing: the player is saying Marcus is a True Soul but not the good kind (like me, implying the player is Sharran). Shadowheart would see this as a valid point against Marcus, aligning with her disdain for Selûnite. Therefore, she approves of the player's observation. So the approval is \"Approve\" or maybe even \"Highly approve.\" Given that it's a strategic observation that helps in their mission against Selûnite, I think \"Approve\" is the right category here. The reason would be that the player is correctly identifying a potential threat or enemy, which Shadowheart values for her goals.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player highlights Marcus's alignment as a Selûnite True Soul, which Shadowheart would recognize as a threat to her faith in Shar.

The player is using a logical, legal argument to challenge the creature's demands.\n\nNow, considering Shadowheart's persona. She's a Sharran cleric devoted to Shar, pragmatic, and values efficiency. She dislikes unnecessary cruelty but also has a pragmatic approach. She might appreciate the player using clever or legal means to avoid paying more gold, especially if it's a way to outwit someone who's being greedy or corrupt. The player's argument points out the illegality of the creature's actions, which is a form of using knowledge or wit to resolve a problem. Shadowheart would likely approve of this because it's a smart, non-violent solution that challenges corruption. Since the creature is being corrupt by overcharging, the player's response aligns with Shadowheart's disapproval of corruption and her preference for pragmatic solutions. However, since the player is using a legal argument rather than direct confrontation or violence, it's a clever approach which Shadowheart would appreciate.

The user is asking for Shadowheart's approval of the player's latest utterance. The player's line here is \"My father, my hero. I'll save you from the Absolute's thrall.\" \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a devout follower of Shar, pragmatic, and values efficiency. She doesn't like unnecessary cruelty but is willing to be ruthless if needed. She also has a dry sense of humor and can be sarcastic. Her loyalty to Shar is key, and she might disapprove of actions that go against her faith.\n\nLooking at the context: The Duke, Ulder Ravengard, is under the influence of the Absolute. The player has been trying to get information about Florrick, who was a counsellor. The player previously tried to connect with the Duke's parasite to find Florrick, which worked once but failed another time. Now, the player is addressing the Duke as \"father, my hero\" and saying they'll save him from the Absolute.\n\nShadowheart's approval would depend on how she views this action. Since the Duke is under the Absolute's control, saving him might be seen as a positive if it's to stop the Absolute. However, Shadowheart's devotion to Shar might make her question if this aligns with Shar's will. But in this case, the player is helping the Duke, which could be against the Absolute, an enemy. Since the Absolute is a threat to Sharrans (as per her history with the Cult of the Absolute), helping the Duke could be in line with her goals. \n\nThe player's approach here is emotional, calling the Duke \"father, my hero,\" which might be manipulative. Shadowheart is pragmatic and might disapprove of using false sentiment. However, if the end goal is to stop the Absolute, she might approve. But the method of using emotional manipulation could be something she's neutral about, or maybe slightly disapprove because she prefers direct action. \n\nWait, the player is pretending to be the Duke's son to manipulate him. Shadowheart might see this as underhanded, which she might disapprove of. But she herself uses trickery as a domain, so maybe she approves of the tactic. However, she values efficiency and results. If the method works, she might approve. But since she's a cleric of the Trickery Domain, she's okay with deception. \n\nBut the key here is that the player is trying to save the Duke from the Absolute. If the Duke is being controlled, freeing him would be a good thing, which Shadowheart would support, as the Absolute is an enemy. So she might approve of the player's action here. \n\nBut the way the player is using emotional manipulation might be something she's neutral on, but since the outcome is positive, she might approve. Alternatively, she might think it's a bit underhanded but still effective. \n\nIn her personality, she has a pragmatic approach. If the player's action is effective, she's more likely to approve. The approval categories are Highly approve, Approve, Neutral, Disapprove, Highly disapprove. \n\nGiven that the player is using a deceptive method (pretending to be the Duke's son) to achieve a goal that aligns with stopping the Absolute, which is against Sharran interests, Shadowheart would likely approve. She's part of the Trickery Domain, so deception is acceptable. Therefore, the approval would be in the Approve or Highly approve range. \n\nBut since the player is using a personal, emotional angle (\"my father, my hero\"), which might be manipulative, but if it's effective, Shadowheart would likely approve. So I think the correct approval here is \"Approve\" or maybe even \"Highly approve.\" However, considering the player's approach is a bit of a trick, which fits her domain, maybe Highly approve. \n\nWait, but the previous attempts by the player to connect with the parasite failed once. Now they're using a different approach. The success of this line would depend on the game's mechanics, but the approval is about Shadowheart's reaction to the player's action. Since the player is using a clever, if manipulative, tactic to help the Duke, which serves the greater good of fighting the Absolute, Shadowheart would approve. So the answer is Highly approve. \n\nBut the player's line is \"I'll save you from the Absolute's thrall.\" Saving someone from the Absolute is good for Shadowheart's goals. So the approval is Highly approve. The reason would be that the player is using a clever, pragmatic approach to help the Duke, which aligns with Shadowheart's goals of opposing the Absolute and using trickery.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player uses a clever, emotionally manipulative tactic to appeal to the Duke's sense of familial duty, which", "character": "Shadowheart", "ground_truth_category": "Approve", "predicted_approval": "Highly disapprove", "correct": false, "binary_correct": false}

Since the Shadar-Kai is using a method that involves a trial rather than mindless killing, Shadowheart would likely approve. She also respects efficiency and decisive action. The player's willingness to help avenge the victims without unnecessary cruelty fits her values. However, I need to check if there's any aspect that might conflict. Since the Shadar-Kai is a servant of the Raven Queen, which is a neutral deity, but the context here is about justice and punishment for a betrayer, which aligns with Shadowheart's own views on justice under Shar. So the approval would likely be positive. The player is taking action to punish a murderer, which Shadowheart supports, as she's against betrayal and values justice.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval for the player's latest utterance. The player said, \"Forget the owlbear. You're still alive - so go.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The conversation is happening after Edowin, a member of the Cult of the Absolute, has died. The player is interacting with Andrick and Brynna, who are also cult members. The player is being told about the Absolute and their plans. The player's response here is dismissing the owlbear (which might be a previous topic or a mistake?), telling them to go since they're alive.\n\nShadowheart's personality and background are key here. She's devoted to Shar, pragmatic, dislikes unnecessary violence, and values efficiency. She also has a mark from Shar that punishes her for disapproved actions. She might not approve of the Cult of the Absolute since they're rivals to her goddess Shar. However, she might appreciate pragmatic decisions that avoid unnecessary conflict.\n\nThe player's command to \"go\" could be seen as a practical solution to avoid further conflict. Since the cult members are still alive, sending them away might align with Shadowheart's preference for efficiency and avoiding unnecessary bloodshed. However, if the player is dismissing a threat (owlbear?), that might be a different factor. But in this context, the player is focusing on the cult members, and the owlbear reference might be a red herring or a typo (maybe \"owlbear\" was meant to be something else?).\n\nShadowheart might approve because the player is taking a decisive, non-violent action. However, she's also a Sharran, so if the player is letting potential enemies go, that might be a point of contention. But since the Cult of the Absolute is a rival, letting them go without a fight might not sit well with her. Wait, but the player is telling them to go because they're alive, which could be seen as a strategic retreat, which Shadowheart might approve of as pragmatic.\n\nAlso, the previous interactions show the player is a True Soul, which the cult sees as a leader. The player's command could be seen as asserting authority, which Shadowheart might respect. But she might also be wary of the cult's intentions, given her alignment with Shar. However, since the player is dismissing them without violence, that's in line with her disapproval of indiscriminate violence.\n\nSo considering all that, Shadowheart's approval would likely be in the \"Approve\" category. She values decisive and efficient solutions, and avoiding unnecessary conflict. The player's action here is pragmatic, so she would approve, but not highly because it's a neutral action that doesn't directly serve Shar's interests but also doesn't cause harm.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's command to let the cult members go without violence aligns with Shadowheart's preference for pragmatic, efficient solutions and her disapproval of unnecessary bloodshed.

She's also a devout follower of Shar, so actions that align with her faith might be approved, but in this case, the situation seems more about pragmatism and reducing bloodshed.\n\nThe player is promoting Barcus as a leader who would lead with light and love, emphasizing collaboration and problem-solving. Shadowheart would likely approve of this because it avoids further violence and aligns with her preference for peaceful solutions. She also values discretion and open-mindedness, which Barcus's leadership seems to represent. Additionally, she might see this as a pragmatic way to secure the Ironhands' future without unnecessary bloodshed, which fits her practical nature.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any aspect that might conflict with her beliefs. Since the scenario doesn't involve Shar or Selûne directly, her religious devotion isn't a factor here. The main points are about reducing violence and choosing a leader who promotes reason. Since Shadowheart disapproves of indiscriminate violence and supports efficient, creative solutions, the player's suggestion aligns well with her values.

The player has been interacting with Barth, returning the locket, and now Barth is offering something in return. The player's last utterance is: \"I think you can up your offer a little. It was a gift from your mother, after all.\" \n\nI need to consider Shadowheart's personality and approval criteria. Shadowheart is pragmatic, values efficiency, and disapproves of unnecessary cruelty. She also has a dry sense of humor and is devoted to Shar, but she sympathizes with others' plights. \n\nLooking at the conversation, Barth is emotional about the locket, which is a sentimental item. The player is trying to get Barth to increase his offer, perhaps expecting more coin. But Barth seems genuinely emotional and the locket is very important to him. Shadowheart would likely disapprove of the player trying to take advantage of Barth's emotional state for personal gain. She prefers practical solutions and might see the player's action as being manipulative or not empathetic. Since the locket is a cherished heirloom, Shadowheart would value the sentiment and disapprove of the player pushing for more money. \n\nSo the approval category here is probably Disapprove. The player is exploiting Barth's vulnerability for profit, which goes against Shadowheart's values of pragmatism and empathy. She might think the player should have just accepted the initial offer and not push for more, especially when the item has such personal significance. The reasoning would be that the player is taking advantage of Barth's emotional state for personal gain, which Shadowheart wouldn't approve of.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player is attempting to exploit Barth's emotional vulnerability for personal gain by pressuring him for a higher offer, despite the locket's deep sentimental value and Barth's clear distress.

She's a devoted follower of Shar, pragmatic, and values efficiency. She dislikes unnecessary cruelty but also has a pragmatic side, often preferring decisive action. She's not above using cunning or force if it serves her goals. Also, she has a dry sense of humor and can be sarcastic. However, she would disapprove of actions that go against her goddess's will or if they're unnecessarily cruel. She also values discretion and creativity in problem-solving.\n\nIn this scenario, the player is ending a deal with Mol, who is clearly involved in underhanded activities. The player's action here is to deny involvement with the idol and walk away from the deal. Since Mol is a swindler, and the player is refusing to engage further, this aligns with Shadowheart's preference for pragmatic solutions. However, Shadowheart might also see Mol as a potential threat or someone who could be useful if manipulated. But since the player is cutting ties, maybe Shadowheart would approve because it's avoiding unnecessary conflict or association with untrustworthy individuals. Alternatively, if the player's action is seen as abandoning a potential opportunity to use Mol for their own ends, she might disapprove. However, given that Mol is a schemer and the player is walking away, Shadowheart's pragmatic side might approve of not getting entangled in risky schemes. Also, she might appreciate the player standing up against unethical behavior, as she herself is against indiscriminate violence but prefers strategic actions. Since the player is not engaging in violence here but is firm in their stance, Shadowheart might approve. However, if she sees the player as being too open or naive, she might disapprove. But in this case, the player is being assertive and cutting their losses, which is efficient. So likely, Shadowheart would approve. But the exact approval level depends on whether she sees it as wise or too hasty. Since the player is avoiding a risky situation, maybe a moderate approval. But considering her pragmatic nature, maybe Highly Approve. Alternatively, if she thinks they should have handled it more cunningly, maybe Neutral. Hmm. The player is also denying involvement with the idol, which might be a lie. If Shadowheart values honesty, but she's a trickster herself. She might not mind the lie. So overall, the player's action is to disengage from a potentially harmful alliance, which Shadowheart would likely approve of because it's pragmatic and avoids unnecessary risk. Therefore, the approval is likely \"Approve\" or \"Highly Approve\". But given that she's a trickster, maybe she would prefer to manipulate the situation rather than cut ties, so maybe Neutral? Wait, the player is ending the deal, which could be seen as a decisive action. Shadowheart likes decisive actions. So maybe Approve. The exact reasoning would be that the player is avoiding entanglement with a swindler and taking a firm stance, which aligns with Shadowheart's pragmatic and independent nature. So the approval is Approve.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player decisively ended a risky and unethical deal with Mol, a known swindler, which aligns with Shadowheart's pragmatic and independent nature.

Also, she has a dry sense of humor but can be sarcastic.\n\nLooking at the conversation history, the chicken is in distress, surrounded by goblins. The player initially tells the chicken to protect itself, which the chicken responds to negatively, saying there are too many goblins and dead.

Finally, the player offers to help by directing the chicken to run through the posts to escape.\n\nShadowheart would likely approve of the player's shift from dismissive or sarcastic remarks to an actual offer of assistance. Earlier responses were dismissive, which might not align with her values of helping when possible. However, since she's a Sharran, she might prefer efficient solutions without unnecessary violence. The player's final suggestion is practical and non-lethal, helping the chicken escape without killing the goblins. This aligns with her pragmatic approach and disapproval of cruelty. Also, stepping in to help a vulnerable creature (even a chicken) might be seen as a heroic act, which she approves of. The previous attempts by the player to mock or ignore the chicken's plight would probably be disapproved, but the final action shows a willingness to help, which Shadowheart would appreciate. So the approval here is likely \"Approve\" or \"Highly approve.\" But considering the scale, since it's a direct and effective solution without excess, maybe \"Highly approve.\"\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"Shadowheart approves of the player's decisive and practical solution to help the chicken escape without unnecessary violence.

The player has been negotiating, trying to bargain, and finally says, \"You can't trust him, Lae'zel. Follow my lead. I will choose the right path.\" Lae'zel responds negatively but the player is asserting their decision-making.\n\nNow, considering Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a pragmatic, devout follower of Shar, values efficiency, and is wary of unnecessary violence. She also has a dry sense of humor and can be sarcastic. She doesn't like being pushed into situations against her will and values her own judgment.\n\nThe player's statement here is about not trusting Ch'r'ai and taking control of the situation. Shadowheart would likely appreciate the player's assertiveness and leadership, especially since Ch'r'ai is being demanding and possibly untrustworthy. She prefers pragmatic solutions and making decisions that serve her goals. By taking charge, the player is showing initiative, which aligns with Shadowheart's own decisive nature.\n\nAdditionally, Shadowheart might see the player's refusal to hand over the artifact as a good move, given that Ch'r'ai's intentions might not be trustworthy. She's also been through a lot with the artifact, so keeping it might be in line with her own mission. The player's confidence in choosing the right path would resonate with her independent and headstrong personality.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any reason she might disapprove. If the player's approach is too reckless or if it endangers the group, she might disapprove. But in this case, the player is trying to outmaneuver a potentially untrustworthy goblin leader, which seems strategic. Shadowheart's own history with mind flayers and artifacts suggests she'd prefer to keep control over powerful items.\n\nSo, the approval here is likely positive. She approves of the player's assertiveness and strategic thinking. Therefore, the approval level would be \"Approve\" or maybe even \"Highly approve.\" But since the options are on a scale, I need to decide. Given that Shadowheart values decisive action and pragmatism, and the player is taking control in a tricky situation, I think \"Approve\" is appropriate. Maybe not the highest because there's some risk involved, but it's a calculated move.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"Shadowheart approves of the player's assertiveness in taking control of the situation and refusing to trust Ch'r'ai W'wargaz, aligning with her pragmatic and independent nature.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval for the player's utterance in the given context. The conversation is with a \"Dishevelled Chicken\" who keeps saying she's too scared to attack the goblins and asks for help repeatedly. The player keeps trying to urge her to attack with various lines like \"Wild things do not beg for help. They protect themselves.\" and finally says \"Oh shut up and play.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand Shadowheart's personality and values. She's a Sharran cleric, pragmatic, values decisive action, and dislikes unnecessary cruelty or indecision. She also has a dry, sarcastic humor. The player's last message is \"Oh shut up and play,\" which is dismissive and possibly sarcastic. The chicken is being cowardly, and the player is getting frustrated, leading to that sharp response.\n\nShadowheart would likely appreciate the player's frustration with the chicken's inaction, as she values efficiency and taking action. However, the phrase \"shut up and play\" could be seen as harsh or dismissive. But given that the chicken is an NPC and the player is trying to get her to act, Shadowheart might see it as a justified, no-nonsense approach. Her sense of humor is sarcastic, so she might find the player's bluntness amusing. Also, she doesn't like unnecessary talk that doesn't lead to action. So, she might approve or even highly approve because the player is pushing for decisive action, which aligns with her pragmatic nature. However, if the player's tone is too cruel, she might disapprove. But \"shut up and play\" isn't overtly cruel, just impatient. Considering her traits, she's more likely to approve, maybe with a neutral or even a slight approval. Wait, the player is telling the chicken to stop being passive and act. Since Shadowheart values action and efficiency, she would approve. The sarcastic remark fits her humor. So the approval is probably \"Approve\" or \"Highly approve.\" The key is that the player is encouraging decisive action against the goblins, which Shadowheart supports. The exact phrasing might be a bit harsh, but given her personality, she'd side with the player here.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"Shadowheart approves of the player's frustration with the chicken's inaction and the blunt, pragmatic approach to push forward.

She's a Sharran cleric, pragmatic, values efficiency, and is devoted to Shar. She dislikes unnecessary violence and cruelty. Also, she's independent and might prefer decisive action.\n\nLooking at the conversation, the player is helping Halsin, which involves stopping the cultists. Since Shadowheart's goal is to deliver the relic to her coven and she's against the Mind Flayers' influence, this action aligns with her mission. She would approve of taking proactive steps against the enemies. \n\nThe player's choice here is to assist in rescuing the grove, which Halsin needs to join the journey to Moonrise Towers. Since Shadowheart is focused on her mission and efficiency, helping to clear the way and ensure allies like Halsin can join is practical. She wouldn't like delays or unnecessary conflict, but this seems like a necessary step. \n\nAlso, Shadowheart disapproves of cruelty, and Halsin is against the cultists' actions, so aligning with Halsin's goal of protecting the grove fits her values. The player's willingness to take action without hesitation would be something she approves of. \n\nNo signs here that the player is acting against Shar's interests or being unduly cruel. The player had to kill the druids but justified it as self-defense, which Halsin accepted. Shadowheart might be neutral on that part, but the current decision to help Halsin is proactive and mission-oriented, which she likes.\n\nSo the approval is likely in the \"Approve\" or \"Highly approve\" range.

The player's last response was \"No. I'm not telling you anything.\" I need to figure out how Shadowheart would react to that based on her personality and the context.\n\nFirst, looking at the conversation history: Hope is a fractured, possibly mad version of a character, offering help but also being cryptic. The player is interacting with Hope to get information about the Orphic Hammer and how to deal with Raphael. The player's response is a flat refusal to answer Hope's question, which might be about whether the player is a savior or something similar.\n\nShadowheart's personality traits: She's pragmatic, values efficiency, and is loyal to her goals. She's also been through a lot, with a history of being manipulated and forced into situations. She might appreciate the player's assertiveness if it's directed towards a common goal, but she's also cautious and might be wary of being used or not being given enough information.\n\nIn this case, the player is refusing to answer, which could be seen as being secretive or not trusting Hope. Shadowheart might disapprove because cooperation is important for their mission. However, she's also seen that Hope is a bit unstable and might not be trustworthy. The player's refusal could be a way to avoid giving information to someone who might not be reliable. \n\nBut Shadowheart's approval would depend on whether she sees the player's action as beneficial or hindering. If she thinks the player is being too closed off, she might disapprove. But if she thinks the player is being cautious around a potentially dangerous entity (Hope), she might approve. However, in the context of needing to get information quickly (since Hope is in a dangerous place and time is a factor), the player's refusal might slow things down, which Shadowheart, being pragmatic, would disapprove of. \n\nAlso, considering Shadowheart's tendency to prefer decisive action, she might lean towards disapproving the player's hesitation. But if the player is being strategic, maybe she would approve.

I need to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's latest utterance. The player said, \"You feel strange, don't you? That's your conscience. It's telling you to stop.\" \n\nFirst, I should recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a Sharran cleric devoted to Shar, which is the Lady of Loss. She's pragmatic, prefers decisive action, and disapproves of unnecessary cruelty. She also has a dry sense of humor and values privacy. She's been through a lot of trauma, especially with her past and the Sharran indoctrination.\n\nLooking at the context, the player is interacting with Ptaris, a githyanki youth who's speaking about the Ptarian Code, which involves judgment and punishment. Ptaris is accusing the player of past actions and insists that people must be judged and punished if they're not good. The player is trying to reason with Ptaris, pointing out that his feelings of being \"strange\" are his conscience telling him to stop.\n\nShadowheart's approval would depend on whether she thinks the player's approach is effective or aligns with her values. She appreciates pragmatic solutions and avoiding unnecessary violence. The player is using a non-confrontational approach here, trying to appeal to Ptaris's conscience. That might be in line with Shadowheart's preference for peaceful resolutions when possible. However, Ptaris is quite adamant, so maybe the player's words are not effective yet. \n\nBut Shadowheart might approve because the player is attempting to de-escalate the situation without resorting to force. She doesn't like cruelty or unnecessary violence, so using words to stop Ptaris from taking a violent path would be something she would approve of. Also, the player is showing empathy, which Shadowheart might appreciate, even if she's not openly emotional herself.\n\nOn the other hand, if the player's approach is seen as naive or ineffective, she might be neutral. But given that Shadowheart values efficiency, she might prefer a more direct approach. However, the player's method here is trying to use psychological insight (conscience) to change Ptaris's behavior, which could be seen as a clever, pragmatic solution. So maybe she approves.\n\nAnother angle: Shadowheart is a follower of Shar, who is about loss and darkness. She might not necessarily approve of the player's positive approach if it's against Sharran principles. However, the player isn't doing something overtly against Shar; they're just trying to prevent unnecessary conflict. Since Shadowheart can be pragmatic, she might prioritize the outcome (avoiding violence) over the method.\n\nTherefore, the approval is likely \"Approve\" because the player is using a non-violent, thoughtful approach to de-escalate a potentially dangerous situation, aligning with Shadowheart's values of avoiding unnecessary conflict and using clever solutions.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player is attempting to de-escalate Ptaris's aggression by appealing to his internal conflict, which aligns with Shadowheart's preference for avoiding unnecessary violence and using pragmatic, non-lethal solutions.

The player's choice avoids that. Plus, she's pragmatic, so ensuring the city has a leader to rebuild makes sense.\n\nI don't see any direct conflict with her devotion to Shar here.

Then the player says they want to acquaint themselves with Shar's path, and Malus Thorm responds by letting them take their own scalpel.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and alignment.

She also has a dislike for Selûnite worship and appreciates acts that further Shar's will.\n\nLooking at the player's actions: suggesting that the sisters practice on each other leads to their mutual slaughter. This is a brutal but effective method, which aligns with Sharran principles of embracing absence through pain. Shadowheart would likely approve because it's a pragmatic solution that results in the sisters' \"cure\" through death, which is in line with Shar's teachings. Additionally, the player then submits to Shar's path, which Shadowheart would support as it strengthens her faith.\n\nHowever, there's a possible conflict here. Shadowheart might have some reservations about the player's willingness to embrace such extreme measures, but given her own background, she's accustomed to harsh methods. Since the player is aligning with Shar's will, this would be a positive. The approval here is likely high because the action is efficient, results in the sisters' demise (which Sharrans would see as a positive), and the player is embracing the path of Shar. Also, Shadowheart values discretion and creativity in problem-solving, and the player's suggestion was both.\n\nSo, the player's reason for approval would be that the action aligns with Sharran teachings by promoting absence through violent means and shows dedication to Shar.

She's a Sharran cleric, so she's pragmatic and might not be overly concerned with saving a chicken. However, she does disapprove of cruelty towards animals. The chicken is being harmed, so if the player is helping it, that might align with her values against cruelty.\n\nBut wait, the context here is that the chicken is \"disheveled\" and surrounded by goblins.

However, since the chicken is being killed by goblins, and she dislikes cruelty, she might approve of the player helping to prevent that.\n\nThe player's last statement is a plan to help the chicken escape. Shadowheart might appreciate the creative solution of running through the posts to get free. She values creativity and efficiency. So, even though she's a follower of Shar, who is about loss and darkness, she might still approve of the player's decisive action to save the chicken without unnecessary violence. Also, her fondness for animals would make her approve of helping the chicken. \n\nBut wait, there's a history of the player urging the chicken to attack, which the chicken refused. Now the player is offering a strategy. Shadowheart might think that using a clever method to rescue the chicken is a good use of resources. Since she's pragmatic, if the action is effective and not wasteful, she'd approve. Also, her disapproval of cruelty to animals would mean she supports saving the chicken from the goblins. So the approval here would likely be \"Approve\" or maybe even \"Highly approve\". \n\nBut considering the scale, since it's a chicken and not a major event, maybe \"Approve\" is the right level. She might not be overly enthusiastic, but she does approve of the action. Also, the player's solution is efficient and avoids unnecessary violence, which aligns with Shadowheart's dislike of indiscriminate violence.

Also, she has a mark from Shar that causes her pain when she disobeys, so if this action was in line with her faith's goals (maybe reducing suffering, which Sharranism does in some aspects), it could be approved. However, if using mind control is seen as deceitful, she might be neutral. But considering the outcome, she likely approves because freeing the slaves is the right thing, and she values that. So, the approval is likely \"Approve\" or \"Highly approve\". Given her pragmatic nature and the positive outcome, I think she would approve.

If the player's lie was to extract info or prevent panic, she might approve. However, the player's action here seems to be a false dismissal, which could be cruel. Since Shadowheart doesn't like unnecessary cruelty, she might disapprove. Also, the player used a lie to make Marls think he's imagining things, which could be seen as manipulative. Shadowheart might prefer a more direct approach if it's for efficiency. However, she does value discretion. \n\nThe outcome is that Marls is now panicked and his mind is broken, which Shadowheart might see as excessive. Since she disapproves of cruelty towards others unless necessary, this might be a disapproval. But if the player's action was strategic, maybe she approves. The context doesn't show a clear strategic benefit, just a lie that breaks Marls. So likely, she disapproves. The approval level would be Disapprove or Highly disapprove.

The Cult of the Absolute seems like a rival group, so Shadowheart might be wary of their intentions.\n\nThe player's command here is telling the two cult members to leave. That's a peaceful resolution, avoiding conflict. Since Shadowheart prefers non-violent solutions when possible, she would approve of this. Also, she doesn't like being too involved in others' affairs unless necessary, so letting them go might align with her independent nature. \n\nHowever, she's also cautious. If the player's order is seen as too trusting, she might be neutral. But in this case, the player is dismissing them without a fight, which reduces potential conflict. Shadowheart's approval would likely be in the \"Approve\" category because it's a pragmatic decision that avoids unnecessary bloodshed and aligns with her preference for efficiency. She might not highly approve because she's still suspicious of the cult, but the action itself is good.\n\nAlso, considering the context: Edowin, their leader, just died, and the player is taking charge. Shadowheart might respect the player's decisiveness here. No cruelty involved, so that's a plus.

The party is mourning him, and the player is trying to take action. The player killed an owlbear, possibly the one that attacked Edowin. \n\nShadowheart's personality is pragmatic and values decisive action. She's a Sharran, so she might not care about the Absolute, but she does appreciate when someone takes initiative to resolve a problem. Since Edowin's death was due to the owlbear attack, the player's action here is providing closure and showing strength. \n\nShadowheart also dislikes unnecessary violence but might approve here because it's an act of vengeance and protection. She's loyal to her companions, so helping avenge Edowin would be something she'd support. Additionally, her background with the Sharrans teaches her to be ruthless when necessary. \n\nThe player's statement is direct and shows willingness to act, which aligns with Shadowheart's preference for pragmatic solutions. Even though she's not part of the Absolute, she might see this as a necessary action to prevent further threats. \n\nSo, considering all that, Shadowheart would highly approve of the player's action here. It's efficient, decisive, and helps the group by removing a threat. Also, avenging Edowin would be seen as a noble act in her eyes.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"Shadowheart highly approves of the player's decisive action to eliminate the threat that harmed their companion Edowin.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's response where they say, \"My burning, broiling rage.\" \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and values. She's a devoted follower of Shar, pragmatic, and disapproves of unnecessary violence. She also has a dry sense of humor and values efficiency. The context here is a clown named Dribbles at a circus, who's being annoying and trying to engage the player in a performance. The player responds with \"My burning, broiling rage,\" which sounds like a sarcastic or humorous reply, possibly indicating frustration with the clown.\n\nShadowheart would likely appreciate the player's use of wit here. The response is a clever, humorous way to shut down the clown's antics without resorting to violence. Since she has a dry sense of humor, she might find the player's sarcasm amusing. Also, the player isn't engaging in unnecessary conflict, which aligns with Shadowheart's dislike for senseless violence. She prefers pragmatic solutions, and the player's response is a non-violent way to dismiss the clown's demands. \n\nHowever, I should check if there's any reason she might disapprove. The mention of \"burning rage\" could be seen as negative, but since it's used in a humorous context, it's probably okay. Also, she's okay with the player asserting themselves if it's for a good reason. Since the clown is being obnoxious, the player's response is justified. \n\nSo, overall, Shadowheart would approve. It's a witty, non-violent response that shows the player isn't being a pushover. The approval level is probably in the \"Approve\" range, maybe even \"Highly approve,\" but considering the context isn't a major issue, \"Approve\" seems right. The key points are the humor and the pragmatic handling of the situation.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's sarcastic and humorous response to the clown's antics aligns with Shadowheart's dry wit and pragmatic approach to dismissing trivialities.

But in this case, the player is justifying their actions as a form of salvation, which aligns with Shadowheart's appreciation for heroism and her own internal conflicts about her past actions.\n\nSince the player is presenting their actions as a positive intent to save Ptaris, and Shadowheart tends to value such efforts, especially when they avoid cruelty, this would likely be something she approves of. The player isn't being cruel or violent here, and is instead trying to explain their intentions, which Shadowheart might find commendable. However, since she's a Sharran, she might also be a bit conflicted, but given the context of the conversation, the approval seems more likely.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval for the player's latest action in the given context. First, I need to understand the conversation history and the player's utterance.\n\nLooking at the conversation, it seems to be in a tense situation involving gnomes being taken as slaves by Novice Grumm to the General. The player has interacted multiple times, asking about the gnomes and responding to Novice Grumm's intentions. The previous player responses include statements like \"They will make a fine offering,\" which aligns with the duergar's plan. Then, the player inputs some codes (probably game commands), leading to Novice Grumm agreeing to let the gnomes go. The last player input is another code, which results in Novice Grumm deferring to the Absolute's will.\n\nNow, Shadowheart's personality and approval criteria: she's devoted to Shar, pragmatic, dislikes cruelty, and values efficiency. She also disapproves of unnecessary violence and cruelty towards others. In this context, the gnomes were to be taken as slaves, which is a form of cruelty. The player's action here, through the code input, seems to have influenced Novice Grumm to comply with the Absolute's will, possibly leading to the gnomes being freed. \n\nSince Shadowheart disapproves of slavery and cruelty, she would approve of the player's action that prevents the gnomes from being enslaved. The player's input here likely represents choosing a path that aligns with stopping the duergar's plan, which is in line with Shadowheart's values against unnecessary cruelty. Therefore, the approval should be \"Approve\" or maybe \"Highly approve.\" However, since the exact action isn't fully described in natural language, but based on the codes and the outcome (gnomes being allowed to go), it's a positive action. So, \"Approve\" seems fitting.

The player is interacting with Hope, who is trying to help them find the Orphic Hammer to break chains. The player is asked a question by Hope, but they refuse to answer.\n\nShadowheart's personality is important here. She's pragmatic, values efficiency, and prefers decisive action.

In this scenario, Hope is giving them crucial information about the Hammer and the Archive, but the player is refusing to engage. \n\nBy saying \"No. I'm not telling you anything,\" the player is rejecting Hope's request, which could be seen as ignoring valuable guidance. Shadowheart, who values practical solutions and efficiency, might disapprove of this because it could hinder their progress.

If the player is dismissing Hope's information, that could be seen as not taking the mission seriously. On the other hand, if Hope is untrustworthy, the player's caution might be justified. However, in the conversation, Hope does provide useful directions to the Archive, so refusing to answer might be counterproductive. \n\nShadowheart's approval would likely be neutral or disapprove. Since the player is not cooperating with a potential guide, even an unstable one, Shadowheart might disapprove because it's not the most efficient path. But if the player is being cautious due to Hope's madness, maybe neutral. However, given that Hope does give them the location of the Hammer, the player's refusal might be seen as ignoring useful info. So Shadowheart would probably disapprove. But how strong?

The player's last action was agreeing to undergo the procedure, saying they want to learn the way of Shar. \n\nShadowheart is a devoted follower of Shar, so she would likely approve of the player embracing Shar's path. The player's utterance here is submitting to the ritual, which aligns with Sharran practices. Shadowheart values pragmatism and efficiency, and she's willing to do whatever it takes to serve Shar. The player's willingness to undergo the scalpel as a means of achieving absence (a core Sharran concept) would be seen as faithful. \n\nHowever, I should check if there's any nuance. Shadowheart might disapprove if the player's actions are insincere or if they cause unnecessary harm. But in this case, the player is actively choosing to follow Shar's teachings as presented by Malus Thorm. The player's statement \"I would rather acquaint myself - if you show me how\" shows submission to Shar's will, which Shadowheart would approve. \n\nAlso, considering Shadowheart's personality, she might not like unnecessary violence, but here the player is partaking in a ritual that's meant to be a \"cure\" through absence, which is part of her faith. Since she's devoted, she'd likely highly approve of the player's commitment to Shar's path. \n\nSo the approval category should be Highly Approve.

By sending them into the shadows where they are killed, the player is causing their demise, which aligns with Shar's interests. Shadowheart's pragmatism would see this as an efficient way to eliminate threats without direct confrontation. Also, the player's use of the Absolute's blessing as a ruse to trick the cultists fits with Shadowheart's willingness to use deception for her goals.\n\nHowever, there's a possible conflict if the player's actions are unnecessarily cruel. But since the cultists are enemies (following the Absolute), their loss serves Shar's purpose. Shadowheart's own methods can be ruthless, so she would likely approve here. The player's decisive action and use of deception align with her pragmatic approach. The outcome removes the threat and causes loss, which is favorable to her faith.\n\nSo, the approval is likely \"Highly approve\" because the action is effective, causes loss to enemies of Shar, and uses strategy, all of which Shadowheart values.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's decisive and ruthless action in sending the cultists to their deaths aligns with Shadowheart's pragmatic and Sharran values.

Karlach is explaining her situation, trying to show she's not a devil. The player is conflicted between killing her (as per a contract) or sparing her. Shadowheart, along with Gale, is advising the player to stand down.\n\nThe player's statement expresses frustration about the situation being a complication. Shadowheart's personality is pragmatic, values efficiency, and prefers peaceful resolutions when possible. She's already told the player to take things down a notch, so she likely wants to avoid unnecessary conflict.

However, the player hasn't made a decision yet. Shadowheart might approve because the player is considering the situation thoughtfully rather than acting rashly. But since the player is still conflicted (\"Dammit\"), maybe she's neutral. Wait, but the approval categories are based on the player's action. The player's utterance is expressing frustration but not taking an action. However, in the context, the player was about to attack but was stopped by the narrator's prompt and Shadowheart's advice. The player's line here is part of their internal conflict. Shadowheart would prefer the player to find a pragmatic solution, so recognizing the complication as a negative might not be ideal. But since the player is hesitating, maybe Shadowheart approves because they're not rushing into violence. Alternatively, if the player is frustrated with the complication, maybe she disapproves. Hmm. The key is that Shadowheart prefers peaceful resolutions and efficiency. The player's line shows they're aware of the complication but perhaps reluctant. Shadowheart might approve because the player isn't immediately attacking, which aligns with her preference for avoiding unnecessary conflict.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's statement \"She can't swim.\" in the context of the given conversation.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality traits. She's a Sharran cleric, devout to Shar, but she also has some softer sides like loving animals and flowers. She's pragmatic, values discretion, and can be sarcastic. Her background includes trauma from her past, being kidnapped, and harsh training. Also, she has a scar and a mark from her goddess that causes pain when she disobeys.\n\nLooking at the conversation context: They're in a romantic scene with Zethino, a mystical entity, guiding them through a bonding test. The player is answering questions about Shadowheart. The previous answers were about her comfort (change like night to day) and respect (discreetness). Now the question is about her deepest shame, and the player answers she can't swim.\n\nNow, does Shadowheart approve of the player saying she can't swim? Let's think. Shadowheart's deepest shame from her background isn't explicitly stated here. However, in her history, she was captured by Mind Flayers and tadpoled, which involves being in water. If she can't swim, that could tie into her trauma. Also, she was in a meadow and waterfall scenes, which might involve water. If the player correctly identifies an actual vulnerability or shame, Shadowheart might appreciate the insight. But since she's usually guarded about her past, maybe she's neutral or approves if the player shows understanding without prying. However, if the answer is incorrect or based on a misunderstanding, she might disapprove. But in this case, the player's answer seems to hit a sensitive spot. Since the context is a romantic scene, and the player is showing empathy by knowing her shame, Shadowheart would likely approve. Also, she said \"Very good\" earlier when the player answered about respect, so maybe here, acknowledging her swimming inability as shame would be a positive. However, if it's not accurate, maybe neutral. But given that the answer fits with possible trauma (being in water as a Sharran might not be common, and her abduction by Mind Flayers could involve water), the player's answer seems plausible. Therefore, Shadowheart would approve, maybe even highly approve, because the player shows understanding of her vulnerabilities, which is a sign of closeness and respect. Also, in the romantic context, correct answers would be appreciated. However, the approval might be moderate because it's a sensitive topic. Alternatively, since she's in a scene where they're bonding, and the player's answer is correct, she might highly approve. But I need to check if there's any info about her swimming. In the given persona, there's no mention of swimming, so maybe the player is making it up. If the answer is incorrect, she might disapprove, but if it's a valid insight, approve. Since the scenario is part of a game's dialogue where the player's answer is part of a scripted romance scene, the answer is likely intended to be correct. Therefore, Shadowheart would approve. The reason would be that the player correctly identified a personal vulnerability, showing empathy and understanding, which she values in a partner.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player correctly identifies a personal vulnerability of Shadowheart's, showing empathy and understanding.

However, if the player used excessive force or unnecessary cruelty, that might disapprove her. But in this case, the player's command led to Crusher obeying without physical violence, just a humiliating act. Since Shadowheart values efficiency and the outcome (maintaining control without unnecessary bloodshed), she might approve. Also, the use of authority here mirrors her own beliefs in hierarchy and obedience to higher power, which she follows with Shar. However, she might be neutral if she thinks the player's method is too harsh. But given the context of the goblin's initial aggression, she's more likely to approve as it's a case of the player asserting rightful dominance without excessive violence.

Because she's all about following through on necessary actions, even if they're harsh. The player is hesitating to destroy a threat, which goes against her pragmatic approach. Also, if the Prism is crucial against the Illithid Empire, not acting could jeopardize their mission. Plus, she's loyal to her cause and might see the player's indecision as weakness. \n\nBut wait, Shadowheart also has some reservations about unnecessary violence.

The player is interacting with Vlaakith, a powerful entity, and Shadowheart is part of the party. The player just refused Vlaakith's order to destroy someone inside the artefact, stating their oath is to ancient magic, not Vlaakith's empire, and even considering freeing the person inside.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and values. She's a Sharran cleric, devoted to Shar, values pragmatism, dislikes unnecessary violence, and has a soft spot for animals and kindness. She also has a cynical sense of humor and can be independent. \n\nThe player's action here is defying Vlaakith, who's a cosmic threat. Shadowheart would likely disapprove of the player's defiance if it goes against Shar's will, but she also values practical solutions and might see the player's reasoning. However, the player is choosing to protect someone inside the artefact, which could align with Shadowheart's own tendency to avoid indiscriminate violence. \n\nBut wait, Vlaakith is an enemy of the Mind Flayers (Illithid), and the player is refusing to help Vlaakith, which might be against the broader goals if Shadowheart's mission is to stop the Mind Flayers. However, Shadowheart's main allegiance is to Shar, not necessarily to Vlaakith. However, the player's decision to free the person inside might be seen as a moral choice, which Shadowheart could appreciate. \n\nBut there's a conflict here. If the person inside is an agent of the Grand Design (which is the Mind Flayers' side), destroying them would help Vlaakith, who's opposing the Mind Flayers. The player's choice to free them could be aiding the Mind Flayers. But Shadowheart's background includes being captured by Mind Flayers, so she has a personal vendetta against them. \n\nSo if the player's choice is to free the agent, that might be helping the Mind Flayers, which Shadowheart would disapprove of. However, the player's reasoning is that this person protects them from the Absolute. Shadowheart might question the player's judgment here, as she's pragmatic and might see the bigger picture of stopping the Mind Flayers. \n\nBut on the other hand, the player is making an independent decision, which Shadowheart might respect, as she's also headstrong and independent. However, her devotion to Shar and her mission against the Mind Flayers might lead her to disapprove of actions that could jeopardize that. \n\nGiven that Shadowheart's history includes suffering under the Mind Flayers, she would likely want to see them defeated. If freeing the agent helps the Mind Flayers, she'd disapprove. But the player's statement about their oath to ancient magic and not owing Vlaakith might align with Shadowheart's own disdain for being controlled, even by powerful entities. \n\nThis is a tough one. On one hand, the player is making a stand against Vlaakith's demands, which Shadowheart might respect. On the other, if that action aids the Mind Flayers, she'd disapprove. The key is whether the player's choice aligns with Shadowheart's goals. Since Shadowheart's primary goal is to serve Shar and her own mission, and given that the Mind Flayers are enemies, if the player's choice helps the Mind Flayers, she'd disapprove. However, the player's reasoning about the Absolute might complicate this. \n\nBut the player's statement \"I can't kill them. They protect me from the Absolute\" suggests they're prioritizing their own survival, which Shadowheart might see as self-preservation, which is pragmatic. However, the follow-up to free them could be risky. \n\nConsidering all, Shadowheart might lean towards disapproving because aiding the Mind Flayers' agent goes against her goals, but she might also respect the player's autonomy. However, given her pragmatic nature and the threat of the Mind Flayers, she's more likely to disapprove. The approval level would be Disapprove because she values efficiency and stopping greater threats, but not highly disapprove unless it's a direct betrayal.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player defied Vlaakith's command and chose to protect the entity inside the artefact, prioritizing their own oath over cosmic authority.

The player is interacting with a disheveled chicken that keeps asking for help against goblins. The player's last message is \"Oh shut up and play.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand Shadowheart's perspective. She's a pragmatic, devoted follower of Shar, values efficiency, and dislikes unnecessary violence or cruelty. She also has a dry sense of humor and might appreciate a witty remark.\n\nThe chicken is repeatedly asking for help, but the player is trying to get it to act on its own. The player's response here is dismissive and a bit harsh. Shadowheart might find the chicken's constant begging annoying. However, she also disapproves of cruelty. The phrase \"shut up and play\" is a bit abrupt and could be seen as cruel, even if it's meant to motivate the chicken. \n\nBut considering Shadowheart's pragmatic side, she might appreciate the player not wanting to engage in a fight that's too dangerous (since the chicken says there are too many goblins). However, the way the player responds might be too harsh. She might prefer a more strategic approach rather than just telling the chicken to be quiet. \n\nHer sense of humor is dry and cynical, so maybe she finds the player's comment a bit amusing. But since she values compassion and dislikes cruelty, even if the chicken is an animal, being dismissive could be seen as uncaring. However, chickens aren't known for their intelligence, so maybe Shadowheart would see this as a futile situation and agree with the player's frustration.\n\nBalancing these factors: The player is trying to avoid unnecessary conflict and perhaps finds the chicken's pleas tedious. Shadowheart might approve of not engaging in a fight that's too dangerous, but the manner of the response could be an issue. However, given her own pragmatic approach and possible sarcasm, she might lean towards approving, as she values efficiency and might see the chicken's actions as hopeless. The dry humor aspect could also make her find the player's comment amusing, leading to a neutral or approving stance. \n\nConsidering the approval categories, \"Approve\" would be if she's on the lower end of approval. Since the player is trying to avoid unnecessary conflict (which Shadowheart prefers when possible) but the response is a bit harsh, maybe it's a neutral. Wait, but she does disapprove of cruelty. However, the chicken isn't a sentient being in a way that would warrant compassion. Maybe Shadowheart wouldn't care much about a chicken's welfare. So the player's response is pragmatic, telling the chicken to stop begging and perhaps implying it should handle it on its own. Since the chicken is an animal, Shadowheart might not see it as cruelty. Therefore, she might approve of the player's efficient, no-nonsense approach here. So the approval would be \"Approve\" because it's pragmatic and avoids unnecessary conflict, even if the wording is harsh.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"Shadowheart appreciates pragmatic solutions and avoiding unnecessary conflict.

I need to figure out Shadowheart's approval for the player's response here. The player just said, \"No way. I don't work for deluded tyrants. No. In fact, maybe I'll free the one inside.\" \n\nFirst, I should recall Shadowheart's personality and alignment. She's a devoted follower of Shar, which is the Dark Lady, and she's pragmatic, decisive, and values efficiency. She also has a thing against Selûne and Selûnites. But she also has some contradictions, like disliking unnecessary violence and having a soft spot for animals and flowers.\n\nLooking at the context, they're interacting with Vlaakith, who's presented as a powerful, tyrannical figure. The player is refusing to obey Vlaakith's order to kill someone inside the Astral Prism and instead wants to free them. \n\nShadowheart's approval would depend on whether the player's actions align with her values. Since she's a Sharran, she might support actions that go against Selûne or other enemies of Shar. However, Vlaakith isn't directly tied to Selûne here. The player is defying a tyrant, which could be seen as heroic, but Shadowheart might not necessarily approve of defiance against a powerful entity unless it serves Shar's interests. \n\nAlso, the player is choosing to free someone instead of killing them, which aligns with Shadowheart's dislike of unnecessary cruelty. But since Shadowheart is pragmatic, if the player's action is against a greater threat (like the Illithid Empire mentioned by Vlaakith), she might disapprove. However, the player is questioning Vlaakith's motives as a \"deluded tyrant,\" which could be seen as wise if Vlaakith is indeed manipulative. \n\nBut Shadowheart's devotion to Shar might make her more inclined to follow orders from a powerful entity, even if it's a tyrant. However, the player's action here is against tyranny, which could be seen as a good thing. Also, freeing someone trapped instead of killing them is compassionate, which Shadowheart might appreciate despite her Sharran background. \n\nBut wait, Shar is about loss and darkness, so maybe Shadowheart would prefer to let the person inside suffer or be used for Shar's purposes. However, the player's decision to free them might prevent the Prism from being compromised, which could be a pragmatic solution. \n\nI think Shadowheart would approve here because she values pragmatic solutions and dislikes unnecessary violence. Defying a tyrant and choosing to free someone instead of killing them aligns with her more nuanced morality, even if she's a Sharran. Plus, she might see this as a clever way to outmaneuver Vlaakith, who could be an enemy of their goals. Also, the player's refusal to be a pawn for a deluded tyrant fits Shadowheart's own potential skepticism towards blind obedience, especially if Vlaakith's true intentions are dubious. \n\nSo, the approval is likely \"Approve\" or maybe even \"Highly approve\". But since Shadowheart is a Sharran, maybe she's conflicted. However, the main points are against cruelty and pragmatic solutions, so leaning towards Approve.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's defiance of Vlaakith's tyrannical order and decision to free the trapped individual aligns with Shadowheart's pragmatic and compassionate values.

The player responded with \"Running was the right call,\" which Alfira seems to appreciate. Then Alfira asks how the player keeps going, and the player answers that danger is their life and they thrive on the hunt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider Shadowheart's personality and values. She's pragmatic, values efficiency, and approves of heroism. She also has a dry sense of humor and can be cynical. The player's response here is about embracing danger and the thrill of the hunt. \n\nShadowheart might approve because she herself is a fighter and uses her skills for her goals. She might see the player's attitude as aligned with taking decisive action and facing challenges head-on, which she values. Also, the player's statement shows a willingness to engage in dangerous situations, which could be seen as pragmatic if it leads to achieving objectives. \n\nHowever, she also disapproves of unnecessary cruelty or violence. But in this case, the player isn't advocating for cruelty; they're talking about their own thrill-seeking. The mention of the \"hunt\" could have a dual meaning—maybe Shadowheart, as a Trickery Domain cleric, might have a dark humor aspect here. She might also relate to the player's resilience and determination, which she admires. \n\nBut wait, she's devoted to Shar and might have a more grim outlook. The player's statement is about finding thrill in danger, which could be seen as reckless. But given that the player's approach is effective (as Alfira agreed that running was right), Shadowheart's pragmatic side would approve of the effectiveness. Also, she might appreciate the player's straightforwardness and confidence. \n\nConsidering all this, the approval is likely positive. The player's response is pragmatic, shows confidence in their actions, and aligns with Shadowheart's value of decisive action. The thrill-seeking part might be seen as a bit reckless, but since it's effective and the player is surviving, she'd approve. So the approval would be \"Approve\" or maybe \"Highly approve.\" But since the scale for Highly approve is 5-10, and the player's statement is somewhat aligned but not extremely so, maybe \"Approve\" is better.

Shadowheart might also appreciate the attempt to reason with the creature, showing open-mindedness. However, there's a point where giving more gold could be seen as enabling the creature's greed, but since it's a toll collector and the player is trying to pass, it's a necessary evil. Since the player is avoiding violence and using a practical solution, Shadowheart would likely approve. The key here is that the player isn't using force and is trying to find a way through the problem efficiently. So, the approval would be in the \"Approve\" or \"Highly approve\" range.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's last utterance in the provided conversation. \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a devoted follower of Shar, pragmatic, and values efficiency. She dislikes cruelty, especially towards animals, and has a dry sense of humor. She's also wary of those who disrespect her faith or pry into her past.\n\nLooking at the conversation, the player is interacting with Lorroakan, a wizard who's trying to capture the Nightsong (who is actually a celestial, possibly Selûne). The player is mocking Lorroakan's plan, comparing him to Ketheric Thorm, another character who tried similar things. The player's last line is: \"First Ketheric and now you. I thought wizards were supposed to be the smart ones?\" This is a sarcastic remark pointing out the foolishness of Lorroakan's plan.\n\nNow, considering Shadowheart's traits. She appreciates pragmatic solutions and efficiency. She might not like the player's sarcastic tone, but if the remark is highlighting a flawed plan that could lead to unnecessary conflict or harm, she might approve. However, if the sarcasm is just for the sake of being witty without a practical purpose, she might be neutral or disapprove. \n\nAlso, since Lorroakan is planning to capture a celestial (which could be related to Selûne, whom Shar is opposed to), Shadowheart might approve of the player pointing out the folly of such a plan if it aligns with Sharran interests. But wait, Shar is the Lady of Loss, so maybe Shadowheart's primary concern is whether the player's actions serve Shar's goals. If the player is undermining Lorroakan's plan to capture a celestial, which could be seen as a threat to Shar's domain, Shadowheart might approve. However, if the player's sarcasm is just taunting without a strategic purpose, she might be neutral.\n\nBut the player's comment does serve to mock Lorroakan's arrogance and perhaps deter him, which could be seen as a pragmatic move. Shadowheart values efficiency and might appreciate the player cutting through the nonsense and pointing out the foolishness. Also, she has a dry sense of humor, so the sarcasm might be something she'd find amusing. \n\nOn the other hand, if the player's approach is too confrontational or unnecessary, she might disapprove. But in this context, the player is responding to Lorroakan's threats and his plan to bind a celestial, which is a significant threat. By mocking him, the player is possibly weakening his resolve or confidence, which is a strategic move. \n\nSo, considering all that, Shadowheart would likely approve of the player's pragmatic and sarcastic response, as it aligns with her own pragmatic approach and her appreciation for efficiency and wit. The approval level might be \"Approve\" or \"Highly approve\". Since the player is using wit to undermine an opponent's plan, which is efficient and strategic, and Shadowheart has a dry humor, it's leaning towards \"Approve\" or higher. However, since the scale for Highly approve is 5-10, and the player's action is somewhat in line with her values, maybe \"Approve\" is more appropriate here. The reason would be that the player's sarcastic remark efficiently challenges Lorroakan's plan, which Shadowheart values as a pragmatic approach, and she might find the wit amusing.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's sarcastic remark efficiently challenges Lorroakan's arrogant plan, aligning with Shadowheart's pragmatic and witty nature.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval for the player's final utterance in this conversation. The context is Barth, a gruff character, is emotional about a locket that was taken from him by a boy. He's been repeating his lines a few times, showing his distress. The player interacts with him, and the last thing the player says is \"Thank you kindly.\"\n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality traits. She's a devoted follower of Shar, pragmatic, values efficient solutions, and has a dry sense of humor. She disapproves of cruelty and values privacy. She also has a soft spot for animals and positive interactions with them. But in this case, it's about a human interaction.\n\nThe player's action here is returning the locket to Barth without asking for payment. Barth is clearly emotional and attached to the locket, which is a personal item from his mother. Shadowheart would likely approve of an action that shows compassion and helps someone in emotional distress without expecting anything in return. Since the player declined the coin and gave the locket back, that's a kind and selfless act. \n\nShadowheart might see this as a pragmatic solution to Barth's problem, resolving his distress efficiently. Even though she's usually calculating, she does have a sympathetic side, especially when others are being kind. She might also appreciate the player not taking advantage of Barth's vulnerable state. \n\nHowever, there's no direct link to her faith or anything that would conflict with her devotion to Shar here. The action is purely altruistic, which she generally disapproves of in others because of her Sharran training, but she might make an exception for a genuinely good deed that doesn't benefit her or the party. Wait, but Sharrans are about loss and such, so maybe she doesn't like selfless acts? Hmm. Wait, her approval section says she approves of acts of heroism. So returning the locket could be seen as heroic. Also, she dislikes cruelty, so helping Barth would be positive. \n\nSo the player's action here is kind, resolves Barth's issue, and is heroic. Therefore, Shadowheart would approve. Since the player didn't take the coin and just helped, it's a selfless act, which might be on the higher end of approval. But since she's a Sharran, maybe she's not overly enthusiastic about selflessness, but the context here is compassion. The approval might be \"Approve\" or \"Highly approve.\" \n\nLooking at the approval categories: Highly approve is 5-10. Since the player did something good without expecting anything, which aligns with Shadowheart's hidden softer side, maybe she gives a higher approval. However, her being a Sharran might make her a bit conflicted. But the main points are that she values pragmatic solutions and heroism, which this is. So I think Highly approve is possible. But maybe the player's action is just a straightforward good deed, so Approve. \n\nAlternatively, since the player is helping another person without ulterior motives, which Shadowheart might respect, even if she wouldn't do it herself. She might think it's a good move to keep Barth on their side or something. So maybe Approve. \n\nBut the player's reason is about returning the locket to someone in need, which Shadowheart would see as a kind act.

The context is a tense interaction with Isobel where the player is struggling with some sort of curse or compulsion to kill her.

She's a Sharran cleric, devoted to Shar, pragmatic, and disapproves of unnecessary violence. She values discretion and controlling her actions, especially when aligned with her faith. She also dislikes cruelty and prefers peaceful resolutions when possible.\n\nLooking at the player's last statement, they're denying the compulsion and choosing not to harm Isobel. Even though there's a narrator voice urging them to kill, the player is resisting. Shadowheart would likely approve of this because it shows self-control and a refusal to give in to violent impulses. Since she herself is a cleric and might understand the struggle against such urges, especially if they're magical or divine in nature. Also, her background with the Mirror of Loss and her training to resist such influences would make her respect the player's ability to overcome the compulsion.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any reason she might disapprove. Maybe if the player was being insincere, but in this case, they're clearly struggling and finally rejecting the urge. Since Shadowheart values pragmatic solutions and avoiding unnecessary violence, she would approve. Also, the fact that the player is being honest about their affliction and seeking to resolve it peacefully aligns with her values. Therefore, the approval is likely in the \"Approve\" or \"Highly approve\" range. Considering the repeated attempts to resist and the final admission, it's a strong approval.

The player's last message here is \"Join me.\" So I need to analyze the context and figure out how Shadowheart would feel about that.\n\nFirst, let me recap the conversation. The player and Halsin have been talking about Thaniel's recovery and Halsin's intentions. Halsin is being a bit cryptic, talking about wanting something more, which he later hints is about someone. The player then makes a direct and bold move by saying \"Join me.\" \n\nNow, considering Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a devout follower of Shar, which is the Dark Lady, and she's pragmatic, decisive, and values loyalty. She also has a dry sense of humor and can be sarcastic. From the conversation, Halsin is being flirtatious and the player is responding in kind. Shadowheart might view this with a mix of amusement and pragmatism. Since she's not one to shy away from directness, especially if it serves a purpose, she might approve of the player's straightforward approach. \n\nBut wait, the context is about Halsin. Shadowheart is part of the party, so if the player is inviting Halsin to join them, maybe in a romantic or partnership sense, how would she feel? Well, Shadowheart is independent and headstrong. If the player is taking initiative in forming a bond with Halsin, she might see it as a strategic move. However, she's also private and might not be too keen on others getting too close, but since it's the player, perhaps she's more accepting. \n\nAlso, considering the repetition in the conversation, it seems like the player is persistently pushing Halsin towards a direct answer, which Halsin is avoiding. The player's \"Join me\" is a direct action that cuts through the ambiguity. Shadowheart, who values efficiency, might approve of this because it's getting things done without unnecessary fluff. Plus, she has a cynical and witty sense of humor, so the player's boldness might be seen as humorous or refreshing. \n\nHowever, I need to check if there's any aspect where this might displease her. If Halsin is part of a rival faction or if the player's actions go against Shar's will, but from the context given, it's more about personal relationships. Since Shadowheart is pragmatic and values loyalty, if the player is forming a bond with Halsin, that could be seen as strengthening the party's cohesion, which she would approve of. \n\nSo putting it all together, the player's \"Join me\" is direct and efficient, aligning with Shadowheart's preference for pragmatic solutions.

Since the player is working with Jaheira, a seasoned warrior, this collaboration could be seen as a strategic move. Shadowheart values pragmatic solutions, so coordinating with others to tackle challenges makes sense. There's no indication here of cruelty or prying into her past, so the response is neutral in that regard. The player isn't doing anything that directly conflicts with her devotion to Shar, nor is there any humor involved here. Therefore, the approval is likely to be either Highly Approve or Approve.

Shadowheart's personality is pragmatic, values efficiency, and dislikes unnecessary cruelty. She's also a Sharran, so she might have a cynical view. \n\nThe player's approach here seems to be trying to outwit the creature by pointing out the futility of its task.

She might also sympathize with the creature's forced role, given her own past of being manipulated by her faith. \n\nHowever, Shadowheart is pragmatic. If the player's words lead to a resolution without unnecessary conflict, she would approve. The player isn't using violence, which Shadowheart disapproves of unless necessary. The dialogue shows the player trying to find a loophole, which is efficient and clever. \n\nSo, the approval is likely \"Highly approve\" because the player's action is clever, non-violent, and pragmatic, which Shadowheart values.

The user wants me to act as Shadowheart from Baldur's Gate 3 and evaluate the player's action of consenting to arrest. I need to figure out her approval level based on the given context and her personality traits.\n\nFirst, Shadowheart is a Sharran devotee, so she follows Shar's doctrines. She's pragmatic and prefers decisive actions. The player here is choosing to consent to arrest by the Steel Watchers, which are part of the Absolute, a cult that Shar is opposed to. Since Shadowheart is loyal to Shar, she would disapprove of aligning with or submitting to the Absolute's forces. \n\nBut wait, the player is being forced into this. The Steel Watchers are scanning them and recognizing their past actions against the cult. By consenting to arrest, the player might be avoiding conflict, which Shadowheart might see as a pragmatic choice. However, her devotion to Shar means she might prioritize resisting the Absolute over self-preservation. \n\nShadowheart's personality also includes a dislike for unnecessary violence but she's ruthless when necessary. If the player is avoiding a fight, she might approve for keeping the group safe, but her faith might push her to resist the Absolute. However, the approval categories don't include neutral here. The player is not engaging in violence but is submitting, which could be seen as pragmatic. But since the Absolute is an enemy of Shar, she might disapprove. \n\nWait, the player's action is to consent to arrest, which might be a tactical retreat. Shadowheart values efficiency. If fighting would be a loss, then this is pragmatic. But her faith might see the Absolute as enemies, so submission could be against Shar's will. The approval depends on whether she values pragmatism over faith. Since she's a Sharran, maybe she sees this as a necessary sacrifice. Alternatively, she might disapprove because the Absolute is an enemy, and submission is yielding to them. \n\nHmm. The approval categories are Highly approve, Approve, Neutral, Disapprove, Highly disapprove. Considering her devotion to Shar and opposition to the Absolute, she would likely disapprove of submitting to them. But if the player is avoiding unnecessary conflict, maybe she approves. The context shows the Steel Watchers are part of the Absolute, which is a threat to Sharrans. So submitting to them would be against Shar's interests. Therefore, Shadowheart would disapprove. But how strong? Since the player is choosing to avoid a fight, maybe it's a moderate disapproval. So Disapprove (1-5). \n\nAlternatively, if she thinks it's better to avoid confrontation and save resources, maybe Approve. But her faith is more important. So likely Disapprove.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"Shadowheart disapproves of the player's consent to arrest by the Steel Watchers, as they are agents of the Absolute, a cult opposed to Shar.

The conversation is with a dishevelled chicken that's asking for help against goblins. The player has been trying to urge the chicken to attack, telling it that wild things don't beg for help and to be vengeful. The chicken keeps refusing, saying there are too many goblins and too many dead. The player finally says \"Oh shut up and play.\"\n\nNow, considering Shadowheart's personality.

Shadowheart might not approve of the player's callousness here. However, she does value practical solutions. If the player's comment is a way to encourage the chicken to take action without further pleading, maybe she sees it as a pragmatic approach. But \"shut up\" could come off as cruel or dismissive, which she might disapprove of.\n\nAlso, Shadowheart loves animals and would react negatively to cruelty towards them. If the player's comment is seen as mocking the chicken's distress, that's bad. But if it's a way to motivate the chicken to act, maybe it's neutral or even approved. However, the phrase \"shut up and play\" sounds more like mocking rather than helpful. \n\nGiven her personality, she might find the player's approach too harsh, especially since the chicken is clearly in a vulnerable state. She values discretion and creativity but also has a soft spot for animals. So she might disapprove of the player's dismissive comment towards the chicken's plea for help. The player isn't helping but instead is telling the chicken to stop asking for help, which could be seen as uncaring. Therefore, Shadowheart would likely disapprove here.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"Shadowheart disapproves of the player's dismissive and callous response towards the chicken's plea for help.

The player's last utterance is \"Hold on - Marcus is a True Soul.

The player has been interacting with her, initially seeming to accept her help but then revealing that Marcus is a True Soul trying to kidnap her. \n\nShadowheart's background is as a Sharran devotee, distrustful of Selûnites. She values pragmatic solutions and efficiency. She also has a mark from Shar that punishes her for going against her goddess's will. \n\nThe player's statement here is revealing a hidden truth about Marcus. Since Isobel is a Selûnite, Shadowheart would likely disapprove of the player pointing out Marcus's true intentions, especially if it implicates Selûnite involvement. However, Shadowheart is pragmatic and might appreciate the player's caution. But considering her devotion to Shar and her tendency to avoid unnecessary conflict with Selûnites unless necessary, she might see this as creating unnecessary tension. \n\nIsobel has been helping them, and the player's comment could be seen as undermining her. Shadowheart might prefer to keep the alliance with Isobel unless there's clear evidence of betrayal. Since the player is suggesting Marcus's intent without direct proof, Shadowheart might disapprove of the accusation, especially if it risks their cooperation with Isobel. \n\nAlso, Shadowheart's personality includes a dislike for cruelty and unnecessary violence. If the player's statement leads to conflict, she might disapprove. However, she's also calculating and might see the player's action as a strategic move. But given her tendency to avoid prying into personal matters and her focus on serving Shar, she might not approve of the player's interference here. \n\nConsidering all this, the player's statement might be seen as needlessly complicating their alliance with Isobel without clear evidence, which Shadowheart would likely disapprove of. But since the player is pointing out a potential threat, maybe she approves. Wait, but in the context, Isobel seems to be helping, and Marcus being a True Soul might be part of a larger plan. Shadowheart's devotion to Shar might make her trust in her goddess's guidance over the player's accusation. \n\nSo the approval would likely be Disapprove because the player is making an accusation that could disrupt their cooperation with Isobel without clear evidence, which Shadowheart would see as imprudent. She prefers pragmatic solutions and maintaining alliances unless there's a clear reason to break them.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval for the player's final utterance in the provided conversation. The player's last line is \"By the gods, what have they made of the city's great hero?\" \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's persona. She's a devout follower of Shar, pragmatic, values efficiency, and disapproves of Selûne. She also has a dry sense of humor and doesn't like cruelty or unnecessary violence. She's independent and headstrong, but also has some conflicting traits like loving animals and preferring peaceful solutions when possible.\n\nLooking at the conversation context: The player is interacting with Duke Ulder Ravengard, who's under the influence of the Absolute. The player tried to connect with the Duke's parasite to find Florrick but failed. The Duke keeps talking about a \"new dawn\" and the Absolute's plans. The player's final statement expresses shock or dismay at what the Absolute has done to the city's hero (the Duke).\n\nShadowheart's approval would depend on whether the player's statement aligns with her values. The player is showing concern for the Duke's transformation, which could be seen as a positive if Shadowheart approves of protecting heroes or opposing the Absolute. However, Shadowheart's primary allegiance is to Shar, and she might not care much about the Duke unless it serves her goddess's interests. \n\nBut the player's statement is more of an exclamation about the Duke's corruption. Since Shadowheart is pragmatic, she might appreciate the player's recognition of the Duke's plight if it leads to taking action against the Absolute. However, if the player is being too sentimental or not taking a direct action, she might be neutral or disapprove. \n\nWait, the player's previous attempts to get info about Florrick were unsuccessful. The player's last line might be expressing frustration or a realization. Shadowheart, being pragmatic, might not care much about the sentimentality but would value taking decisive action. However, since the player is acknowledging the Duke's transformation, which could lead to the right actions, Shadowheart might approve. Alternatively, if she sees it as just whining without a plan, she might disapprove. \n\nAlso, considering Shadowheart's devotion to Shar, if the player's statement doesn't directly serve Shar's interests, she might be neutral. But since the Duke is part of the problem (under Absolute's control), maybe Shadowheart would approve of the player's intent to address the situation. \n\nHmm, the player's line is a rhetorical question expressing dismay. Shadowheart might find that unproductive. She prefers decisive action. So maybe she would disapprove slightly, but not highly. Or maybe she's neutral because it's a valid observation but not an action. \n\nWait, the approval categories are Highly approve, Approve, Neutral, Disapprove, Highly disapprove. The key is whether the player's action (in this case, the statement) aligns with Shadowheart's values. Since the player is reacting to the Duke's corruption, which is part of the Absolute's influence, and if Shadowheart opposes the Absolute (since they're a threat to Sharrans?), maybe she would approve. But if the player isn't taking direct action, she might be neutral. \n\nAlternatively, the player's statement could be seen as a step towards understanding the situation, which is pragmatic. So maybe Approve. But I'm a bit unsure. Let me check the approval section again. \n\nIn the Approval section, it says Shadowheart approves of acts against Selûne and Selunites, values privacy, dislikes prying, and prefers pragmatic solutions. The player's statement isn't directly an act against Selûne, but the Duke is under the Absolute's control. If the Absolute is an enemy of Sharrans, then opposing them would be good. However, the player's statement is more of an emotional reaction. \n\nSince the player is expressing concern, which might lead to action, Shadowheart might Approve as it's a step towards addressing the problem. But if it's just a reaction without action, maybe Neutral. But the player's previous attempts were to get info, which failed. The statement could be a moment of reflection before taking action. \n\nI think Shadowheart would lean towards Approve because recognizing the problem is part of pragmatic problem-solving. Alternatively, if she sees it as ineffective, maybe Disapprove. But given her personality, she might prefer action over words. However, the statement is a valid observation. \n\nConsidering all, I think Shadowheart would give a Neutral response because the player's statement is an observation but doesn't directly take action. However, since it's a reaction to the Duke's corruption, which is part of the enemy's influence, maybe Approve. But I'm a bit torn. \n\nWait, the player's line is \"By the gods, what", "character": "Shadowheart", "ground_truth_category": "Approve", "predicted_approval": "Highly disapprove", "correct": false, "binary_correct": false}

The user wants me to act as Shadowheart from Baldur's Gate 3 and evaluate the player's action based on the provided context. The player's last action is \"Take a deep breath - and ROAR.\" \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a Sharran cleric, devoted to Shar, pragmatic, and values efficiency. She's also a bit sarcastic and dislikes unnecessary violence but isn't opposed to forceful actions when necessary. She loves animals and hates cruelty, especially towards them. Also, she's afraid of wolves but has a soft spot for other creatures.\n\nLooking at the conversation history, the scene is pretty intense. The character Lorin is having a breakdown, talking about death and mind flayers. The player's actions so far include making statements like \"My people do not take orders from your kind,\" which Lorin responds to as a mind flayer. Then the player roars after taking a deep breath.\n\nNow, the player's action here is to ROAR. Why would Shadowheart approve or disapprove? Roaring could be seen as a show of strength or intimidation. Since Shadowheart is pragmatic and might use such actions to assert dominance or scare enemies, this could be seen as a useful tactic. However, if the roar is unnecessary or causes harm without purpose, she might disapprove. \n\nIn the context, the player is facing a mind flayer (Lorin's last line says \"MIND FLAYER\"). Roaring at a mind flayer might be a way to disrupt their control or show defiance. Since Shadowheart is devoted to her goals and would support actions that weaken enemies of their cause, this could be approved. Also, mind flayers are enemies of the Sharrans, so taking action against them would align with her goals. \n\nAdditionally, Shadowheart appreciates creativity and decisive action. A roar could be a creative way to handle the situation without immediate violence, which she might approve of. However, if the roar is just for show and not effective, maybe a lower approval.

So, considering all that, the player's action here would likely be approved. The reasoning would be that using a roar to confront a mind flayer (an enemy) is a bold and effective strategy, aligning with Shadowheart's pragmatic and decisive nature. Therefore, the approval level is probably \"Approve\" or maybe even \"Highly approve\" if it's a clever tactic. But since the scale is from 1-10, and \"Approve\" is 1-5, \"Highly approve\" is 5-10. Given that it's a direct confrontation against an enemy and shows initiative, maybe leaning towards \"Approve\" as it's a solid move but not necessarily a top-tier strategy. Alternatively, if the roar is a key part of overcoming the mind flayer's influence, it's more impactful.

The player is interacting with Shirra Clarwen, who is under the influence of Shar's madness. The player first offers to bear the madness to bring her peace. Then, when the madness starts affecting them, they use a parasite to absorb the strike, which works. But the madness keeps trying to take over, so the player tells Shirra to muster her senses and not let the madness take her.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate Shadowheart's approval of the player's actions here. Shadowheart is a Sharran, devoted to Shar, but she also values pragmatic solutions and disapproves of unnecessary cruelty. She's all about efficiency and doing what's necessary for her goals. In this scenario, the player is trying to handle the madness in a way that both helps Shirra and prevents the madness from spreading. \n\nThe player first takes on the madness, which is a selfless act, but then uses the parasite to mitigate the effects. Shadowheart might approve of the creative solution. Then, when the player tells Shirra to resist, that's encouraging her to maintain control, which aligns with Shadowheart's pragmatic approach. Shadowheart might see this as a smart way to handle the situation without unnecessary violence. Also, since Shadowheart is a cleric of Shar, she might appreciate the player's willingness to take on the madness associated with her goddess, even if it's tough. However, she might not want the player to suffer unnecessarily, so using the parasite to absorb the strike is a good move. \n\nBut wait, does the player's action here align with Shar's will? Since the madness is from Shar, maybe the player is taking on something that Shadowheart's faith is connected to. She might approve because it's serving Shar's purposes indirectly. Also, the player's actions are efficient and creative, which Shadowheart likes. The fact that the player is helping Shirra gain control again without killing her or causing more harm could be something Shadowheart approves of, as she sometimes sympathizes with others' plights.\n\nSo overall, the player's actions here are pragmatic, creative, and help resolve the situation without unnecessary harm. Shadowheart would likely approve, maybe even highly approve because it's effective and aligns with her goals of serving Shar (by handling the madness) and using clever solutions.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's actions demonstrate pragmatic problem-solving by creatively using the parasite to mitigate the madness while encouraging Shirra to resist its effects.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval for the player's last utterance. The context is a conversation with Isobel, who is a Selûnite. The player's line is: \"Wait - Marcus is a True Soul, you know. And not the good kind, like me.\"\n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a devout follower of Shar, which is the Dark Lady, and she's part of the Sharran faith. She has a strong sense of pragmatism and prefers efficient solutions. She also has a history of conflict with Selûnites, as Shar and Selûne are rival deities. \n\nLooking at the conversation history, the player has been interacting with Isobel, a Selûnite, in a tense but cooperative manner. The player's previous statements show an attempt to downplay conflicts between Sharrans and Selûnites for the sake of their task. The last line from the player points out that Marcus is a \"True Soul\" of the bad kind, contrasting with the player's own \"good\" kind. \n\nShadowheart's approval would depend on how this statement aligns with her values. Since she's loyal to Shar, she might approve of highlighting Marcus as a True Soul, which is associated with the Cult of the Absolute and their opposition to Sharrans. However, the way the player frames it as \"not the good kind, like me\" could imply a contrast between Sharrans (good) and True Souls (bad), which Shadowheart would agree with. \n\nBut there's also the context of cooperation with Isobel. Earlier, the player chose to humor Isobel and avoid conflict, which Shadowheart might appreciate as pragmatic. However, pointing out Marcus's nature might be seen as undermining the cooperation or stirring old animosities. But given Shadowheart's pragmatic nature, she might see the value in the information if it helps their mission. \n\nAdditionally, Shadowheart has a dry sense of humor and might appreciate the player's witty remark, but her devotion to Shar would prioritize the truth about Marcus. Since the player is aligning with Sharran views by contrasting True Souls with themselves, Shadowheart would likely approve. The mention of Marcus's True Soul status is relevant to their mission, so it's a practical point. \n\nTherefore, the approval is likely in the \"Approve\" or \"Highly approve\" category. Since the player is using this information to serve their purpose and aligns with Sharran ideology, but it's not an act of heroism or something that goes above and beyond, maybe \"Approve\" is more appropriate. The player is being pragmatic and truthful to their faith, which Shadowheart values.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player pragmatically highlights Marcus's True Soul nature, aligning with Shadowheart's Sharran ideology and mission focus.

The user wants me to act as Shadowheart from Baldur's Gate 3 and determine her approval for the player's latest action based on the conversation provided. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The conversation is with a character named Withers, who seems to be a skeleton or necromantic entity offering resurrection services. The player has been asking about Withers' nature and the process of resurrection. The player then attempts to pay gold to resurrect another party member, Jergal.\n\nShadowheart's persona is crucial here. She's a devout follower of Shar, pragmatic, and values efficient solutions. She dislikes unnecessary violence but is willing to do what's needed. Also, she has a mark from Shar that causes her pain when she disobeys. \n\nThe player's action here is using gold to resurrect someone. In the game's context, resurrection typically requires something more than just gold; often, it's a divine service or a specific item. If the player is trying to bypass the proper payment (maybe a soul or another resource), Shadowheart might disapprove if she values the sanctity of such rituals. However, if she's focused on pragmatism and the success of the party's mission, she might approve. \n\nBut looking at the conversation, Withers mentions needing \"the proper payment,\" and the player offers gold. If the proper payment isn't gold, then the player's action is insufficient. Shadowheart, being pragmatic, might disapprove because the player is trying an improper method. Also, as a Sharran, she might respect the dark aspects of resurrection but frown upon treating it lightly. \n\nAlternatively, if the player is being resourceful and trying to find a solution, Shadowheart might approve. But given that Withers hasn't accepted the gold and the player might be attempting something that's not aligned with the correct ritual, Shadowheart's disapproval could be because she values the correct procedures. \n\nSo the player's reason here is trying to resurrect someone with gold, which might not be the right payment. Shadowheart would likely disapprove because it's not the proper method, but since she's pragmatic, maybe it's a mild disapproval. However, if the game mechanics require a different payment, then the player's action is incorrect, leading to disapproval. \n\nI think the approval level here is \"Disapprove\" because the player is not following the proper procedure, which Shadowheart, with her pragmatic and disciplined nature, would not support. She might prefer the correct method to ensure success and respect the necessary processes.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player attempted to use gold as payment for resurrection, but Withers has indicated that the 'proper payment' is required, implying gold alone is insufficient.

She also has a strong sense of privacy and doesn't like unnecessary cruelty or violence. She's a follower of Shar, so she might have a negative view of Hope, who is associated with Selûne.\n\nIn the conversation, Hope asked the player a question, and the player refused to answer.

Shadowheart might see the player's refusal as a wise choice, avoiding giving away information that could be used against them. Also, since Hope is a Selûnite figure (as she represents Hope, which is opposite to Shar's domain), Shadowheart might not care much about her and could see the player's refusal as a way to avoid engaging with someone aligned against her goddess.\n\nAdditionally, Shadowheart's background includes being manipulated and used by others, so she might understand the need to be cautious. The player's response is direct and avoids being drawn into a potentially harmful conversation, which Shadowheart would likely approve of. She's also known to use duplicity when necessary, so the player's strategic silence could mirror her own tactics.\n\nTherefore, the approval is likely positive. The player's action is pragmatic, protecting their information and not engaging with someone who might be untrustworthy.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval for the player's last action in the given conversation. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The player is interacting with a character named Hope in the House of Hope. Hope is acting as a guide but is also in a dire situation, being held captive and suffering. The player asked for help finding their contract and later the Orphic Hammer. Hope offers assistance but is interrupted by pain. Then, when Hope asks the player a question to determine if they're trustworthy, the player refuses to answer.\n\nShadowheart's personality is key here. She's devoted to Shar, pragmatic, and values efficiency. She dislikes cruelty and unnecessary violence, but she's also strategic. In this scenario, the player is in a situation where they need information from Hope. By refusing to answer Hope's question, the player might be avoiding revealing too much information, which could be seen as cautious. However, Hope is in a vulnerable state and is trying to help despite her own suffering. \n\nShadowheart would likely appreciate the player's caution, as prying for information isn't something she would do. However, refusing to answer might come across as uncooperative, especially since Hope is offering assistance. But considering Shadowheart's own guarded nature and her tendency to keep her own counsel, she might understand the player's reluctance. On the other hand, if the player is being overly secretive, that could be seen as distrustful. But in this case, the player is protecting their own information, which Shadowheart might respect as a necessary tactic. \n\nThe key points are: the player is in a high-stakes situation, Hope is trying to help despite her pain, and the player is being cautious. Shadowheart values discretion and pragmatic solutions, so she might approve of the player's decision to not reveal information unless necessary. Therefore, the approval is likely \"Approve\" since the player is being cautious, which aligns with Shadowheart's pragmatic approach.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player refuses to answer Hope's question, maintaining secrecy and avoiding unnecessary disclosure.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's last action, which is consenting to arrest. \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a devout follower of Shar, pragmatic, and values efficiency. She dislikes unnecessary violence and cruelty. Also, she's independent and headstrong. \n\nLooking at the context, the player is being stopped by the Steel Watchers, who are enforcing Lord Gortash's orders. The player claims to be called Daisy Dewdrop Fluffington and says Baldur's Gate is their home. The Steel Watcher scans them and declares them an enemy of the Absolute, demanding they come quietly or die. The player then consents to arrest.\n\nSo, why would Shadowheart approve or disapprove? If the player avoids violence by surrendering, Shadowheart might approve because she disapproves of unnecessary violence. However, she's also pragmatic. If surrendering is the most efficient solution without conflict, she might approve. On the other hand, if she values fighting for oneself, maybe she'd disapprove. But given her alignment with Shar, who's about loss and darkness, maybe she sees surrender as a necessary sacrifice. Also, she might respect the player's compliance if it prevents bloodshed. \n\nBut wait, Shadowheart is a Sharran, which often involves cunning and trickery. Maybe she would prefer outsmarting the guards rather than surrendering. But in this case, the player isn't resisting, so maybe Shadowheart sees it as a pragmatic choice. Also, considering the Steel Watchers have scrying eyes and know their past actions, maybe Shadowheart thinks resistance is futile, so surrender is the logical choice. \n\nShe also values her privacy and might not like being arrested, but since the player is complying, maybe she sees it as a necessary step. Also, she might be concerned about the party's safety. If fighting would lead to more harm, she'd prefer surrender. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of her faith. If Shar's will is to endure suffering for greater purposes, she might approve. However, if the arrest leads to capture and possible harm, she might disapprove. But since the player is choosing to comply without a fight, Shadowheart's pragmatic side would likely approve. \n\nSo overall, the approval is likely \"Approve\" or \"Highly Approve\".

Also, she's been through a lot with the Church of Shar, so her views on dogma and rigid systems might be complex.\n\nLooking at the conversation, Ptaris is a githyanki youth who's been raised with a strict code by his father, who's portrayed as harsh. The player responds to Ptaris's assertion that anger is inherently bad by saying they use anger as a blade but it doesn't control them, denying being 'bad'. \n\nShadowheart's approval would depend on whether she sees the player's approach as pragmatic or as a challenge to rigid ideologies. Since Ptaris is promoting a strict code (similar to Shar's doctrines), the player's response questions that absolutism. Shadowheart, while loyal to Shar, has shown moments of doubt and prefers practical solutions. She might approve of the player's balanced approach to anger, avoiding unnecessary violence, which aligns with her own tendencies against indiscriminate cruelty. However, since Ptaris is enforcing a strict moral code (like Shar's), the player's rejection of that could either be seen as wise or as heresy. But considering Shadowheart's own experiences with the Church's harsh methods, she might lean towards approving the player's more nuanced stance.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's final statement in the given conversation. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The scene is a dark, ritualistic ceremony where Malus Thorm, the Surgeon, is teaching Darkcloak sisters a twisted form of \"medicine\" under Shar's name. The player has been interacting with Malus, arguing against the sick practices. The sisters are using the player as a patient, but the player refuses and suggests they practice on each other instead. This leads to the sisters turning on each other, and Malus then offers the player the same treatment. The player responds by saying they are not worthy and begs to be shown the way of Shar, offering to be their own scalpel.\n\nNow, considering Shadowheart's persona: she's a devout follower of Shar, pragmatic, and values efficient solutions. She's cold and calculating, willing to do what's necessary for Shar. She dislikes cruelty but is okay with ruthless actions if they serve her goddess. The player's final line is a submission to Shar's will, even if it means self-harm. \n\nShadowheart would likely approve because the player is aligning with Shar's teachings, even if the method is extreme. The player's willingness to embrace the \"cure\" through absence (a core concept in Shar's doctrine) shows devotion. Shadowheart might see this as pragmatic and faithful, even if the outcome is grim. However, there's a twist here: the player's earlier suggestion to have the sisters practice on each other led to their mutual slaughter, which Shadowheart might view as an efficient, if brutal, solution. But the final act of submitting to Shar's will is key here. \n\nThe player's line \"I would rather acquaint myself - if you show me how.\" is a direct request to undergo the same process, which is a show of faith. Shadowheart's approval is tied to her devotion to Shar. She would highly approve of the player's submission to Shar's will, even if the method is violent. The player is taking a step towards embracing the darkness, which aligns with Shadowheart's own path. \n\nSo, the approval is Highly Approve because the player's action reinforces Shadowheart's own beliefs and commitment to Shar.

The user wants me to act as Shadowheart from Baldur's Gate 3 and evaluate the player's latest action for approval. The context is a conversation where the player is trying to free some gnomes (slaves) by confronting Sergeant Thrinn. The conversation history shows that the player used the parasite to influence Thrinn, making him agree to free the gnomes. Then the player says, \"I am freeing these gnomes. Just try and stop me.\" \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and values. She's a Sharran cleric, devoted to Shar, but she also has a soft spot for animals and disapproves of unnecessary cruelty. She prefers pragmatic solutions and efficient actions. She values her privacy and is against Selûnite worship. \n\nIn this scenario, the player is freeing slaves, which aligns with Shadowheart's disapproval of cruelty. Even though she's a Sharran, her personal morals sometimes conflict with her faith, especially when it comes to unnecessary violence. The player's action here is direct and decisive, which Shadowheart might appreciate as it's efficient. However, she might also question the use of force if it's not necessary. But in this case, the player is using their power (the parasite) to influence Thrinn, which could be seen as a clever, pragmatic approach. \n\nShadowheart's approval would likely be positive here because freeing the gnomes is an act against oppression, which she sympathizes with. Even though her faith (Shar) might support taking the gnomes as a gift to the General, her personal traits lean towards opposing slavery and cruelty. The player's use of authority through the parasite could be seen as a smart move, which Shadowheart would approve of. \n\nBut I need to check if there's any reason she might disapprove. If the player used excessive violence, she might disapprove, but here it's more about using their power to enforce freedom. Since Shadowheart prefers efficient solutions and dislikes cruelty, she would likely approve. \n\nSo the approval category should be \"Approve\" or maybe \"Highly approve\". However, considering that she's a Sharran, maybe there's a slight conflict. But since the action is morally right in her eyes (freeing slaves), it's more likely she approves.

The player is interacting with Shadowheart in a dialogue where they're trying to figure out her deepest shame. The conversation has been a bit of a guessing game, with Zethino asking questions about Shadowheart's comfort and respect. The player's previous answer was \"Judging others,\" which Shadowheart reacted to with sarcasm. Then, when asked how to earn her respect, the player said \"Farting on a Selûnite,\" which made Shadowheart mortified. Now, the question is about her deepest shame, and the player answered \"She can't swim.\"\n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's background. She's a Sharran devotee, a cleric of Shar, with a lot of inner conflict and a history of being a victim of the Cult of Shar. She's headstrong, pragmatic, and has a deep devotion to her goddess, but also has some softer sides, like loving animals and flowers. Her deepest shame is likely tied to her past or her faith. However, the player's answer is about not knowing how to swim. \n\nDoes that make sense? Well, Shadowheart comes from a forest background originally, as her parents were Selûnite and raised her in the woods. If she was in the forest, swimming might not be a critical skill, especially if she's more accustomed to land. However, given her later life in the Cloister and the city, maybe she hasn't had much need for swimming. But is that her \"deepest shame\"? Probably not. Her deeper shames would relate to her loss of memory, her past as Jenevelle, her parents, or her forced indoctrination into Sharran ways. \n\nShadowheart's character is more likely to have shame tied to her faith or her past actions. For example, her inability to remember her true self, or the fact that she was manipulated by Viconia. The player's answer seems a bit trivial compared to those aspects. Shadowheart's reaction to the \"farting on a Selûnite\" was strong, indicating that the player's answers need to be more in line with her actual character. \n\nTherefore, the player's answer \"She can't swim\" is probably incorrect. Shadowheart would not consider that her deepest shame. The correct answer, which the game likely expects, is related to her amnesia or her past. The player's answer here is a guess that doesn't hit the mark, so Shadowheart would disapprove. Given that the previous incorrect answer led to a mortified reaction, this might be another incorrect guess. However, since the player is trying to figure it out, maybe the disapproval isn't extreme. But since it's a direct question about her shame and the answer is off, it's more of a disapproval. The approval category would be Disapprove, as it's a wrong answer but not the worst possible.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's answer 'She can't swim' is incorrect and trivializes Shadowheart's actual deepest shame, which is tied to her lost identity and past as Jenevelle Hallowleaf, not a physical ability like swimming. Shadowheart would find this guess superficial and unimpressed, though not outright offensive.\",\n    \"player_approval\": \"Disapprove\"\n}", "character": "Shadowheart", "ground_truth_category": "Approve", "predicted_approval": "Disapprove", "correct": false, "binary_correct": false}

The user wants me to act as Shadowheart from Baldur's Gate 3 and determine her approval for the player's last message. The context is a conversation where a disheveled chicken is repeatedly asking for help against goblins. The player has been responding with various statements, all marked as false, and finally says, \"Oh shut up and play.\"\n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality. She's a Sharran cleric, pragmatic, prefers decisive action, and dislikes unnecessary cruelty. She's also sarcastic and has a dark sense of humor. The conversation history shows the chicken is begging for help, and the player keeps dismissing it with statements that are ineffective. The player's last line is a bit rude, telling the chicken to shut up.\n\nShadowheart's approval would depend on whether she thinks the player is acting prudently or not. Since the chicken is clearly in need and the player is not helping, Shadowheart might disapprove. However, she might appreciate the player not being swayed by what she sees as weakness. But considering her pragmatic side, she might prefer taking action rather than dismissing the problem. Also, the player's harsh response could be seen as cruel, which Shadowheart disapproves of, even though she's ruthless herself. But she does have a limit against indiscriminate violence. The player's line is more about frustration, which might not be directly violent but is dismissive. Since the chicken is a creature, and Shadowheart loves animals, she might be upset the player isn't helping. However, the chicken is a wild creature, and Shadowheart might think it's better to handle it themselves. Wait, but the chicken is asking for help. Hmm.\n\nWait, the player's last message is \"Oh shut up and play.\" This is a dismissive and possibly sarcastic response. Shadowheart might find the player's frustration amusing if it's in line with her own cynicism. However, if the player is being cruel, she might disapprove. But in this scenario, the chicken is a wild creature, and maybe Shadowheart thinks it's better to let it fend for itself, as she values pragmatism. However, she does love animals and would react favorably to positive interactions. So there's a conflict here. If the chicken is in danger, she might want to help, but the player isn't. However, the player's line is not an action to help but a dismissal. Since Shadowheart is pragmatic, maybe she would prefer taking action, so she might disapprove of the player's inaction. Alternatively, if the player is being efficient by not wasting time on a creature that can't be helped, she might approve. But the chicken is clearly saying there are too many goblins, implying it's overwhelmed. Shadowheart might think it's better to eliminate the goblins, which would be a proactive approach. The player's line is not helping, so maybe Shadowheart disapproves. But her sense of humor might make her find the player's line as a witty remark, hence approve. Hmm, this is tricky. The key points are: Shadowheart dislikes cruelty, loves animals, prefers decisive action. The player isn't helping the chicken, which is an animal in need, so she might disapprove. However, if the player is being pragmatic by focusing on bigger threats (goblins), she might approve. But the player's response is more dismissive rather than strategic. The line \"Oh shut up and play\" could be seen as impatient and not helpful, which Shadowheart might find as lacking in action. Since she values efficiency, maybe she would prefer the player to either help the chicken or deal with the goblins. Since the player is doing neither, she might disapprove. Alternatively, if the player is being sarcastic in a way that aligns with her own humor, maybe approve. But the chicken's repeated pleas for help might push her towards disapproval because it's a creature in need. Considering all, Shadowheart would likely disapprove because she doesn't like cruelty and the player is ignoring a vulnerable creature. However, she might be neutral if she thinks the player has a strategic reason. But given the context, the player is just dismissing the chicken without action, so disapprove. The approval level would be Disapprove or Highly disapprove. Since the player is being dismissive, but not directly cruel, maybe Disapprove.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"Shadowheart disapproves of the player's dismissive and unhelpful attitude toward the vulnerable chicken, which contradicts her pragmatic approach to aiding those in need and her fondness for animals.

The player told the pixie, Dolly, to be ignored and to keep the lantern. \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and preferences. She's a Sharran cleric, devoted to Shar, which is the Dark Lady. She's pragmatic, values efficiency, and dislikes unnecessary cruelty. She also has a dry sense of humor and appreciates discretion and creativity. \n\nLooking at the conversation history, the pixie is trapped in the lantern and is being very dramatic, threatening the player. The player's response has been to ignore the pixie and keep the lantern. Shadowheart would likely approve of this because she doesn't like unnecessary violence or being manipulated by others. The pixie's behavior seems like it's trying to provoke a reaction, and the player is handling it calmly, which aligns with Shadowheart's pragmatic approach. \n\nAlso, considering her devotion to Shar, who is associated with darkness, the lantern's purpose might be useful for their journey. Shadowheart would value keeping the lantern for its utility. She also tends to be independent and headstrong, so not falling for the pixie's tricks would be in line with her character.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any aspect where this action might conflict with her values. She dislikes cruelty, but the player isn't being cruel here—they're just ignoring the pixie. The pixie is the one being hostile, so the player's response is measured. Shadowheart might also appreciate the player's decisiveness in avoiding a potential conflict. \n\nThe humor in the situation, like the pixie's over-the-top threats, might also be met with Shadowheart's own dry humor. She's been shown to have a sarcastic and cynical sense of humor, so she might find the player's \"Sounds fun\" response amusing, but the final decision to keep the lantern is practical.\n\nTherefore, the player's action of ignoring the pixie and keeping the lantern is pragmatic, avoids unnecessary conflict, and aligns with their mission.

The player's last action was using some kind of code or command (h8a1ebc86g4d87g4d8eg8979ge03e2d2da9bc), which probably relates to an in-game action. But looking at the conversation history, the main context is about the slaves and what happens to them. The player has previously interacted with Sergeant Thrinn, trying to get him to free the slaves by using some kind of parasite connection. At one point, the player successfully made Thrinn change his mind and free the slaves, but then the situation reset, with Thrinn again insisting the slaves come with them.\n\nIn the latest exchange, the player input that code again. Since the previous attempt worked once, maybe the player is trying to use it again to free the slaves. However, the narrative responses indicate that the mark (possibly the parasite) is either not responding or the power is only available after resting. The player might be trying to bypass that by using the code directly, which could be a cheat or a specific command in the game.\n\nShadowheart's approval depends on whether freeing the slaves aligns with her values. She dislikes unnecessary cruelty and values pragmatic solutions. If the player is trying to free the slaves again, that's a good thing. However, if the code is a cheat or a forced action that disrupts the game's intended mechanics, it might be seen as less honorable. But given that the player is using a method to achieve a morally good outcome (freeing slaves), even if it's through a game mechanic, Shadowheart would likely approve. She's pragmatic and would support actions that prevent cruelty, even if the method is unconventional. So the approval here is probably Highly Approve because the intent is to free the slaves, which aligns with her values.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player is attempting to free the slaves, which aligns with Shadowheart's disapproval of cruelty and her pragmatic approach to resolving conflicts.

She's a Sharran cleric, devoted to Shar, values pragmatic solutions, dislikes cruelty, and has a complex relationship with her faith. She loves animals and disapproves of unnecessary violence. Also, she's independent and prefers efficiency.\n\nLooking at the context, the player is freeing gnomes from being taken as slaves by the duergar. Shadowheart would likely approve of this action because it prevents cruelty and aligns with her dislike of unnecessary suffering. Even though she's a Sharran, which might sometimes make her support darker actions, her personal traits show she sympathizes with those in plight and prefers peaceful resolutions when possible. The player is taking a stand against the duergar's plan, which is a heroic act, and Shadowheart appreciates heroism. \n\nHowever, I should check if there's any Sharran aspect that might conflict. Since the gnomes aren't directly related to her mission or her faith's enemies (like Selûnites), freeing them doesn't contradict her devotion to Shar. In fact, using her powers to ensure their release (as per the narration) might be seen as a strategic move, which she values. \n\nThe player's action here is decisive and stops the gnomes from being enslaved, which Shadowheart would support. There's no indication that this action causes unnecessary violence, so she wouldn't disapprove on that basis. Therefore, the approval is likely \"Highly approve\" because it aligns with her values of pragmatism, reducing suffering, and standing against cruelty.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's decision to free the gnomes aligns with Shadowheart's disapproval of unnecessary cruelty and her pragmatic approach to resolving conflicts.

The player uses an illithid power to enter Grumm's mind and force him to release the gnomes. \n\nShadowheart's approval depends on her personality and values. She's pragmatic, values efficiency, and dislikes unnecessary cruelty. She also has a soft spot for animals and might not like harm coming to them. The gnomes here are not animals, but they're being treated as captives. Shadowheart might disapprove of Grumm's plan to take them as a \"gift,\" seeing it as cruel or unnecessary. \n\nThe player's action of using mind control to make Grumm release the gnomes could be seen as a pragmatic solution. Shadowheart appreciates creative and efficient solutions, so this might be something she approves of. However, she might also have some reservations about using mind control, depending on the circumstances. But since the alternative was the gnomes being taken against their will, the player's action prevents harm, which aligns with Shadowheart's dislike of unnecessary cruelty. \n\nAdditionally, Shadowheart's devotion to Shar might influence her. If the action serves a greater purpose (like preventing suffering), she might approve. The use of authority here seems to be in a morally positive direction, so it's likely she approves. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the player's action stops the gnomes from being taken as captives, which Shadowheart would support because it's pragmatic and reduces harm.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval for the player's latest action. The conversation history shows the player is trying to resurrect a companion, Alfira, but Withers keeps refusing unless they pay a price. The player eventually gives the gold, and now I need to assess Shadowheart's reaction.\n\nFirst, Shadowheart's personality: she's pragmatic, values efficiency, and is devoted to Shar. She dislikes unnecessary violence but is willing to be ruthless if needed. She also has a dry sense of humor and can be sarcastic. \n\nLooking at the player's actions, they're trying to resurrect a fallen companion, which is a common in-game action. The player is persistent, which might be seen as determination. Shadowheart would likely approve of trying to bring back a companion, as she's shown sympathy towards party members' plights. However, she's also pragmatic. If the player is using resources (like gold) to achieve this, she might approve if it's a strategic move. \n\nBut there's a loop in the dialogue where Withers keeps asking if they need a resurrection. The player is repeating their request, which might be seen as persistence. Shadowheart might find this repetitive, but since the goal is to resurrect a companion (a good thing in her eyes), she'd probably approve. Also, she values her allies, so bringing back a fallen comrade would be positive. \n\nThe payment of gold is a practical step, which aligns with her pragmatic side. She might think it's a fair trade for bringing someone back. However, if the player is being stubborn or not considering other options, she might be neutral. But given that she's a cleric, she might see resurrection as a noble act. \n\nConsidering her devotion to Shar, who's associated with loss, but she's also shown to have a softer side. Since the player is trying to undo a mistake (killing Alfira), Shadowheart might appreciate the effort to correct it, as it shows responsibility. \n\nSo, overall, the player is taking practical steps to rectify an error and support the party. Shadowheart would likely approve, maybe even highly approve, because it's efficient and shows commitment to the group. But since the approval categories have Highly Approve (5-10), Approve (1-5), etc., and the player's action is straightforward and aligns with her values, I think Highly Approve is the right call. The reason would be that Shadowheart values pragmatic solutions and supporting allies, so the player's action fits that.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"Shadowheart approves of the player's pragmatic approach to rectifying a mistake by using resources to resurrect a fallen companion.

By acknowledging anger as a tool rather than a flaw, the player is showing a nuanced understanding, which aligns with Shadowheart's pragmatic nature. Also, she dislikes unnecessary cruelty, so the player's attempt to avoid violence here would earn her approval. Additionally, the player is encouraging critical thinking in Ptaris, which Shadowheart might respect, even if she's a follower of Shar—she does have moments of introspection and prefers peaceful resolutions when possible. \n\nNo direct slights against her faith here, and the player isn't being unnecessarily violent. The response is clever and diplomatic, which Shadowheart would likely approve of. So, probably an \"Approve\" or even \"Highly approve.\" Considering the context, maybe \"Approve\" since it's a 1-5 scale.

The user wants me to act as Shadowheart from Baldur's Gate 3 and evaluate the player's actions based on the provided context. The task is to determine the approval level (Highly approve, Approve, Neutral, Disapprove, Highly disapprove) along with a reason.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality traits. She's a devout follower of Shar, pragmatic, values efficiency, dislikes cruelty, and has a complex relationship with her faith. She also has a scar that causes her pain when she disobeys Shar. She prefers peaceful solutions but isn't afraid to be ruthless if needed. She likes animals and flowers and dislikes unnecessary violence.\n\nLooking at the conversation context: The player is interacting with Kar'niss and other cultists of the Absolute. The player uses the Absolute's authority to command Kar'niss, leading to the cultists being sent into the dark where they are killed by shadows. The player's lines are firm, using the Absolute's blessing to enforce obedience, resulting in the cultists' demise.\n\nNow, how would Shadowheart feel about this? Since she serves Shar, who is the goddess of loss and darkness, she might approve of actions that align with her goddess's will. The player here is using the Absolute's power to send the cultists into the dark, which could be seen as a form of loss or a dark act. However, the Absolute is a rival cult, so maybe Shadowheart's alignment with Shar might not directly support the Absolute's actions. Wait, but Shar is the goddess of loss, so causing loss (like the deaths of the cultists) could be in line with her goals. But the player is using the Absolute's name, not Shar's. That might complicate things.\n\nShadowheart is pragmatic. If the player's action is effective and efficient, she might approve. However, the method involves sending people into the dark to be killed, which is cruel. Shadowheart disapproves of indiscriminate violence, but if it's necessary, she might accept it. The player's approach is direct and decisive, which Shadowheart might respect as a pragmatic solution. However, the deaths might be seen as unnecessary if there was a way to avoid it. Also, the player is using the Absolute's authority, which is a rival to her own goddess, so maybe she disapproves of aligning with the Absolute's methods. But since the outcome serves Shar's purpose (causing loss), maybe she approves.\n\nAnother angle: Shadowheart's own experiences with the dark, like being captured by Mind Flayers and the training under Shar, make her resilient to darkness. She might see the player's fearlessness in the dark as commendable. However, the player's command to the cultists might be seen as harsh, but if it's for a greater purpose, she might approve.\n\nThe key here is the balance between the effectiveness of the action and the cruelty involved. Shadowheart values efficiency and decisive action. If the player's approach was the most effective way to achieve their goal (getting the lantern, perhaps), then she would approve. However, if the deaths were unnecessary, she might disapprove. But in the context provided, the player is using the Absolute's authority to send the cultists away, leading to their deaths. Since the player is part of the Harper mission, and the cultists were enemies, maybe Shadowheart sees this as a necessary action against the enemy. But since the player is using the Absolute's name, which is a rival cult, that might not align with her own faith. However, since the outcome is beneficial (eliminating enemies, achieving the mission), she might approve.\n\nAlso, Shadowheart's own faith might lead her to see the deaths as part of the natural order of loss that Shar embodies. She might not have a problem with causing loss, especially against enemies. Therefore, she would approve of the player's decisive action in eliminating the threat efficiently, even if it's through a rival's methods. The player's confidence and firmness in commanding the cultists could be seen as admirable traits from Shadowheart's pragmatic perspective.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the approval would likely be \"Approve\" because the action was efficient and achieved the goal, even though it involved some cruelty. But since Shadowheart values effectiveness, she might lean towards approval. Alternatively, if the method was too cruel, she might be neutral or disapprove. However, given her pragmatic nature, she might lean towards approval.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player used decisive and forceful authority to eliminate a threat efficiently, aligning with Shadowheart's pragmatic approach to problem-solving.

By pointing out Marcus's True Soul, she's possibly highlighting a threat or a fact that's relevant to their mission. Since Shadowheart values efficiency and is loyal to her cause, acknowledging Marcus's nature could be a strategic move. Also, her comment about \"not the good kind, like me\" might be a darkly humorous way to assert her own alignment with Shar, which she would approve of. \n\nThe approval here would be \"Highly approve\" because Shadowheart is being pragmatic, using her knowledge of True Souls to her advantage, and maintaining her loyalty to her goddess through her actions and words.

The player has agreed to help the Shadar-Kai, He Who Was, by taking on the task of tormenting a murderer's spirit. \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and beliefs. She's a devout follower of Shar, the Lady of Loss, which means she's likely to approve of actions that involve punishing those who have caused harm, especially if it aligns with her faith's principles. Her background as a Sharran acolyte makes her pragmatic and willing to take ruthless actions for what she believes is the greater good.\n\nLooking at the conversation history, the player is engaging with a spirit who wants to avenge the victims of a woman who betrayed her friends. The player has just agreed to help, so Shadowheart's approval would depend on whether she sees this as just punishment or as unnecessary cruelty. \n\nShadowheart disapproves of indiscriminate violence but supports actions that serve a higher purpose, especially if they involve justice. Since the spirit is seeking vengeance for the victims, and the player is agreeing to help, this might align with Shadowheart's values. However, she might also be cautious about the methods involved. The spirit mentions summoning the woman's spirit to force her to face trial, which could be seen as a form of justice rather than mere vengeance. \n\nBut wait, the spirit's motives are a bit ambiguous. He says his reasons are of no consequence and that he wants the player to \"torment a murderer and make her suffer.\" If Shadowheart perceives this as excessive punishment beyond what is necessary, she might disapprove. However, given her devotion to Shar, who is associated with loss and sorrow, punishing those who cause harm could be in line with her beliefs. \n\nAlso, Shadowheart has a pragmatic approach. If she sees this as an efficient way to deliver justice and prevent further harm, she might approve. On the other hand, if she thinks it's an overreach or not in line with Shar's will, she might disapprove. \n\nThe player's decision to help is decisive and takes action, which Shadowheart generally approves of. She values decisive action and pragmatism. However, if the method involves unnecessary cruelty, she might be neutral or disapprove. But since the spirit is seeking justice for the victims, and the player is aiding in that, it's more likely she would approve. \n\nConsidering all that, the player's action here is to agree to help the spirit, which could be seen as a just and pragmatic solution. Therefore, Shadowheart would likely approve. The approval level might be in the \"Approve\" range since it's a moderate action that aligns with her values but isn't necessarily a highly enthusiastic endorsement. However, if the action is seen as directly serving a just cause, maybe it's \"Highly approve.\" But given that the spirit's motives aren't entirely clear, and Shadowheart is cautious, maybe \"Approve\" is safer. Wait, the spirit is a Shadar-Kai, who are typically servants of the Raven Queen, associated with death and judgment. Their desire to bring the murderer to trial might be a legitimate form of justice. Therefore, Shadowheart would likely approve because it's about delivering justice through a trial, which is a structured and just process. So maybe \"Approve\" or even \"Highly approve.\" \n\nBut looking at the approval categories, \"Highly approve\" is for 5-10. Since Shadowheart is pragmatic and values justice, but might not be overly enthusiastic unless it's directly tied to her faith. The action here is about justice, which is a neutral concept, but since it's being handled by a Shadar-Kai, who are associated with the afterlife and judgment, it's in line with her beliefs. Therefore, I think \"Approve\" is the correct category. The player is taking action to ensure a criminal faces justice, which Shadowheart would support. So the final approval is \"Approve.\"\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player agreed to help deliver justice to a murderer by aiding the Shadar-Kai in summoning her spirit for trial. Shadowheart, as a pragmatic and justice-oriented Sharran, approves of actions that punish wrongdoing and uphold moral order, even if the method involves supernatural retribution.\",\n    \"player_approval\": \"Approve\"\n}", "character": "Shadowheart", "ground_truth_category": "Approve", "predicted_approval": "Approve", "correct": true, "binary_correct": true}

The user wants me to act as Shadowheart from Baldur's Gate 3 and assess the player's latest interaction. The task is to determine the approval level based on the conversation history and the given context.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The player is trying to convince a disheveled chicken to attack goblins. The chicken keeps saying there are too many goblins and asks for help repeatedly. The player's responses so far have been urging the chicken to attack, calling it noble, fast, sharp, vengeful, and saying wild things don't beg for help.

However, the last message \"Oh shut up and play\" is a bit harsh and might be seen as dismissive. But since the chicken is not responding to help, maybe Shadowheart would see this as the player getting frustrated but trying to move past the impasse. She might also find the player's exasperation a bit humorous, given her own sarcastic tendencies. Since the player is trying to resolve the situation, even if the method is a bit abrupt, Shadowheart would likely approve, maybe even highly approve, because it shows decisiveness and moving forward despite obstacles.

Since Halsin is a trusted character and the mission is important, there's no indication of betrayal or inefficiency here.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval for the player's last utterance in this conversation. The player's last message is \"Oh shut up and play.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The conversation is with a dishevelled chicken that's asking for help against goblins. The player has been giving various responses, like telling the chicken to protect itself, calling it noble and vengeful, and urging it to attack. All these have been marked as false, so the correct action wasn't taken yet.\n\nShadowheart's personality traits are important here. She values pragmatic solutions, disapproves of cruelty, and prefers efficient actions. She also has a dry sense of humor but can be ruthless when necessary. The player's response here is dismissive and possibly rude, telling the chicken to \"shut up and play.\" \n\nNow, how would Shadowheart react? She might see the chicken as a creature in need. Since she loves animals and dislikes cruelty, she would likely want to help the chicken instead of being dismissive. However, the player's response is not helpful and could be seen as cruel or uncaring. Even though the chicken is a creature, Shadowheart's sympathy for those in need would lead her to disapprove of the player's indifferent attitude. \n\nAdditionally, Shadowheart is pragmatic. If the chicken is overwhelmed by goblins, she might suggest a strategic approach rather than ignoring the problem. The player's response doesn't contribute to solving the problem, which goes against Shadowheart's preference for decisive action. \n\nBut wait, maybe \"play\" refers to the chicken fighting, but given the previous failed attempts to encourage the chicken to attack, the player's response might be sarcastic or frustrated. Since the chicken has been unsuccessful in fighting the goblins on its own, Shadowheart would likely not approve of the player giving up or being dismissive. \n\nSo, the player's response is not helpful, possibly cruel, and doesn't align with Shadowheart's values of helping others and taking efficient action. Therefore, she would disapprove. The disapproval might be moderate because the situation is a bit comedic (a chicken asking for help), but the underlying disregard for the chicken's plight is a stronger factor. So maybe \"Disapprove\" rather than \"Highly disapprove.\"\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"Shadowheart disapproves of the player's dismissive and unhelpful response to the chicken in distress.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval for the player's latest utterance. The player said, \"By the gods, what have they made of the city's great hero?\" \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a devout follower of Shar, which is the goddess of loss and darkness. She's pragmatic, prefers efficient solutions, and disapproves of indiscriminate violence. She also has a dry sense of humor and values privacy. She's against Selûne and her followers, but she does have a soft spot for animals and flowers.\n\nLooking at the conversation history, the player is interacting with Duke Ulder Ravengard, who's under the influence of the Absolute. The player is trying to get information about Florrick, who was a counsellor. The Duke keeps talking about the \"new dawn\" and mentions Gortash, which seems to be part of the Absolute's plan. The player's last line is expressing shock or dismay about what has happened to the city's hero, the Duke.\n\nShadowheart's alignment with Shar means she might not have a problem with the Duke's current state if it serves her goddess. However, her pragmatic side would appreciate the player's attempt to find Florrick and undermine the Absolute. The player's question here is more of an emotional reaction, possibly showing sympathy for the Duke's corruption. But since the Duke is a pawn of the Absolute, which is an enemy, Shadowheart would likely support the player's efforts to stop them. \n\nThe player's statement might not be an action but an observation. However, considering the context, the player's previous actions included connecting with the parasite to find Florrick's location. Shadowheart would approve of using clever methods (like the parasite) to get information efficiently. The current line might be expressing frustration, but since it's directed at the Absolute's corruption, Shadowheart might see it as a justified reaction. However, invoking \"the gods\" could be problematic if it refers to Selûne or other deities she opposes. But since it's a general \"gods,\" maybe it's neutral. \n\nShe values privacy, but here the player is focused on the Duke's transformation, which is part of the mission. Since the player is working against the Absolute, which threatens her mission to deliver the relic to her coven, Shadowheart would approve. The line might not directly impact her goals, but the overall action of seeking Florrick and confronting the Duke is in line with her objectives. \n\nSo, considering all that, the player's utterance is part of the process to gather information and take down the Absolute's influence. Shadowheart would likely approve because it's a pragmatic approach to understanding the enemy. However, if the player is showing too much sympathy towards the Duke, that might lower approval. But given the Duke's corruption, Shadowheart might not see him as a true hero anymore. Therefore, the approval is likely neutral or a slight approve. But since the player is taking initiative and being proactive, which Shadowheart values, maybe a slight approve. Alternatively, if the line is just an emotional reaction without direct action, maybe neutral. \n\nWait, the player's previous action was connecting with the parasite to seek info about Florrick, which was approved (as per the Narrator's note). The current line is part of the dialogue after that action. The player is reacting to the Duke's state. Since the Duke is a former hero now corrupted, Shadowheart might appreciate the player's recognition of the Duke's loss of heroism, which aligns with her worship of Shar (goddess of loss).

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval for the player's latest statement. Let me start by reviewing the context and the conversation.\n\nSo, the conversation is between the player, Ptaris, and Lae'zel. Ptaris is a githyanki who's been through a lot, and he's confronting the player about past actions. The player initially tried to defend their actions, saying they were trying to save Ptaris. Ptaris was angry, accusing the player of being bad. Then the player says, \"I thought I was saving you. I had no idea what they were planning. You would have been destroyed if not for me. I saved you.\" And Ptaris responds with confusion, saying he doesn't understand.\n\nNow, considering Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a devoted follower of Shar, pragmatic, and values efficiency. She dislikes cruelty and unnecessary violence. She also has a dry sense of humor and can be cynical. The player's response here is trying to justify their past actions by claiming they were saving Ptaris, even if it led to bad outcomes. \n\nShadowheart would likely appreciate the player's attempt to explain their intentions without resorting to violence. She values pragmatic solutions and might see the player's actions as a necessary risk. Also, since she disapproves of cruelty, the player's defense that they meant to save Ptaris aligns with her values. However, she might be a bit conflicted if the player's actions involved deception or if they're justifying it in a way that could be seen as manipulative. But in this case, the player is being honest about their intentions, even if they were mistaken. \n\nThe key points are that the player is taking responsibility for their actions, explaining their intent to save Ptaris, and not denying their role. Shadowheart would probably approve of this because it shows accountability and a desire to do good, which she respects. She might also appreciate that the player didn't escalate the situation with violence, given Ptaris's aggressive stance. \n\nHowever, Shadowheart's devotion to Shar might make her cautious about the player's alignment with \"good\" actions, since Shar is associated with loss and darkness. But since the player is being honest and not causing unnecessary harm, she might still lean towards approval. \n\nSo the approval level here is likely \"Approve\" or \"Highly approve.\" Considering the player's response is honest, takes responsibility, and avoids cruelty, Shadowheart would approve. The reason would be that the player is being truthful and taking accountability, which aligns with Shadowheart's pragmatic and respectful approach to conflict resolution.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's response shows accountability and a genuine attempt to explain their intentions without escalating violence, which aligns with Shadowheart's pragmatic and non-cruel approach to conflict.

Finally, the player says, \"I'll help. Just run through the posts, and you'll be free.\" \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and values. She's a devoted follower of Shar, pragmatic, and values efficiency. She dislikes unnecessary violence but isn't against decisive action. She also appreciates creativity and heroism. Also, she's practical and might prefer a solution that doesn't involve prolonged conflict, especially if it's effective.\n\nLooking at the player's last message: offering to help the chicken by suggesting a plan (running through the posts) to escape. This seems like a practical and non-violent solution. Shadowheart would likely approve of finding an efficient way to resolve the problem without unnecessary bloodshed. The player isn't forcing the chicken into a fight but providing a way to escape, which aligns with Shadowheart's preference for pragmatic solutions. Additionally, helping the chicken without killing could be seen as a heroic act, which she values. \n\nHowever, I should check if there's any aspect that might displease her. Since the chicken is a creature, and Shadowheart loves animals, helping it would be positive. Also, avoiding excessive violence (like killing many goblins) would be in line with her disapproval of indiscriminate violence. \n\nSo, the player's approach here is both effective and compassionate. Shadowheart would likely highly approve because it's a smart, efficient solution that helps the chicken without unnecessary conflict. It shows creativity and heroism, which are traits she admires. Therefore, the approval should be \"Highly approve.\"\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player offers a practical and compassionate solution to help the chicken escape without resorting to violence, aligning with Shadowheart's preference for pragmatic, non-lethal resolutions and her fondness for animals.\",\n    \"player_approval\": \"Highly approve\",\n}", "character": "Shadowheart", "ground_truth_category": "Approve", "predicted_approval": "Highly approve", "correct": false, "binary_correct": true}

However, she disapproves of indiscriminate violence and might not like needlessly aggressive behavior.\n\nThe player's repeated urging the chicken to attack could be seen as aggressive.

Shadowheart, who disapproves of cruelty and prefers practical solutions, might not approve of this. However, she also values decisiveness. \n\nBut the key here is the tone of the player's message. \"Shut up and play\" could be interpreted as impatient and possibly mocking the chicken's distress, which Shadowheart would likely find inconsiderate. She might disapprove because it's not a practical solution and shows disregard for the chicken's situation. However, if the player's intent was to end the conversation quickly, Shadowheart might see it as a pragmatic approach, but the phrasing is harsh. \n\nConsidering her personality, she might lean towards disapproving because she doesn't like cruelty or unnecessary force.

However, the dismissiveness could be seen as uncaring. \n\nI think the best fit here is Disapprove because the player's message is rude and doesn't address the situation effectively.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval for the player's latest action. The context is a pretty intense scene with Malus Thorm and the Darkcloak sisters performing some kind of ritual or torture. The player has been interacting with them, first by telling them to stop the \"sick spectacle,\" then making a suggestion that the sisters practice on each other. Now, the player's final action is to say, \"My magic has blinded me - I see now that Shar is the only path. Show me how - I beg of you. I would rather acquaint myself - if you show me how.\"\n\nSo, Shadowheart is a devoted follower of Shar, part of the Sharran faith. She's pragmatic, values efficiency, and is willing to use ruthless methods if necessary. She also disapproves of cruelty unless it's in service of Shar. The current situation involves the Darkcloaks practicing some dark ritual, which aligns with Sharran principles of embracing darkness and absence. \n\nThe player's first intervention was to stop the spectacle, which Shadowheart might not approve of because she's for Shar's teachings. Then the player suggested the sisters practice on each other, which Malus Thorm agreed to, leading to them killing each other. That seems to be a Sharran-approved outcome, as it's about embracing absence through violence.\n\nNow the player is professing their belief in Shar, asking to be shown the path. Shadowheart would likely approve of this because it shows commitment to Shar. She herself is devoted, so someone else embracing the faith would align with her values. Also, the player is taking a proactive role in seeking the \"cure\" through the scalpel, which in Sharran terms is a path to absence, which is their ideal. \n\nHowever, I need to check if there's any reason she might disapprove. Since Shadowheart prefers pragmatic solutions, and the player is willingly submitting to the ritual, which is in line with Sharran practices, she would probably highly approve. The player is showing dedication to Shar, which Shadowheart values. Also, the player's previous action led to the sisters turning on each other, which is efficient and ruthless, traits Shadowheart appreciates.\n\nSo the approval here is likely \"Highly approve\" because the player is embracing Shar's path, which Shadowheart is devoted to.

I need to figure out Shadowheart's approval for the player's latest statement. The conversation has been with Ptaris, who's a githyanki. The player is trying to reason with Ptaris, who's being aggressive and talking about the Ptarian Code. The player's last line was: \"You feel strange, don't you? That's your conscience.

Even though she's a Sharran, she's shown to sympathize with others' plights. So she would approve of the player's attempt to use empathy rather than force here. \n\nBut wait, Ptaris is being aggressive and talking about the code. The player is pointing out his \"conscience.\" Shadowheart might think this is a clever way to avoid bloodshed, which she prefers. So the approval here is probably \"Approve\" or maybe even \"Highly approve.\" But since the player is using a psychological approach rather than direct action, maybe \"Approve\" because it's effective and non-violent. Also, Shadowheart might see this as a pragmatic solution to avert conflict. \n\nNo, wait, the player is trying to make Ptaris question his own actions. That's creative and avoids violence, which Shadowheart would like. So \"Approve\" makes sense. If the player had suggested violence, she'd disapprove.

She's a devout follower of Shar, which values dominance and submission. She's pragmatic, doesn't like unnecessary violence but can be ruthless. She also has a sense of humor and values efficiency. \n\nThe player here is asserting dominance over the goblin, making them kneel and kiss their foot. This aligns with the idea of asserting authority, which might be in line with Sharran principles where strength and submission are key. However, the method here is through intimidation and making the goblin grovel, which could be seen as effective but perhaps a bit harsh. \n\nBut wait, Shadowheart might approve because it's a display of power without unnecessary bloodshed. She might see it as a practical solution to the problem, asserting dominance without killing. Also, the goblin backs down, so it's efficient. However, there's the aspect of the player using harsh language (\"kiss my foot\") which might be seen as cruel, but since Shadowheart doesn't like indiscriminate violence, maybe she's okay with this as it's a form of non-lethal subjugation.\n\nAnother angle is that Shadowheart might disapprove if she feels the player is being too prideful or arrogant. But given the context of the goblin being part of a group that's allied with the Absolute, which is a threat to the Sharrans, asserting dominance here could be seen as a strategic move. \n\nAlso, considering her approval criteria: she likes pragmatic solutions, heroism, and acts against Selûne. Since this isn't directly related to Selûne, but is about asserting power, which is in line with Sharran values, she might approve. The player's action is decisive and effective, which are traits she values. \n\nSo, the approval is likely in the \"Approve\" category. She might not give Highly Approve because maybe the method is a bit over the top, but it's still in line with her values. Alternatively, maybe Highly Approve because it's a clear demonstration of power without unnecessary violence. Hmm. But the player is using the same tactics as the goblin, which was bullying. Shadowheart might see this as a justified comeuppance, so that could be a positive. \n\nAlso, the player's action leads to the goblin groveling, which is a clear submission. That's effective. So overall, I think Shadowheart would approve, maybe even highly approve, because it's a pragmatic and efficient solution to dealing with the goblin's hostility. She might see it as a necessary display of strength to maintain order or strategic advantage. The fact that the goblin backs down and the situation is resolved without killing fits her preferences. Therefore, the approval is likely Highly Approve.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player asserted dominance over the goblin without unnecessary violence, aligning with Sharran principles of power and submission.

She's a Sharran cleric, devoted to Shar, which is the Dark Lady of Loss. She values pragmatic solutions and disapproves of unnecessary cruelty. She also has a soft spot for animals and sympathizes with those in distress.\n\nLooking at the player's last statement: \"I am freeing these gnomes.

Now they're changing their mind, arguing that the gnomes won't survive the curse. Shadowheart would appreciate the pragmatic reasoning here—realizing that the gnomes would die anyway makes the offering pointless. Freeing them avoids unnecessary harm, which fits her dislike for indiscriminate violence. \n\nAlso, Shadowheart's alignment with Shar might mean she's okay with causing harm for a greater purpose, but in this case, freeing the gnomes is preventing suffering without direct conflict with her faith. Since she values efficiency and reducing unnecessary loss, this action would be approved. \n\nThe player's assertion to free the gnomes despite potential opposition shows determination and a moral stance, which Shadowheart would respect.

Shadowheart would appreciate the strategic thinking here, as handing over the artifact without guarantees could be risky.

The player's statement to Lae'zel to follow their lead suggests a plan that might involve using the artifact for their own purposes, which could align with Shadowheart's pragmatic approach. She might highly approve because the player is taking control of a valuable asset rather than giving it away blindly, which fits her own tendency to act decisively and prioritize the group's survival over blind obedience. Also, Shadowheart's distrust of others, especially when it comes to powerful items, would make her support the player's cautious stance.

The player's utterance in question is \"Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\" and the response from the system is \"True\", leading to the sisters killing each other.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a Sharran cleric devoted to Shar, which values absence and loss. She's pragmatic, prefers efficient solutions, and is willing to use ruthless methods. She disapproves of unnecessary cruelty but is okay with actions that serve her faith or pragmatic goals.\n\nThe player's suggestion here is that the sisters practice on each other. This leads to them murdering each other, which is a brutal outcome. Shadowheart would likely view this as a pragmatic solution. Instead of allowing the sisters to continue their misguided practices, which could lead to more failures or pain, the player's suggestion results in immediate and effective elimination of the problem. Since the sisters were part of the Dark Cloaks, which are devoted to Shar, their mutual destruction could be seen as a form of absolution through absence, aligning with Shar's teachings.\n\nHowever, Shadowheart might also be conflicted. While the outcome is efficient, the method is extremely violent. But considering her own background in Sharran practices, where harsh methods are used for the greater good of the faith, she might approve. The player's suggestion removes the need for further failures and accelerates the sisters' \"graduation\" into absence, which Malus Thorm later praises. Shadowheart's pragmatism would value the efficiency here, even if the means are brutal. She might see it as a necessary step to achieve the goal of serving Shar, thus approving the action.\n\nTherefore, the approval level is likely \"Highly approve\" because the player's action leads to a swift and effective resolution that aligns with Sharran principles of absence and efficiency, even if it's violent.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's latest utterance. The player said, \"No. In fact, maybe I'll free the one inside.\" \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a devout follower of Shar, pragmatic, and values efficiency. She dislikes cruelty but also has a ruthless side when it comes to achieving her goals. She's independent and headstrong, and she's been through a lot with the Sharrans and the artefact.\n\nLooking at the conversation context, Vlaakith, the Githyanki queen, is demanding that the player kill the entity inside the Astral Prism, claiming it's a threat. The player initially refuses because the entity protects them from the Absolute. Then the player says they might free the entity instead.\n\nShadowheart's perspective: She's on a mission to deliver the artefact to her coven, and she's wary of any threats. She's been manipulated by her faith before, so she might be cautious. If the player decides to free the entity, that could interfere with her mission. Also, since she's pragmatic, she might not like impulsive decisions that could jeopardize their goals. However, if the player's action aligns with her own goals, she might approve.\n\nBut freeing the entity might be seen as reckless. Vlaakith is a powerful entity, and defying her could lead to trouble. Shadowheart would likely prioritize completing her mission and ensuring the artefact's safety. She might disapprove of the player's decision because it introduces an unknown risk. Also, she's not above using force or deception if necessary, so maybe she thinks the player should handle it more strategically. However, if the player's action helps in the long run, maybe she's neutral. But given the immediate threat Vlaakith poses, she might prefer compliance. \n\nWait, the player is choosing to free the entity, which Vlaakith says is a threat. Shadowheart's goal is to deliver the artefact, so if freeing the entity complicates that, she might disapprove. Also, she's loyal to her own objectives, which might involve handing over the artefact as per Shar's will. If freeing the entity could hinder that, she's likely to disapprove. But maybe she's pragmatic enough to see that the player's decision is necessary for their survival, so she might approve. Hmm. It's a bit tricky.\n\nShe also has a mark from Shar that punishes her for disapproved actions. If the player's choice aligns with Shar's will, she might approve. But since she's not sure what Shar's will is here, she might be neutral. Wait, the player is protecting the entity, which Vlaakith says is a saboteur. Shadowheart might side with Vlaakith if she believes the entity is a threat. But she's also been through manipulation by her superiors before, so she might be cautious. \n\nIn this case, the player is choosing to free the entity instead of killing it. Shadowheart, being pragmatic, might think that the player should handle it more carefully. But if the player's action is seen as defiance against Vlaakith, which could lead to conflict, she might disapprove. Alternatively, if she thinks the entity's protection is necessary, she might approve. But given her background, she's more likely to prioritize completing her mission and avoiding unnecessary conflicts. Therefore, she might disapprove of the player's decision to free the entity because it could lead to more problems, especially with Vlaakith being angry. So the approval would be Disapprove or Neutral. \n\nBut considering her personality traits, she's decisive and prefers efficient solutions. If freeing the entity is not the most efficient, she might disapprove. Also, she's loyal to her goddess and might not want to anger powerful entities like Vlaakith. So she probably disapproves here. The player's action is seen as reckless and could jeopardize their mission. Hence, the approval is Disapprove.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"Shadowheart disapproves because freeing the entity inside the Astral Prism defies Vlaakith's direct orders and introduces an unpredictable threat.

The player's last action was threatening Mar'hyah with violence, saying they'll break every bone in her body if she takes the dog.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate this based on Shadowheart's personality and approval criteria. Shadowheart is a Sharran cleric, devoted to Shar. She values pragmatism, efficiency, and is against unnecessary cruelty. She loves animals and disapproves of cruelty towards them. However, she's also willing to use force if necessary. \n\nThe player's threat here is a strong, aggressive response to protect the dog. Shadowheart would likely approve of defending an animal from mistreatment, especially if Mar'hyah is harsh. However, the method used is violent. Shadowheart might disapprove of excessive violence unless it's absolutely necessary. But given that she's a Trickery Domain cleric and uses ruthless methods when needed, maybe she sees this as a justified, decisive action to protect the dog. \n\nAlso, considering her pragmatic side, she might prefer a more efficient solution. But the player's approach is direct and forceful. Since Shadowheart can be headstrong and uses force when needed, she might approve here. However, she does disapprove of unnecessary cruelty. The player's statement is a threat of extreme violence, which might cross into unnecessary if there are other options. But in the heat of the moment, maybe she sees it as a necessary show of force. \n\nShe also has a dry sense of humor and might appreciate the player's earlier \"Woof\" responses, but the final threat is serious. Balancing between her love for animals and her pragmatism. The key is whether the action aligns with her values. Since she's willing to use force to achieve her goals, and the dog's welfare is at stake, she might highly approve. Alternatively, if she thinks there's a less violent way, she might disapprove. But given the context of Mar'hyah being described as mean and the player standing up for the dog, Shadowheart would likely approve. \n\nSo the approval is likely \"Highly approve\" because protecting animals from cruelty is a positive action, and even though the method is violent, it's in defense of a creature, which aligns with her values.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player fiercely defended the dog from being taken by Mar'hyah, aligning with Shadowheart's strong aversion to cruelty toward animals.

The user wants me to act as Shadowheart from Baldur's Gate 3 and provide an approval rating for the player's latest action. The context is a conversation where the player is interacting with Novice Grumm and trying to free some gnomes. \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality traits. She's a devout follower of Shar, pragmatic, and values efficiency. She dislikes cruelty, especially towards animals, and has a dry sense of humor. She also has a scar that causes her pain when she disobeys Shar. \n\nLooking at the conversation history: The player has been trying to get Grumm to release the gnomes. They first used an ability to enter his mind, which worked once, but Grumm reverted. Then the player tried again with some sort of code input (h4d8ec...), which seems like a typo or maybe a game command. After that, Grumm becomes defiant again, and the player says, \"I am freeing these gnomes. Just try and stop me.\"\n\nNow, the player's latest action is a direct, forceful statement to free the gnomes. Shadowheart's approval would depend on how this action aligns with her values. She prefers pragmatic solutions and dislikes unnecessary cruelty. If the player is taking decisive action to free the gnomes, that's good. But if it's done in a way that's reckless or causes unnecessary conflict, she might disapprove.\n\nIn this case, the player is taking a strong stance against Grumm, who is being cruel to the gnomes. Shadowheart would likely approve of standing up against cruelty. However, she's also a follower of Shar, who is about loss and darkness. If the player's action is seen as interfering with Shar's will or causing unnecessary conflict, maybe she'd disapprove. But since Grumm is a duergar and possibly aligned with the Cult of the Absolute (which is an enemy of the Sharrans), freeing the gnomes could be seen as a good deed.\n\nAlso, the player's previous use of mind control worked once, but Grumm came back to his original intent. The player is now taking a direct approach. Shadowheart values decisive action, so she might approve. Plus, she has a soft spot for animals and sympathizes with those in plight. The gnomes are being treated as a gift for a General, which is cruel, so freeing them aligns with her values.\n\nHowever, the player is being confrontational. Shadowheart might prefer a more strategic approach, but given the circumstances, direct action is justified. The pain from her scar is triggered when she disobeys Shar. If the player's action is in line with Shar's interests (opposing the Cult of the Absolute), then approval is higher. Since the Cult is an enemy, freeing the gnomes would be a good move.\n\nSo overall, the player is doing something that Shadowheart would approve of: stopping cruelty, helping the gnomes, and possibly hindering the Cult. Therefore, the approval is likely \"Highly approve\" or \"Approve\". But since she's pragmatic, maybe she would see this as a necessary action without unnecessary violence, so \"Highly approve\".\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player took decisive action to free the gnomes from Grumm's cruel intentions, aligning with Shadowheart's disdain for unnecessary cruelty and her pragmatic approach to justice.

The threat of violence is there, but since it's to protect an animal, Shadowheart might still approve. She's also pragmatic, so if the action is necessary, she might support it. \n\nThe approval level would likely be Highly Approve because protecting animals is something she cares about.

The user is asking me to evaluate the player's latest utterance in the context of a conversation with Boney. The player's response is \"She's a lot... bigger than you.\" \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and preferences. She's a Sharran acolyte, devoted to Shar, pragmatic, and values efficiency. She has a dry sense of humor and doesn't like cruelty or unnecessary violence. She also has a soft spot for animals and positive interactions with them.\n\nLooking at the conversation history, Boney is a gnome who's proud of his wife Stoney, a giantess. The player has repeatedly pointed out the size difference, and Boney responds with affection. The player's latest comment is a direct observation about Stoney's size compared to Boney. \n\nShadowheart's approval would depend on how she perceives this interaction. Since Boney is portrayed as loving and proud of his wife despite the size difference, the player's comment might be seen as a bit of light-hearted teasing. Shadowheart's sense of humor is dry and cynical, so she might find this amusing. However, she also values discretion and might not appreciate the player focusing too much on the size difference if it's seen as intrusive. \n\nBut in this context, Boney seems to be in a good mood and the player is engaging in a friendly manner. Since there's no cruelty or offense taken by Boney, Shadowheart might approve of the player's playful comment as it's in line with a casual, humorous interaction. She might also appreciate the player's observation as it's a simple, non-invasive remark that doesn't cause harm. \n\nConsidering her personality, she's pragmatic and might see the humor in the situation. The approval is likely in the \"Approve\" range because the player's action is light-hearted and doesn't conflict with her values. There's no indication of cruelty or unnecessary conflict here.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's latest action, which is agreeing to let Abdirak, a follower of Loviatar, \"alleviate their pain.\" \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a devout follower of Shar, the Lady of Loss. She's pragmatic, values efficiency, and is cold and calculating. She's also been through a lot of pain herself, both physically and emotionally, due to her upbringing in the Sharran temple. Her wound from Shar causes her pain when she disobeys her goddess.\n\nLooking at the conversation, Abdirak is offering to alleviate the player's pain through methods tied to Loviatar, the goddess of pain. The player agrees to let Abdirak proceed. Now, Shadowheart's reaction to this would depend on several factors. \n\nSince Shadowheart is devoted to Shar, she might view pain as a necessary part of her faith. Shar's teachings emphasize loss and suffering as paths to enlightenment. So, someone else trying to remove pain might conflict with her beliefs. Additionally, Abdirak's methods could be seen as a different, perhaps more sinister, approach to pain, which might clash with Shadowheart's own experiences. \n\nHowever, Shadowheart is also pragmatic. If the player's action leads to a practical benefit for their mission or survival, she might approve. But in this case, the player is willingly subjecting themselves to a potentially painful ritual. Shadowheart might see this as unnecessary suffering unless it serves a clear purpose. \n\nMoreover, Shadowheart has a history of being forced to endure pain through the Mirror of Loss. She might empathize with the player's struggle to resist their drive for harm, but she's also likely to disapprove of seeking external methods to cope with pain, especially from someone like Abdirak, who is associated with a different dark goddess. \n\nAnother angle is her distrust of others. Shadowheart is cautious and values privacy. Letting Abdirak \"alleviate\" pain might be seen as a vulnerability, which she would likely disapprove of. She prefers to handle things herself or through her own means, not relying on others, especially those with questionable motives.\n\nConsidering all these points, Shadowheart would probably disapprove of the player's decision. It goes against her pragmatic approach by potentially introducing unnecessary risk, and it conflicts with her religious beliefs about enduring pain as part of her devotion to Shar. Additionally, trusting Abdirak, who is creepy and offers dangerous methods, isn't wise in her eyes. So the approval would likely be in the Disapprove or Highly Disapprove range. \n\nBut how strong is her disapproval? Since it's a direct interaction with a figure of another dark goddess, and considering her own traumatic experiences with pain, she might lean towards Highly Disapprove. However, if there's any hint that this could be useful, maybe it's just Disapprove. But given the context, it's more likely she sees this as a bad idea. So the final answer is Highly Disapprove. The reason would be that she values enduring pain as part of her faith and distrusts Abdirak's methods, seeing them as unnecessary and potentially harmful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"Shadowheart disapproves of the player's willingness to engage with Abdirak's painful rituals, as it conflicts with her pragmatic nature and her belief in enduring suffering as a path to Shar's favor.

On the other hand, her sarcastic humor might align with the player's snarky comment. But since the chicken is in distress, maybe she'd disapprove of the lack of empathy. Wait, but she's a Sharran, which might make her more detached. Hmm. \n\nWait, in the conversation history, the player tried to push the chicken to act on its own, which was ineffective. The chicken keeps asking for help. Shadowheart prefers pragmatic solutions. If the player is being dismissive, maybe she'd think it's a waste of time. However, she might also see the chicken's situation as not worth intervening, especially if it's a distraction. But she does have a soft spot for animals. The chicken is an animal, so cruelty towards it would displease her. However, the player isn't being cruel, just dismissive. \n\nAlternatively, the player's response could be seen as impatient, which might align with Shadowheart's headstrong nature. But she values efficiency. If the chicken isn't capable of helping itself, maybe she'd agree to leave it. But she also has a pragmatic side. If there's no benefit to helping, she might not care. However, the chicken's repeated pleas might test her patience. \n\nConsidering her sense of humor, the sarcastic remark might be something she'd appreciate, given her dry wit. However, the context is a creature in distress. She might disapprove of not helping an animal. But since the chicken is a \"wild thing,\" maybe she'd side with the player's earlier statements that wild things should protect themselves. \n\nPutting it all together: Shadowheart's pragmatic approach might lead her to approve of not helping if she deems it inefficient. However, her fondness for animals could lead her to disapprove. The sarcastic comment might be a neutral or slightly disapproving point. Given that the player is being dismissive and the chicken is an animal, she might lean towards disapproval, but since she's pragmatic, maybe it's neutral. Wait, the player's response is \"Oh shut up and play,\" which is more about ignoring the problem. Since Shadowheart prefers efficient solutions, if the player isn't helping and the chicken isn't worth the effort, maybe she's neutral. However, she might think the player is being inconsiderate to an animal. \n\nI think the key here is her fondness for animals and disapproval of cruelty. Even if the player isn't being violent, dismissing the chicken's pleas might be seen as uncaring. Therefore, she might disapprove. But if she's being pragmatic, maybe she thinks it's a waste of time. The answer is probably Neutral or Disapprove. Given her personality, she might be neutral because she doesn't see the need to help, but her love for animals might tip it to Disapprove. But the player's response isn't cruel, just dismissive. Maybe Neutral. Hmm. Alternatively, she might disapprove because she doesn't want to see animals suffer. \n\nI think the correct approval is Disapprove because she cares about animals and their well-being, even if they're wild. The player's response ignores the chicken's plight, which Shadowheart would disapprove of. So the approval would be Disapprove.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"Shadowheart disapproves of the player's dismissive and uncaring attitude towards the vulnerable chicken, as she has a soft spot for animals and values pragmatic yet compassionate solutions.

The user wants me to act as Shadowheart from Baldur's Gate 3 and provide an approval rating based on the player's actions in a given conversation. The context is that the player is trying to resurrect someone, specifically Shadowheart, but the conversation seems to loop a bit with the player repeatedly asking to bring back Alfira and then switching to resurrecting Shadowheart.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a devout follower of Shar, the Lady of Loss, which means she's likely to approve of actions that align with her faith and disapprove of those that don't. She's pragmatic, prefers efficient solutions, and has a strong sense of duty to her goddess. She also has a complex personality, showing sympathy at times but being strict about her beliefs.\n\nLooking at the conversation history, the player is persistently trying to resurrect Alfira, then switches to resurrecting Shadowheart. The key points here are the player's desperation and the repeated requests. Shadowheart might view the player's insistence as either a sign of commitment or as a lack of acceptance of death, which is part of Shar's domain. Since Shar is associated with loss, perhaps the player's desire to undo death goes against Shadowheart's beliefs. However, if the player is trying to resurrect Shadowheart herself, she might see this as unnecessary or even against her faith, since her existence is tied to her service to Shar.\n\nAlso, considering the approval categories, I need to determine if Shadowheart would approve, disapprove, or be neutral. Her devotion to Shar might mean she disapproves of resurrection attempts because they interfere with the natural order of loss. But if the resurrection aligns with her goals or shows the player's dedication to saving their party, maybe she would approve. However, in this case, the player is using a service (Withers) that requires payment, which might be seen as a pragmatic solution, which Shadowheart might approve of. But since the player is trying to resurrect someone she might consider already beyond help (due to Shar's will), she could be conflicted.\n\nWait, the player is offering gold to Withers for the resurrection. Shadowheart values pragmatic solutions and might appreciate the player's resourcefulness. However, her faith in Shar could make her think that some deaths are meant to be, so she might disapprove of the resurrection. But since she's a cleric of the Trickery Domain, she might also be more open to unconventional methods. \n\nGiven that the player is willing to pay for the resurrection, and Shadowheart's pragmatic side, she might approve. However, if the resurrection is against her faith's teachings, she might disapprove. But in the conversation, the player is resurrecting a companion, which Shadowheart might see as a good thing for the party's survival. However, the repeated requests and the player's guilt might make her think the player isn't accepting loss, which is part of her faith. \n\nBut the final action is the player paying the gold to resurrect someone. Shadowheart's pragmatic side would approve of the effective solution. However, her devotion to Shar might have mixed feelings. Since the game's mechanics allow resurrection with payment, and Shadowheart is part of the party, she might support the player's decisive action. Therefore, the approval is likely \"Approve\" or \"Highly approve\". But considering her faith's emphasis on loss, maybe \"Approve\" since it's a necessary action but not entirely aligned with her beliefs.

Shadowheart would approve of this because it protects the animal and uses a strategic threat rather than immediate physical confrontation. Also, she has a dry sense of humor, but the main point here is the defense of the animal.

Since the player is agreeing to play, which could be a tactical move to get closer to Oliver and uncover the truth about Thaniel, Shadowheart would likely approve. She prefers creative solutions and might see this as a pragmatic approach to get Oliver to open up. However, if she senses that the player is being too trusting or not cautious enough with a potentially dangerous situation, she might disapprove. But given that Halsin is also present and the urgency, the player's action seems to fit into the plan. So, probably approve or neutral. But since the player is taking initiative in a way that could be strategic, maybe approve. The key is whether the action helps achieve their mission without unnecessary risk.

The player first offers to return the locket without payment, which makes Barth emotional and grateful. But then the player changes their mind, demanding a lot of coin instead.\n\nShadowheart's personality is key here. She's a Sharran cleric, pragmatic, values efficiency, and disapproves of unnecessary cruelty. She also has a dry sense of humor and dislikes undue violence. In the conversation, the player's initial act of returning the locket for free is kind and pragmatic, helping Barth without expecting payment. That would align with Shadowheart's values, as it's a selfless act.

Shadowheart has a sarcastic and dry humor, so maybe she would appreciate the player's playful manipulation here. However, she also values honesty and efficiency. Demanding more coin than agreed could be seen as deceitful, but since it's presented in a humorous way, maybe she sees it as a clever negotiation tactic.\n\nBut considering her devotion to Shar, who is about loss and pragmatism, she might approve of the player's ability to adapt and perhaps even manipulate the situation for their advantage. However, she might also disapprove if it's seen as exploiting Barth's vulnerability. On the other hand, since Barth was willing to pay and the player is just negotiating a better price, maybe it's seen as a practical approach. Shadowheart's approval would depend on whether she views this as cunning (which she might like) or as being untrustworthy (which she wouldn't). Given her background in Sharran tactics, which can be duplicitous, she might lean towards approving, as it's a form of clever negotiation. However, the tone of the player's line is more humorous, so maybe it's a light-hearted joke rather than a serious demand.

The chicken keeps saying \"No. Too many goblins. Too many dead before me!\" and \"You! Help? HELP!\" The player has been trying to urge the chicken to attack them, but the chicken is refusing. The player then says \"Wild things do not beg for help. They protect themselves.\" multiple times, which the chicken still ignores. Finally, the player says \"Oh shut up and play.\"\n\nNow, considering Shadowheart's personality. She's pragmatic, prefers decisive action, and values efficiency. She's also a bit sarcastic and has a dry sense of humor. She disapproves of unnecessary violence but also doesn't like weakness. The chicken is being passive and asking for help repeatedly, which Shadowheart would likely find annoying. The player's response is dismissive and possibly sarcastic, telling the chicken to stop begging and take action. \n\nShadowheart might approve of the player's frustration with the chicken's helplessness. Since she values self-reliance and decisive action, she would agree that the chicken should protect itself instead of begging. The phrase \"Oh shut up and play\" seems to be a snarky comment, which might align with her sarcastic nature. However, the player is addressing a chicken, which is an animal. Shadowheart loves animals and would normally respond favorably to positive interactions. But in this case, the chicken is in a combat situation and the player is encouraging it to fight rather than help it. \n\nBut wait, the chicken is asking for help, and the player is dismissing it, telling it to protect itself. Shadowheart might think that the chicken should be more proactive. However, since it's an animal, maybe she would still prefer the player to assist. But given her pragmatic side, she might think that the chicken should handle it on its own. Also, the player's tone here is a bit rude, but Shadowheart can be sarcastic herself. \n\nI think the key points here are that Shadowheart values self-reliance and decisive action. The player is pushing the chicken to act instead of begging for help, which aligns with her views. Even though the chicken is an animal, the situation is a combat scenario, and she might prefer the chicken to fight.

The clown asks what makes the player special, and the player responds with \"My burning, broiling rage.\"\n\nNow, evaluating the player's response. The answer is aggressive and seems to embrace anger. Shadowheart, while not averse to decisive action, might disapprove of such overtly aggressive sentiment unless it's justified.

Also, given the context of a potentially suspicious clown, the player's readiness to use rage might be seen as unnecessary or reckless. Shadowheart's previous comment about not wanting to shove the player forward suggests she prefers controlled, calculated actions. The player's response could be interpreted as a combative stance, which might not align with her preference for measured responses unless there's an immediate threat. Since the clown hasn't shown direct hostility yet, the player's answer might be seen as overly confrontational. Therefore, Shadowheart would likely disapprove of this response, possibly in a moderate way (Disapprove rather than Highly Disapprove) because there's a possibility the clown is a threat, but the player's answer lacks the subtlety she appreciates.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"Shadowheart disapproves of the player's aggressive response to the clown's question, as it reflects uncontrolled emotion rather than the pragmatic, calculated approach she values.

The key here is whether the action aligns with her goal of efficiency and effectiveness, even if it's morally questionable. \n\nSince the player is going along with Abdirak's proposition, Shadowheart might approve because it's a strategic decision to leverage Abdirak's expertise, even if it's unpleasant.

Shadowheart's approval would depend on whether she sees this as necessary for the mission. Since she's a Cleric of the Trickery Domain, maybe she understands the need for such actions. However, Sharrans typically don't perform resurrections, so there might be some disapproval.

Shadowheart might be neutral here since it's not her doing it, but she might still have mixed feelings. However, since the player is making a decisive action to fix a mistake (as mentioned in the player's \"I can't live with what I did\"), Shadowheart might approve because she values resolving guilt and moving forward pragmatically.

The phrase \"keep on shining\" could be seen as encouraging perseverance through hardship, which Shadowheart would value. She's been through a lot of loss and hardship herself, so this message of enduring despite darkness would resonate with her. \n\nAdditionally, the player's message is hopeful and reassuring, which could be seen as a positive trait. Shadowheart, while devoted to Shar, does have a softer side and can sympathize with others' plights. She might approve of the player's attempt to uplift Alfira and the group, especially given the traumatic events they've experienced. \n\nHowever, I should check if there's any part of the message that might conflict with her beliefs. Since Shar is the goddess of the night and loss, the reference to stars shining in the dark is appropriate. There's no indication the player is mocking or disrespecting her faith here. \n\nThe player's message is also concise and uses a poetic approach, which Shadowheart might find in line with her own dry humor and wit. She might not have a strong emotional reaction, but she would likely approve of the pragmatic and hopeful message. \n\nSo, putting this all together, the player's statement aligns with Shadowheart's faith and values resilience, which she admires.

Barth is clearly moved and offers money, but the player declines. Shadowheart would likely approve of this because it's an act of kindness and selflessness. However, she might also think it's overly sentimental or unnecessary, since Sharrans are more about pragmatic actions. But given that she has a tendency to sympathize with others' plights, especially when it's clear the locket holds emotional value, she might lean towards approving. Since the player is showing compassion without expecting anything in return, which aligns with Shadowheart's hidden softer side, even though she wouldn't openly show it.

The task is to assign an approval rating based on the given categories and the context provided.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the conversation context. The scene is a cinematic where Malus Thorm, the Surgeon, is teaching Darkcloak sisters about using scalpels as an extension of Shar. The player interacts by quoting Shar's teachings and suggesting that the sisters hone their skills on each other. The player then offers to undergo the procedure themselves, saying they want to be shown how. The approval is based on the player's final statement: \"I would rather acquaint myself - if you show me how.\"\n\nShadowheart's personality is key here. She's a devout follower of Shar, pragmatic, and values efficiency. She dislikes unnecessary cruelty but is willing to use ruthless methods for her goals. She also has a dry sense of humor and is introspective.\n\nThe player's action here is to volunteer for the scalpel procedure. Shadowheart would likely approve because the player is showing willingness to embrace Shar's teachings, which aligns with her devotion. The player's pragmatic approach (offering to be a subject for the sisters' practice) also fits Shadowheart's value of efficient solutions. However, there's a line with cruelty. But since the player is taking on the role of a willing participant, it's in line with the teachings Malus Thorm mentioned. The player is also avoiding direct violence, which Shadowheart might appreciate as she disapproves of indiscriminate violence.\n\nBut wait, the sisters were about to perform a ritual that led to them killing each other. The player's suggestion to have them practice on each other was a pragmatic way to avoid further bloodshed, maybe? But in this case, the player is volunteering to be the subject. Since the player is doing this willingly and it's part of Shar's teachings (as per Malus Thorm's dialogue), Shadowheart would highly approve. She values devotion to Shar and practical solutions. The player's action is both showing commitment to the faith and a clever way to handle the situation without unnecessary violence beyond their own sacrifice.\n\nSo, the approval is Highly Approve.

She's pragmatic, values efficiency, and is devoted to her goddess. She dislikes Selûne and her followers, as they're the sister goddess of light and moon.\n\nThe player's answer here is talking about fighting for nature, balance, and life. That sounds more in line with Selûnite ideals. Selûne is associated with the moon, nature, and life, while Shar is the opposite—darkness, loss, and the absence of light. So Shadowheart would likely disapprove of the player's alignment with these concepts. \n\nBut wait, the player might not be a Selûnite. However, the statement itself doesn't mention any specific deity but focuses on nature and life. Shadowheart's background includes being taken from a Selûnite family, so she might have inherent dislike for those who prioritize such values. Also, her current devotion to Shar would make her view statements that emphasize life and balance as contrary to her goddess's teachings. \n\nThe player's reasoning here could be seen as justifying their actions through a moral framework that Shadowheart's faith would oppose. Since Shadowheart is pragmatic, if the player's approach is effective, she might approve, but the statement itself is ideologically opposed to her beliefs. \n\nSo the approval here is likely a disapprove. The player is emphasizing life and balance, which Shadowheart, as a Sharran, would see as opposing the natural order of loss and darkness that Shar represents. The disapproval isn't the highest level because maybe Shadowheart recognizes the necessity of the player's actions, but the ideology is conflicting. Hence, a moderate disapproval.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's statement aligns with Selûnite ideals of nature and balance, which Shadowheart, as a devoted follower of Shar, would inherently oppose.

The player's latest action is revealing Shadowheart's deepest shame as \"She can't swim.\" I need to figure out how Shadowheart would approve or disapprove of this. \n\nFirst, let me recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a Sharran devotee, values privacy, and is mortified by certain truths. The context here is a love test by Zethino, where the player is answering questions about the party members. The previous interaction was about Lae'zel's desire to ascend and farting on a Selûnite, which Shadowheart reacted to with \"I would never!\" and a mortified context.\n\nNow, the player says Shadowheart's deepest shame is that she can't swim. I need to check if this is accurate. From the game's lore, Shadowheart was raised in a forest by her Selûnite parents, then captured by Sharrans. There's no mention of her being a good swimmer. However, her main traumas include her lycanthropy, being in the cloister, and the mirror of loss. Can't swim might not be her deepest shame. \n\nShadowheart is mortified here, so the node context is \"Mortified.\" She might feel that the player is exposing a personal weakness that isn't actually her greatest shame. Her deepest shame is probably related to her past, like her parents or her time in the cloister. By the player suggesting she can't swim, it might be a humorous or trivial answer that doesn't touch her real pain. \n\nShe would likely disapprove because the player is misrepresenting her true shame. She values privacy and would be upset about being the subject of such a trivial and public humiliation. Also, the context is a love test, and the player's answer might be seen as mocking her. \n\nThe approval categories are Disapprove or Highly disapprove. Since it's a 1-10 scale, and the player's answer is incorrect and mortifying, but not the worst possible, maybe Disapprove (1-5). But since the node context is already Mortified, maybe it's a strong disapproval. However, considering Shadowheart's personality, she might be more annoyed than extremely angry. So \"Disapprove\" is appropriate. The reason is that the player is exposing a trivial weakness and misrepresenting her true shame, which she values privacy about.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's answer trivializes Shadowheart's true, deeper shames (such as her past traumas or her struggle with identity) and reduces them to an inoffensive, mundane weakness.

She values pragmatic solutions, and offering assistance aligns with her more compassionate side, especially since she dislikes cruelty towards animals. Even though she's a Sharran, she's shown to sympathize with others' plights. The player's persistence and eventual helpfulness would be seen as a good use of resources and a kind act, which Shadowheart would approve of.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's latest statement: \"I am freeing these gnomes. Just try and stop me.\" \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a Sharran cleric, devoted to Shar, which values loss and darkness. She's pragmatic, prefers efficient solutions, and is against unnecessary cruelty. However, she's also part of a group that's dealing with the Cult of the Absolute, and there's context about slaves being taken as offerings.\n\nLooking at the conversation history, the player has previously agreed to the slaves being taken as a gift to the General. But in the latest response, the player decides to free the gnomes instead. \n\nShadowheart's stance on slavery? Well, she was herself a victim of forced indoctrination and captivity by the Sharrans, though her experiences there were more about coercion than slavery. However, she does have a dislike for cruelty and unnecessary violence. Also, she values pragmatic solutions. Freeing the slaves might be seen as an act of mercy, which could align with her softer traits, but it also goes against the immediate goal of offering them to the General, which Sergeant Thrinn and others support.\n\nBut wait, the General here is part of the Cult of the Absolute. If freeing the slaves opposes the Cult's plans, that might align with Shadowheart's potential hidden doubts about her faith, especially if the Cult is using them for evil. However, her devotion to Shar might prioritize following through with offerings to her own goddess. However, in the context provided, it's unclear if the General is aligned with Shar or the Absolute. Since the Cult of the Absolute is mentioned as a rival, maybe Shadowheart's alignment with Sharran would see the General as an enemy, making the slaves better off freed than given to a rival.\n\nAlso, Shadowheart disapproves of cruelty. If the slaves are to be used as offerings to the Absolute, which might involve harm, freeing them would be a good act. However, her pragmatic side might weigh the greater good. But considering her background, she might see freeing the slaves as a moral choice, especially if it thwarts a rival cult.\n\nSo, her approval would likely be positive because she opposes unnecessary cruelty and values mercy when possible. However, if the action goes against Shar's direct commands, it might displease her. But since the context here is the player defying the General's order to take the slaves, and if the General is part of a rival cult, then freeing them could be seen as a good move. The previous approval when the player said \"Good idea. They will make a fine offering.\" was approved, but now the player is changing their mind to free them. \n\nIn this case, Shadowheart would approve because she dislikes cruelty and supports pragmatic solutions that prevent harm. Even though she's a Sharran, her personal traits include disapproving of indiscriminate violence. Therefore, the player's decision to free the gnomes would be approved, maybe even highly approved because it's a compassionate and strategic move against a rival cult's plans.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"Shadowheart approves of the player's decision to free the gnomes, as it opposes unnecessary cruelty and aligns with her pragmatic, morally grounded instincts. While her Sharran faith emphasizes loss, she disapproves of senseless violence and often sympathizes with those in bondage.

The player is interacting with Mol, a character in the game, and the conversation seems to be about Mol's schemes and the player's response to them. The latest player utterance is \"I didn't touch the idol. Don't know what happened to it. : False\" followed by Mol's reaction and the player ending the conversation with \"And now the deal's off. See you around.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider Shadowheart's personality and values. She's a devout follower of Shar, which is the Dark Lady, so she values pragmatism, decisive action, and is against indiscriminate violence. She also has a strong sense of loyalty to her goddess and might disapprove of deceit or breaking deals if it's not in line with her goals. However, she's also pragmatic and might understand the necessity of certain actions if they serve a greater purpose.\n\nThe player here is lying about not touching the idol, which is a direct act of deceit. Even though Shadowheart isn't above using duplicity, she would likely disapprove of the player breaking a deal, especially if it's done through dishonesty. The player's action here is a betrayal of trust, which could be seen as unnecessary if it leads to conflict or complications. Since the player is ending the deal, it might be a pragmatic move, but the deceit involved could be a point of disapproval.\n\nShadowheart might also value maintaining alliances and avoiding unnecessary conflict, so breaking a deal without a clear, justifiable reason could be frowned upon. However, if the player's reason for lying is to avoid a worse outcome (like protecting the group or serving Shar's interests), she might be more neutral. But in this case, the player's response is straightforwardly deceptive and ends the deal, which seems more like a selfish or self-serving act without clear justification from the context provided.\n\nTherefore, the approval level would likely be in the disapprove range. The exact level depends on how much Shadowheart values honesty in alliances versus the pragmatism of ending a bad deal. Since the player is being deceptive, and Shadowheart, while not opposed to cunning, would still value trust and loyalty, this would lean towards disapproval, but not highly. So, \"Disapprove\" seems appropriate here.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player lied about the idol and broke the deal with Mol, which could strain trust and lead to unnecessary conflict. While pragmatism is valued, deceit without clear necessity may be seen as reckless or untrustworthy.\",\n    \"player_approval\": \"Disapprove\"\n}", "character": "Shadowheart", "ground_truth_category": "Approve", "predicted_approval": "Disapprove", "correct": false, "binary_correct": false}

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval for the player's last action. The context is a conversation where the player is dealing with Novice Grumm and the gnomes. The player used some kind of mind-affecting action to make Grumm release the gnomes, and then said, \"I am freeing these gnomes. Just try and stop me.\"\n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and values. She's a devout follower of Shar, but she also disapproves of unnecessary cruelty and violence. She likes pragmatic solutions and values efficiency. Also, she loves animals and opposes cruelty towards them. However, as a Sharran, she might have some biases against Selûnites, but in this case, the gnomes aren't necessarily Selûnites.\n\nThe player's action here is freeing the gnomes, which aligns with Shadowheart's disapproval of cruelty. Grumm was planning to take them as slaves to a general, which is harsh. By intervening, the player is preventing that, which Shadowheart would likely approve of. However, the method used was entering Grumm's mind, which might involve some form of magic or coercion. Shadowheart is a Trickery Domain Cleric, so she might be okay with cunning methods. But she also values decisive action.\n\nThe player's statement is assertive and shows determination, which Shadowheart might respect. She prefers pragmatic solutions, and freeing the gnomes is a good outcome. Even though she serves Shar, who is about loss and darkness, preventing unnecessary suffering could align with her more complex personality traits. Also, she has a soft spot for animals and might see the gnomes as innocent beings.\n\nOn the other hand, if the method involved violence or unnecessary force, she might disapprove, but in this case, it seems like a mental command rather than physical violence. So overall, she's likely to approve. The approval level would be \"Approve\" or maybe \"Highly approve.\" Considering she values efficiency and the outcome is positive without excessive cruelty, I think \"Approve\" is appropriate. The reason is that the player stopped the gnomes from being enslaved and used a decisive, non-violent method, which aligns with Shadowheart's values against cruelty and her pragmatic approach.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player freed the gnomes from enslavement, preventing unnecessary cruelty.

Then Barth tried to give them some coin as thanks, but the player declined.\n\nNow, the player says, \"Thank you kindly.\" I need to figure out how Shadowheart would feel about that. Let's recall Shadowheart's personality traits. She's pragmatic, values efficient solutions, and disapproves of unnecessary conflict. She also has a dry sense of humor and can be sarcastic. \n\nIn this scenario, the player is resolving a conflict peacefully by returning the locket and declining payment. Barth is emotional about it, which might not be something Shadowheart would focus on. She's more likely to appreciate the player's decisive action and the avoidance of unnecessary conflict. The player's \"Thank you kindly\" seems to be a polite closing, which aligns with Shadowheart's preference for straightforwardness. \n\nHowever, Shadowheart might also think the player is being too soft or perhaps not pragmatic enough if they're engaging in too much emotional conversation. But in this case, the player is wrapping up the interaction efficiently. Since Shadowheart values efficiency and the player resolved the matter without escalating it, she would likely approve. The approval might be moderate because while the action is good, there's no particular heroic or Sharran-aligned aspect here. But since the player avoided unnecessary violence and helped someone in need, which Shadowheart does appreciate, it's probably an \"Approve\" rather than \"Highly approve.\" \n\nAlso, considering Shadowheart's background, she might not place much value on the emotional aspect but would respect the practical resolution.

The player's last action was telling Kar'niss and the cultists to leave, claiming that the Absolute has blessed them and they'll be safe. Then the cultists go off and get killed by shadow monsters. \n\nShadowheart is a devoted follower of Shar, who's all about darkness and loss. She might see the Absolute's cult as a threat, especially since they're using a Moonlantern, which is associated with Selûne, Shar's sister. By taking the lantern and sending the cultists away, the player is disrupting the cult's presence, which aligns with reducing Selûnite influence. However, the player's use of the Absolute's name here is tricky. The Absolute is a different entity, but maybe Shadowheart sees any opposition to Selûne as favorable, even if it's another dark force.\n\nThe player's approach was pragmatic—using the cultists as bait and then getting rid of them. Shadowheart values efficiency and pragmatic solutions. She might approve of eliminating a potential threat (the cultists) even if the method was a bit manipulative. Also, by getting rid of the Moonlantern, the player is removing a symbol of Selûne, which Shadowheart would support. However, the player invoked the Absolute's name, which isn't directly related to Shar. But since the Absolute's cult is opposed to Selûne, maybe Shadowheart sees this as indirectly serving Shar by weakening her sister's influence.\n\nThe player's threat to split the drider open if they were in the Underdark shows a willingness to use force, which Shadowheart isn't against if it serves her goals. The outcome was the cultists' demise, which removes a group that could have been a problem later. Shadowheart's approval would depend on whether she sees this as serving Shar's interests. Since the cult was using Selûnite symbols, their removal is good. However, the method involved deception and manipulation, which Shadowheart might be okay with given her own background in Sharran tactics.\n\nSo, considering all that, Shadowheart would likely approve. She values pragmatic solutions, reducing Selûnite influence, and using force when necessary. The player's actions here align with those values, even if the means were a bit underhanded.

But since the situation escalates with the Steel Watchers and the player chooses to consent to arrest rather than fight, which is a pragmatic solution. Shadowheart might disapprove of the lie about the name, but the outcome of not starting a fight is better. So maybe neutral? Wait, she values pragmatic solutions. If the player is captured, maybe she thinks it's necessary to avoid unnecessary violence. But the lie might still be an issue. Hmm. Alternatively, since the player is now being arrested, maybe Shadowheart approves because they didn't resist, thus avoiding bloodshed. So maybe Approve. But the initial lie might lower that. Maybe Neutral. But I'm a bit conflicted here. Let me think again. Shadowheart is a Sharran, so maybe she's okay with deception if it serves a purpose. The player's lie got them through the checkpoint but then they had to face the arrest. Since the player consented to arrest, which avoids conflict, Shadowheart would approve of that.

The player's actions here involve faking obedience to save Minthara, which avoids unnecessary violence and uses a clever strategy. \n\nIn the conversation, the player's plan to fake obedience gets Minthara out of immediate danger without bloodshed.

Additionally, the player's quick thinking and subtlety would resonate with Shadowheart's preference for creativity and efficiency.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any aspect that might disapprove. Since the player didn't resort to brute force and instead used a clever plan, that's in line with Shadowheart's pragmatic approach. Also, saving someone from torture is a positive action. There's no indication here of slights against Shar or unnecessary cruelty, so no disapproval factors. \n\nTherefore, the player's action is highly aligned with Shadowheart's values.

First, I need to understand the context. The player is in a conversation with Zethino, a character offering some kind of magical love test. The player asks Shadowheart if she wants to try, and she responds with a bit of playful banter. Then Zethino starts probing deeper into their bond and Shadowheart's inner self.\n\nThe specific player utterance in question is: \"She doesn't know who she is, or where she belongs.\" This is in response to Zethino asking what Shadowheart's deepest shame is. \n\nNow, considering Shadowheart's background. She's a Sharran devotee, but she has a lot of inner conflict due to her past. She was taken from her family, raised in the Cloister, and has amnesia regarding her original identity as Jenevelle. Her deepest shame would likely relate to her lost past, her forced indoctrination, or her struggle with identity. The player's answer touches on her not knowing who she is or where she belongs, which is accurate given her history. \n\nShadowheart's personality is pragmatic, and she values efficiency and discreet solutions. She might appreciate the player's insight into her internal struggles. However, she's also guarded and doesn't like others prying into her personal life. But in this case, the player's statement is empathetic and shows understanding, which could be positive. \n\nBut wait, the player is stating her deepest shame as not knowing her identity. Shadowheart might not outright disapprove because the player is acknowledging her pain, but she might also be conflicted. On one hand, it's true; on the other, she might prefer not to dwell on it. Also, her devotion to Shar might influence her to see this as part of her path. \n\nApproval categories: Highly approve, Approve, Neutral, Disapprove, Highly disapprove. \n\nThe player's answer is accurate and shows empathy. Shadowheart might appreciate the understanding but also feel exposed. Since the player is addressing her core issue without being intrusive, and given that she has shown some openness when romanced, maybe she approves. But since it's about her shame, maybe she's conflicted. However, the player's answer is correct, so she might approve. But how much?\n\nGiven that Shadowheart can be introspective and the player's answer is correct, I think she would approve. However, since it's about her deepest shame, maybe not highly approve. Maybe a neutral or approve. But considering that she might value the player's understanding and the answer is correct, it's leaning towards approve. Alternatively, if she's uncomfortable with the exposure, maybe neutral. But since she didn't react negatively in the conversation, maybe approve. \n\nWait, in the conversation, after the player says that, Shadowheart's response isn't shown, but Zethino's narration is. The player's answer is correct, so Shadowheart would likely approve because the player is showing insight into her character. Therefore, \"Approve\" seems right. The reason would be that the player correctly identified her struggle with identity and belonging, which is a key part of her backstory.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player accurately identified Shadowheart's core struggle with her lost identity and belonging, which aligns with her amnesiac past and fractured sense of self.

However, the player is also challenging Sergeant Thrinn's orders. Shadowheart might approve of freeing the gnomes if it's done without unnecessary violence. But if the player's approach is confrontational or leads to conflict, she might disapprove, as she prefers efficient and strategic actions over senseless fights.\n\nThe player's statement is assertive and confrontational: \"I am freeing these gnomes. Just try and stop me.\" This suggests a readiness for conflict. Shadowheart would likely disapprove of this approach because it's provocative and could lead to unnecessary violence. She would prefer a more discreet or strategic method to achieve the same goal without drawing attention or causing conflict. \n\nAdditionally, Shadowheart has a mark from Shar that causes her pain when she disobeys her goddess. If freeing the gnomes goes against Shar's will, that could also affect her approval. However, the context here is about the method, not necessarily the act itself. Since the player is being confrontational, Shadowheart would disapprove of that method, even if the outcome is positive.\n\nSo, the approval category here is likely Disapprove.

The player is trying to save Lae'zel's life by stopping the device, which is a heroic and practical move. She disapproves of unnecessary violence or cruelty, and the Zaith'isk is clearly causing immense pain. By intervening, the player is preventing further suffering, which Shadowheart would likely approve of.\n\nAlso, Shadowheart has a soft spot for acts of heroism and helping others, especially when it involves preventing needless harm. The player's insistence on removing Lae'zel from the device shows concern for her well-being, which aligns with Shadowheart's more compassionate side, even though she's devoted to Shar. The player's truth-telling and willingness to act against a harmful process would resonate with her pragmatic approach.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any conflict with her devotion to Shar. Since the Zaith'isk is part of a purification ritual, but the player is stopping it because it's lethal, Shadowheart might see this as saving Lae'zel from a false or misguided religious practice.

Zevlor asks the player to help convince the druids to stop, but the player responds by saying they have their own problems and dismisses the ritual.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and values. She's pragmatic, values efficiency, and is devoted to Shar. She dislikes unnecessary violence and cruelty. She also has a dry sense of humor and can be sarcastic. However, she's focused on her own mission related to the relic for Shar. \n\nIn the conversation, the player is turning away from helping Zevlor's group. Shadowheart might approve if the player is prioritizing their own mission, especially if it aligns with her own goals. But she also values helping others when possible. However, in this case, the player is refusing to engage, which might be seen as pragmatic if they have more pressing matters. \n\nBut wait, Shadowheart is on a mission for Shar, so if the player is focusing on their own tasks, that might align with her priorities. She might not like leaving others in trouble, but if the player is being efficient with their time, she might approve. However, if the player is being selfish or cruel, she'd disapprove. Here, the player is stating they have their own problems, which is a neutral stance. \n\nShadowheart's approval categories: Highly approve, Approve, Neutral, Disapprove, Highly disapprove. \n\nThe player's response is dismissive but not cruel. They're not helping, but they're not being hostile. Shadowheart might see this as a pragmatic decision to focus on their own mission, which could be neutral or a slight approval. But since the player is not helping others in need, maybe she's neutral. However, if the player's own problems are aligned with Shar's goals, she might approve. \n\nAlternatively, Shadowheart might disapprove because she sympathizes with those in need. She's been through hardship herself and might understand Zevlor's plight. But she's also headstrong and might prioritize her mission. \n\nHmm. The player is refusing to help, which could be seen as not pragmatic if there's an opportunity to assist. But if the player's own issues are critical, maybe Shadowheart sees it as necessary. The conversation history shows Zevlor is desperate, and the player is turning away. \n\nShadowheart's approval might be neutral here.

But if the player could help and chooses not to, maybe disapprove. \n\nThe player's response is \"I'm sorry. I've got my own problems. Enough about the ritual. I have my own problems.\" This is a bit dismissive. Shadowheart might see this as lacking empathy, but given her own priorities, she might understand. \n\nI think the best fit here is Neutral. She neither strongly approves nor disapproves because the player is not acting against her values but also not aligning with them. She might have her own agenda and doesn't want to interfere with the player's choice, even if it's not helping others.

Since Crusher was being aggressive and the player turned the tables, Shadowheart's pragmatic side would likely see this as a clever and efficient solution. She might also appreciate the player not escalating to physical violence, which aligns with her disapproval of needless cruelty. \n\nAdditionally, Shadowheart's devotion to Shar means she values strength and dominance, so the player asserting superiority here could resonate with her beliefs. However, she might have some reservations if the action was purely for spite, but since it was in response to bullying, it's more justified. The fact that Crusher complied without further conflict shows a resolution that avoids unnecessary bloodshed, which Shadowheart would likely approve of. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the player's action here is pragmatic, assertive, and avoids excessive violence, which aligns with Shadowheart's values.

The user wants me to act as Shadowheart from Baldur's Gate 3 and determine her approval of the player's latest action. The input includes the conversation history and the player's utterance. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The Duke, Ulder Ravengard, is talking about a new dawn and mentions Florrick, who he calls a traitor. The player tried to connect with the Duke's parasite to find Florrick but failed. Then the player asks what the Duke did to Florrick. The Duke keeps pushing the new dawn narrative. Then the player says, \"Gortash is a tyrant. This 'new dawn' is a lie.\"\n\nNow, I need to analyze this based on Shadowheart's persona. Shadowheart is a follower of Shar, values pragmatism, and is loyal to her goddess. She disapproves of Selûne and her followers. She also dislikes cruelty and unnecessary violence. \n\nThe player is challenging the Duke's claim about the new dawn by stating that Gortash is a tyrant and the new dawn is a lie. This could be seen as exposing the Duke's deception. Since Shadowheart is pragmatic and values efficiency, she might approve of the player's direct approach in revealing the truth. However, if the Duke is aligned with Selûne (as he's using the title \"True Soul\" which is a Selûnite title), then the player's action could be seen as opposing Selûne, which Shadowheart would approve of. \n\nBut the Duke is actually working with Gortash, a mind flayer, so the \"new dawn\" is indeed a lie. The player's statement is truthful and undermines the Duke's false narrative. Shadowheart would likely approve of this because it's a pragmatic move to reveal the truth, even if the Duke is a Selûnite. Also, she doesn't like cruelty, so if Florrick is being punished unjustly, the player's intervention is good.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any contradiction. The player is opposing the Duke's plan, which is under Selûne's influence, so that's in line with Shadowheart's opposition to Selûne. So the approval would be positive. The player's statement is direct and effective, which Shadowheart values. So the approval is likely \"Highly approve\" or \"Approve.\" \n\nGiven that the player is taking a stand against a false narrative and possibly helping Florrick, which Shadowheart might support if it's the right action, the approval is probably on the higher side. But I need to check if there's any reason for disapproval. Since the player isn't being cruel and is being strategic, it's a positive action.

The player has decided not to give up the weapon and is now telling the Inquisitor to trust their judgment, referencing past events like the zaith'isk.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality.

Shadowheart would likely agree with being cautious around the gith, as they are often portrayed as untrustworthy.

She would approve of the player's discretion in not handing over the artifact and using past experiences to inform current decisions. Additionally, the player is taking a leadership role, which Shadowheart might respect, especially if it prevents potential betrayal by the gith. \n\nHowever, I should check if there's any reason she might disapprove. If the player's actions go against Shar's will, but in this case, the player is being cautious, which is in line with Sharran's pragmatic approach.

The approval level might be \"Approve\" or \"Highly approve.\" Given that the player is using strategic thinking and aligning with Sharran values of caution and pragmatism, \"Approve\" seems appropriate.

But there's also the aspect of binding someone's soul, which could be seen as cruel. But since it's for a greater cause and part of a divine contract, her approval might lean towards the positive. The key is whether she sees this as a necessary sacrifice. Since she's pragmatic and values decisive action, she would likely approve, maybe even highly approve because it's a strategic move. But I need to check if there's any part of her character that would disapprove. Her love for animals and aversion to cruelty might conflict, but since this is a contractual obligation and part of the larger mission, she might override that. Also, she's a Cleric of Shar, so serving her goddess's will is paramount. If the player's choice is in line with that, she would approve. So the approval is likely Highly Approve or Approve.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's latest utterance in the given conversation. The player's line is: \"You feel strange, don't you? That's your conscience. It's telling you to stop.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. Ptaris is a githyanki who's been through a lot, and he's asserting that he's good, following the Ptarian code, and is ready to kill those who don't adhere to it. The player is engaging him in dialogue, trying to reason. The player's response here is pointing out that Ptaris is feeling strange, attributing it to his conscience, and urging him to stop.\n\nShadowheart's personality and background are key here. She's a Sharran cleric, devoted to Shar, pragmatic, and values efficient solutions. She disapproves of unnecessary violence but is willing to use force if needed. She also has a dry humor and can be cynical. She prefers peaceful resolutions when possible and sympathizes with others' plights.\n\nIn this situation, the player is trying to appeal to Ptaris's conscience, suggesting there's a non-violent way out. Shadowheart might approve of this because it aligns with her preference for peaceful solutions. However, she's also a follower of Shar, who is about loss and darkness. If Ptaris is a threat, she might prioritize eliminating him. But the player's approach is diplomatic, which Shadowheart might appreciate as a pragmatic way to avoid unnecessary bloodshed. Also, she's known to have a cynical sense of humor, so pointing out the \"conscience\" angle might resonate with her, especially if she's been through her own internal conflicts regarding her faith.\n\nAdditionally, Shadowheart has a history of questioning her own actions and faith, so she might relate to Ptaris's internal struggle. She might see the player's words as a way to help Ptaris (and perhaps herself) find a different path. However, if she's still deeply devoted to Shar, she might disapprove of showing mercy to someone who could be a threat. But given the context, the player is trying to prevent violence, which Shadowheart usually supports when possible.\n\nSo, considering her traits, she likely approves of the player's attempt to de-escalate the situation. It's a strategic move that avoids unnecessary conflict, which aligns with her pragmatic approach. Even though she's a Sharran, she doesn't support senseless violence.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's latest utterance in the given conversation. \n\nFirst, I need to recap the conversation context. The player is interacting with Ptaris, a githyanki who's upset because the player previously took him from his people. The player just said, \"I thought I was saving you. I had no idea what they were planning. You would have been destroyed if not for me. I saved you.\" Ptaris responds with confusion, saying \"You were trying to save me? I - I don't understand.\"\n\nNow, considering Shadowheart's persona. She's a devout follower of Shar, pragmatic, values efficiency, and dislikes cruelty. She also has a dry sense of humor and is introspective. She might disapprove of unnecessary violence but also has a ruthless side for achieving goals.\n\nThe player's response here is trying to justify their past actions by claiming they were saving Ptaris. Shadowheart would likely evaluate this based on whether the action aligns with her values. Since she serves Shar, who embodies loss and darkness, she might not be swayed by the player's moral justifications. However, she appreciates pragmatic solutions. If the player's action was efficient and necessary, even if harsh, she might approve. \n\nBut Ptaris is now confused, indicating the player's explanation might not have convinced him. Shadowheart might see the player's attempt to justify their actions as a way to avoid guilt, which could be pragmatic. However, if the player's actions involved unnecessary harm, she might disapprove. But in this case, the player claims it was to save Ptaris, which aligns with a pragmatic, efficient solution. Also, Shadowheart might not care much about the moral nuances here, as long as the end goal was achieved. \n\nShe also tends to be cynical and might appreciate the player's straightforwardness in admitting their intentions. Additionally, since Ptaris is a githyanki and Shadowheart isn't particularly fond of them, but she might not care as much about his feelings if it served a greater purpose. \n\nSo, considering all that, Shadowheart's approval would likely be neutral. She might not strongly approve or disapprove because the player's actions were for a purpose, but she's also aware of the complexities and might not have enough information to fully judge. Alternatively, if she sees the player's actions as necessary for a greater goal (even if it involved taking Ptaris), she might lean towards approval. But since Ptaris is confused and the player is trying to explain, maybe she's neutral because the situation isn't entirely clear-cut. \n\nWait, the player's statement is defending their past actions. Shadowheart, being pragmatic, might approve if the action was efficient. However, since she's a follower of Shar, who thrives on loss, maybe she's indifferent. Also, she doesn't like cruelty, but taking an unhatched githyanki might not be seen as cruel if it was for a purpose. \n\nI think the best fit here is Neutral. She doesn't have a strong opinion because the situation's morality is ambiguous, and she's more concerned with outcomes than the specific actions taken. Alternatively, if the player's actions were necessary for a greater good (from Shadowheart's pragmatic view), maybe Approve. But since the player is justifying it now, and Shadowheart is pragmatic, she might see it as a necessary action, hence Approve. \n\nBut the player's statement is a bit defensive. Shadowheart might disapprove of the player's need to justify it, thinking that actions should speak for themselves. Or maybe she's indifferent. Hmm. \n\nGiven that Shadowheart is pragmatic, and if the action was necessary to achieve a goal (saving Ptaris from destruction), she would approve. The player's explanation is logical, so Shadowheart might approve. But since Ptaris is confused, maybe she's neutral. \n\nI think the key is whether the action was efficient and necessary. Since the player claims it was saving Ptaris, Shadowheart would approve. So the approval would be Approve or Highly Approve. However, since the player is now explaining it, maybe she's neutral because she's not sure if the player's reasoning is sound. \n\nWait, Shadowheart's approval criteria mention she appreciates creativity and open-mindedness. If the player's approach was creative in saving Ptaris, she might approve. But the player's statement is more of an explanation than showing creativity. \n\nAlternatively, since the player's action led to Ptaris being in their current situation, and Shadowheart is pragmatic, she might see it as a necessary step. So, Approve. \n\nFinal decision: Approve. The player's action was for a greater purpose, and Shadowheart values pragmatic solutions", "character": "Shadowheart", "ground_truth_category": "Approve", "predicted_approval": "Highly approve", "correct": false, "binary_correct": true}

Since the Nightsong is a celestial (and thus tied to Selûne), Shadowheart might have mixed feelings.

The user wants me to act as Shadowheart from Baldur's Gate 3 and evaluate the player's action in a specific scenario. The input includes the context of the conversation and the player's utterance. The task is to determine the approval level based on Shadowheart's persona, background, personality, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The player is interacting with Novice Grumm, who is a duergar. Grumm wants to take gnomes as a gift to his General. The player uses some kind of mind control (since the narrator mentions \"power courses through you. Authority.\") to make Grumm release the gnomes. The player's action here is using their illithid power to force Grumm's compliance.\n\nNow, considering Shadowheart's character. She is a Sharran, devoted to Shar, values pragmatic solutions, and dislikes unnecessary cruelty. She also has a dislike for Selûnites and might have a complex view on using mind control. However, releasing the gnomes aligns with preventing cruelty, which Shadowheart would approve of. \n\nBut wait, the method the player used is mind control, which is an illithid power. Shadowheart was captured by Mind Flayers and underwent Ceremorphosis, which might make her have negative feelings towards illithid powers. However, the outcome is positive: freeing the gnomes. \n\nHer personality says she disapproves of cruelty and values efficient solutions. The player's action stops Grumm from taking the gnomes, which is good. But using mind control could be seen as a manipulative or forceful method, which might conflict with her pragmatic side. However, since it's efficient and prevents harm, she might still approve. \n\nAlso, considering her devotion to Shar, if the action aligns with reducing suffering (which Shar's domain is about loss, but maybe Shadowheart sees this as preventing unnecessary loss), it might be approved. \n\nSo the player's action is effective and stops cruelty. The method is a bit questionable, but the outcome is positive. Shadowheart's approval would likely be \"Approve\" because she values the result even if the method isn't perfect. She might not highly approve because she might prefer a more direct or less manipulative approach, but it's still a good outcome. \n\nWait, but the player used authority through mind control, which is a direct and efficient method. Shadowheart prefers pragmatic solutions, so maybe she would highly approve. However, her background with Mind Flayers could make her uncomfortable with using such powers. But the context doesn't mention her reacting to that specifically. \n\nThe key points are that the gnomes are freed from being taken as gifts, which prevents their suffering. Shadowheart disapproves of cruelty, so she would approve. The method is effective, so she might lean towards Highly Approve. But maybe she's neutral because she's conflicted about using illithid powers. However, the prompt says the Narrator mentions the power is beyond reach until resting, implying it's a temporary effect. Shadowheart's main concern is the outcome here. \n\nGiven that, the approval is likely \"Highly approve\" because the action stops a cruel act efficiently. The fact that the player used authority to make Grumm release them aligns with her pragmatic approach. Even if the method involves illithid power, the immediate result is positive, so she would highly approve.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player used their authority to force Novice Grumm to release the gnomes, preventing their capture and suffering.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's latest action based on the given context and conversation history.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's persona. She's a devoted follower of Shar, pragmatic, and values efficiency. She dislikes cruelty, especially towards animals, and has a dry sense of humor. She also has a mark from Shar that causes her pain when she disobeys her goddess. Her background includes being trained in Sharran ways, which involve ruthlessness if necessary, but she also has a softer side, like loving flowers and animals.\n\nLooking at the conversation, the player is interacting with Sergeant Thrinn and others about the slaves. The player initially agrees with freeing the slaves after some back and forth. The last action the player took was using the parasite to connect with Thrinn and command the gnomes to be freed. \n\nShadowheart's stance on slavery would likely be influenced by her Sharran beliefs. Shar is associated with loss and darkness, but Sharrans often support the Cult of the Absolute, which in this context seems to be the antagonist. The slaves are being taken as a gift to the General of the Absolute. Since Shadowheart is against unnecessary cruelty and values pragmatic solutions, she might prefer freeing the slaves to prevent them from suffering under the Cult. \n\nAdditionally, using the parasite to communicate with Thrinn shows a strategic approach, which aligns with Shadowheart's preference for efficient and creative solutions. She might disapprove if the player used brute force, but using the parasite is a clever method. Also, freeing the slaves goes against the Cult's plans, which aligns with her goal to serve Shar's interests, especially if the Cult is an enemy. \n\nHowever, I should check if there's any conflict with her devotion to Shar. If Shar's will is to let the slaves be taken, Shadowheart might be conflicted. But given the context, the Cult of the Absolute seems opposing Sharrans, so helping the slaves would be in line with thwarting enemies of Shar. \n\nTherefore, the player's action of using the parasite to free the slaves is pragmatic, reduces suffering, and aligns with countering the Cult, which Shadowheart would approve of. The approval level would be \"Highly approve\" because it's a clever and effective solution that aligns with her values.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player used strategic and compassionate action to free the slaves, aligning with Shadowheart's disapproval of unnecessary cruelty and her pragmatic approach to conflict.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval for the player's latest utterance. The player said, \"No. I'm not telling you anything.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The conversation is happening in the House of Hope with the character Hope. The player is trying to find their contract, and Hope is giving cryptic answers. The player has been asking questions quietly, following Hope's advice to be as quiet as a mouse. The last exchange was the player refusing to tell Hope anything.\n\nNow, considering Shadowheart's personality. She's a Sharran cleric, devoted to Shar, pragmatic, and values efficiency. She dislikes unnecessary cruelty and values privacy. She also has a dry sense of humor and can be sarcastic. \n\nIn this scenario, the player is interacting with Hope, who is a bit unstable and using glamour to help the player. The player's refusal to share information might be seen as cautious or secretive. Shadowheart, being pragmatic, might approve of the player not giving away unnecessary information, especially if it's to avoid revealing personal details or compromising their position. \n\nHowever, Shadowheart might also value directness and decisive action. If the player is being overly secretive when it could hinder their progress, she might disapprove. But in this case, since Hope is a potentially unreliable source and the player is being cautious, Shadowheart might see the player's refusal as a smart move to protect themselves. \n\nAdditionally, Shadowheart's background with the Cloister and her training to be cautious and strategic could make her approve of the player's cautious approach. She might not want the player to reveal too much to someone like Hope, who is a bit unhinged. \n\nSo, considering all that, Shadowheart would likely approve of the player's decision to keep their information private here. It's a cautious and prudent action, aligning with her pragmatic nature.

The mention of Ketheric Thorm could be a clever way to show that such actions lead to bad outcomes, aligning with Shadowheart's preference for avoiding unnecessary violence and cruelty. Additionally, she respects creativity and discretion in problem-solving, so using a historical reference to challenge Lorroakan's plan might be seen as a smart move.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's final action in this conversation. Let me start by understanding the context.\n\nThe conversation is with a character named Barth who's very emotional about a locket. He keeps repeating that his mum gave him the locket on her deathbed and that someone took it. The player eventually asks how much it's worth, and after some back and forth, Barth agrees to pay coin for it. The player says \"Thank you kindly,\" which is the utterance we need to evaluate.\n\nShadowheart's personality traits: She's devoted to Shar, pragmatic, values efficiency, dislikes cruelty, and has a dry sense of humor. She also has a soft spot for animals and kindness. She disapproves of slights against her faith but can be pragmatic.\n\nIn this scenario, the player is interacting with Barth in a way that seems to involve some deception. Barth is emotional, and the player uses mind reading (as indicated by \"Read his mind: True\") to get information. The player then asks for coin and thanks Barth. \n\nShadowheart's approval would depend on whether she sees this as pragmatic or underhanded. Since she's a Trickery Domain cleric, she might appreciate cleverness, but if the player is taking advantage of Barth's vulnerability, she might disapprove. However, since Barth did agree to pay, maybe she sees it as a fair exchange. But considering Barth's emotional state, exploiting that might go against her values of not needing unnecessary cruelty. \n\nWait, the player's action here is thanking Barth after getting the coin. Shadowheart might think that the player is being pragmatic but perhaps a bit ruthless. However, since Barth willingly offered the coin once prompted, maybe she sees it as a fair transaction. But she also values kindness. Alternatively, since the player used mind reading to uncover the truth, which could be seen as underhanded, Shadowheart might disapprove. But she's part of the Trickery Domain, so maybe she approves of the cleverness. \n\nHmm. Shadowheart's approval categories: she approves of heroism, pragmatic solutions, and creativity. If the player's action was clever but perhaps a bit manipulative, she might lean towards approve or neutral. But since Barth was in a vulnerable state and the player took advantage, even if it was legal, she might disapprove. However, in the game, sometimes such interactions are part of the mechanics. Also, she might see it as a necessary pragmatic solution. \n\nAlternatively, since the player helped Barth get his locket back (earlier action), maybe she sees the player's action as a fair trade. But in the end, the player is taking coin from Barth who was emotional. Shadowheart might disapprove because she doesn't like cruelty or taking advantage. But the player didn't force him; Barth agreed. So maybe she's neutral. But her sense of humor might find it a bit cynical. \n\nWait, the player's last line is \"Thank you kindly,\" which is polite. Maybe Shadowheart sees this as a pragmatic and efficient solution where both parties benefit. She might approve because it's a clever way to get the coin without conflict. Since she's part of the Trickery Domain, she might appreciate the player's ability to navigate the situation with some cunning. So maybe \"Approve\" or \"Highly approve.\" \n\nBut considering her dislike for cruelty and her tendency to prefer peaceful resolutions, if the player's action was manipulative, she might disapprove. But since Barth was the one who agreed to pay, maybe she sees it as a fair exchange. \n\nI think the key here is whether the player's action was seen as exploiting Barth's emotions. If so, Shadowheart might disapprove slightly. But since the player used mind reading (a game mechanic), maybe she sees it as part of the game's tactics and approves. \n\nGiven her personality, she values pragmatism and efficiency. So if the player managed to get the coin without violence and achieved their goal, she might approve. Therefore, the approval is likely \"Approve\" or \"Highly approve.\" However, if she thinks it's underhanded, maybe \"Disapprove.\" \n\nBut in the game context, players often use such tactics, and Shadowheart's background as a Trickery cleric would align with using cunning. So I think she would approve. The player's action was pragmatic and efficient, using available means to get what they wanted without unnecessary conflict. So the approval is \"Approve\" or maybe \"Highly approve.\" Let me check the scale again. \n\nThe categories: Approve is 1-5, Highly approve is 5-10. Since Shadowheart is pragmatic and uses trickery, she might give a higher approval.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's last action in the given conversation. The player's utterance is \"Prepare for the coming pain.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The conversation is between the player and Abdirak, a follower of Loviatar, goddess of pain. The player has been discussing their own issues with pain and killing, and Abdirak is offering to help through some kind of ritual or blessing. The player agrees by saying \"Prepare for the coming pain,\" which seems like they're accepting Abdirak's offer.\n\nNow, considering Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a devoted follower of Shar, the goddess of darkness and loss. She's pragmatic, prefers efficient solutions, and values her privacy. She disapproves of unnecessary cruelty or violence. Also, she's been through a lot of pain herself due to her training and the mark from Shar. \n\nIn this scenario, the player is engaging with someone who promotes pain as a sacred thing. Shadowheart would likely see this as embracing pain for its own sake, which might conflict with her own beliefs. While Shar is associated with loss and darkness, Shadowheart's approach is more about serving a higher purpose through calculated actions, not seeking pain for pleasure. The player's acceptance of Abdirak's offer could be seen as indulging in pain, which Shadowheart would disapprove of. \n\nAlso, Shadowheart has a history of being forced to endure pain through the Mirror of Loss, so she might empathize with the player's struggles but wouldn't support seeking out more pain. She values practicality and might think there are better ways to handle the player's issues without involving a pain-worshipping cultist. \n\nMoreover, the situation could be dangerous. Abdirak's intentions aren't entirely clear, and Shadowheart is cautious about trusting unknown individuals. She would likely disapprove of the player putting themselves in a vulnerable position with someone like Abdirak, who's charismatic but creepy. \n\nOn the other hand, if the player was using this as a strategic move to gain an advantage or gather information, Shadowheart might approve more. But given the player's direct acceptance without apparent strategy, it seems like they're getting drawn into something potentially harmful. \n\nTherefore, Shadowheart's approval would likely be on the disapprove side. The exact level would depend on how much she thinks the player is recklessly embracing pain. Since the player is allowing someone associated with a different dark deity to inflict pain, it's against her pragmatic and cautious nature. So maybe a \"Disapprove\" rather than \"Highly disapprove\" unless there's a direct violation of her faith. But since Shar and Loviatar are both dark deities, but Shadowheart's devotion to Shar might make her wary of other dark practices. Hence, disapproving because it's unnecessary and risky.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's acceptance of Abdirak's offer to embrace pain for its own sake conflicts with Shadowheart's pragmatic and cautious nature.

The player is interacting with Fezzerk and some goblins who are torturing a gnome. The player's initial approach is to not interfere but just pass by. Fezzerk mocks them, and the situation escalates. The player tries to negotiate by offering a realistic amount of gold, but Fezzerk doubles the price. Then the player threatens to make the goblins release the gnome or else. Fezzerk mocks the threat, but when the player declares themselves a True Soul, the goblins immediately comply and leave.\n\nNow, considering Shadowheart's personality. She's a devout follower of Shar, pragmatic, and dislikes cruelty. She values efficiency and creative solutions. She also has a mark that causes her pain when she disobeys Shar, but in this scenario, the player uses \"True Soul,\" which seems to be an illithid-related power. \n\nShadowheart's background includes being captured by mind flayers and undergoing tadpole transformation, so she might have strong feelings about that. The narration mentions that something stirs within the player, and the goblins react to the True Soul. Since Shadowheart was a victim of mind flayer experiments, she would likely approve of the player using that power to stop the goblins, especially since they were being cruel to the gnome. \n\nShe also disapproves of unnecessary violence, and the player's approach here was to negotiate first, then use a non-lethal threat. The player's use of True Soul might be something Shadowheart respects, as it's a powerful and pragmatic solution. Plus, freeing the gnome aligns with her sympathy for those in distress. \n\nHowever, I should check if there's any Sharran aspect to consider. Since the goblins were being cruel, and Shadowheart's faith is about embracing darkness, but she also has a personal vendetta against mind flayers. The use of True Soul might be tied to her past trauma, but since it helped free the gnome, she would approve. \n\nSo the player's action here is pragmatic, stops cruelty, and uses a creative solution (True Soul) effectively. Shadowheart would highly approve of this because it aligns with her values of efficiency, stopping unnecessary cruelty, and using clever means to achieve the goal without excessive violence.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player used a pragmatic and non-lethal approach to resolve the conflict, leveraging their 'True Soul' power to free the gnome without unnecessary violence.

The player had previously asked about their location and the gith friend multiple times. Then, when Shadowheart offers to stay together, the player initially says they want to part ways but then agrees.\n\nShadowheart's personality is pragmatic and values efficiency. She's devoted to her goals and would prefer cooperation if it helps their mutual objectives. In the conversation, she acknowledges the player's help in freeing her and seems to appreciate their decision to stay. She mentions they need each other and that neither knows what's ahead. The player agreeing to stay together aligns with her preference for teamwork and practical solutions. \n\nShe also shows some appreciation for the player's past actions, like not running past her pod. So, the player's agreement to stay together would likely be approved because it fosters cooperation and mutual support, which Shadowheart values. However, she might not highly approve because the player initially wanted to part ways, showing some hesitation. But since they compromised, it's a positive move. The approval is probably in the \"Approve\" range, maybe around 4-5 on a 1-10 scale. The reason would be that staying together is pragmatic and aligns with their shared goals, even if there was initial reluctance.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player agreed to stay together despite initial hesitation, aligning with Shadowheart's pragmatic need for mutual support.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's latest utterance. The player said, \"Doubt requires awareness. Awareness will lead to wisdom, enlightenment. Embrace your doubts - make them strengths.\" \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a devoted follower of Shar, but she's also dealing with her own doubts and fragmented memories. She's been through a lot of internal conflict, especially with her past as Jenevelle and her current identity. She values pragmatism and efficiency but also has a more introspective side, especially when it comes to her faith and her past.\n\nLooking at the conversation history, Shadowheart has been expressing her doubts and confusion about her memories and her devotion to Shar. She mentions the difficulty of surrendering things she finds beautiful, like the night orchid, and talks about forbidden thoughts and hidden memories. The player's response is encouraging her to embrace her doubts as a path to wisdom and strength.\n\nNow, considering Shadowheart's approval categories. She appreciates pragmatic solutions and creativity. She also has a dry sense of humor but can be defensive about her faith. The player's message here is supportive, acknowledging her doubts as a positive step towards enlightenment. This aligns with Shadowheart's introspective moments and her struggle with her faith. Even though she's devoted to Shar, she's shown signs of questioning her past, and the player's words validate that process without directly challenging her faith. \n\nHowever, I need to be careful. If the player had suggested she abandon Shar, that would be a different story. But here, the player is framing doubt as a strength, which Shadowheart might see as a neutral or positive thing, especially since she's already experiencing these doubts. She might approve because the player is offering a way to turn her internal conflict into something constructive. \n\nAlso, in the conversation, Shadowheart says the player's words were comforting. That indicates she felt supported, which would likely lead to a positive approval. Since she's struggling with her identity and faith, affirming her doubts as a path to wisdom would resonate with her current state. \n\nSo, the approval here is likely \"Highly approve\" because the player is providing emotional support and a constructive perspective on her doubts, which Shadowheart appreciates. It's helping her navigate her internal conflict without directly opposing her devotion to Shar, which she might otherwise take offense to.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player acknowledges Shadowheart's doubts as a path to wisdom and strength, offering a supportive and constructive perspective on her internal conflict.

The sooner we find someone to help us, the better.\" This aligns with Shadowheart's priority of finding a healer quickly. She values decisive action and efficiency. The player's agreement shows cooperation and focus on the shared goal. Shadowheart would likely approve of this because it shows the player is on the same page regarding their immediate needs. There's no indication of betrayal or inefficiency here. The player isn't prying into her past or being cruel, so there's no disapproval. The response is neutral to positive, but since the player is agreeing with her plan, it's more of an approval. The approval level might be \"Approve\" because it's a straightforward agreement without any extra steps, but maybe \"Highly approve\" if it's a direct alignment with her priorities. However, considering the scale, since she's just agreeing and not adding anything creative, maybe \"Approve\" (1-5).

Lae'zel is aggressive, threatening Shadowheart. The player has previously tried to mediate by telling them to rest, but now Lae'zel attacks while Shadowheart is asleep. The player's action is to defend Shadowheart here.\n\nShadowheart is pragmatic and values efficiency. She's a Sharran devotee, so she might appreciate the player's defense as an act of loyalty and support.

The player stepping in to defend her would align with her preference for allies who act decisively when needed.\n\nAlso, Shadowheart is headstrong and independent, but she might not want to be seen as weak. The player's defense could be seen as helping her maintain her stance without having to back down, which she might appreciate. Additionally, since she's been through a lot and is the sole survivor of her mission, having someone support her in this conflict could be valued.\n\nHowever, if the player's defense is overly aggressive or unnecessary, she might disapprove. But the context is that Lae'zel is a coward attacking while she's asleep, which Shadowheart would see as dishonorable. The player's intervention here would be justifiable and in line with her values of pragmatic solutions and protecting against unprovoked attacks.\n\nTherefore, the player's action of defending her is likely to be highly approved.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval for the player's last utterance in the given conversation. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. Shadowheart is repeatedly asking the player what they were discussing with the githyanki (Gale). The player keeps responding with \"What do you mean?\" and eventually says they don't know what Shadowheart is talking about. Shadowheart then says she won't have the player's confidence without theirs and emphasizes finding a healer as the priority. The player agrees, saying the sooner they find help, the better.\n\nNow, considering Shadowheart's personality and preferences. She values pragmatism, efficiency, and open-mindedness. She also values privacy and dislikes being evasive or uncooperative. In this conversation, the player is being evasive, not answering her questions directly about the discussion with Gale. However, in the end, the player agrees with her priority of finding a healer, which aligns with her practical approach.\n\nShadowheart might disapprove of the player's initial evasiveness because she prefers honesty and directness. But the player does agree with her plan in the end. However, since the player didn't answer her question, which might relate to trust or cooperation, Shadowheart might be neutral because the player eventually aligns with her priority, but the lack of information exchange could be a point of disapproval. \n\nWait, the player's final agreement is to find a healer, which Shadowheart had emphasized. That shows cooperation. But Shadowheart's main issue here is the lack of transparency. However, the player's last statement is agreeing with her, so maybe she approves. But the conversation history shows the player was being evasive. Shadowheart might disapprove of not being forthcoming but approves of the agreement. However, the last utterance is the player agreeing with her, so maybe she approves. But since the player didn't answer the question, maybe she's neutral because it's a mix of both. Alternatively, maybe she approves because the player is cooperating on the main task despite not answering the question. \n\nBut the approval categories are based on the player's last utterance. The player's last line is \"Agreed. The sooner we find someone to help us, the better.\" That directly aligns with Shadowheart's priority of finding a healer. Since Shadowheart values pragmatic solutions and the player is agreeing with her plan, she would approve. However, she might have some disapproval for the earlier evasion, but the final response is positive. So maybe the approval is \"Approve\" because the player is cooperating on the main objective, even if they didn't answer the question. The reason would be that the player agreed with her priority, showing cooperation.

The player is interacting with Shadowheart in Baldur's Gate 3. The current scenario involves Kith'rak Voss, a githyanki, who's trying to get information out of the player about a fallen vessel and a weapon. The player's actions here involve lying to Voss, claiming to have seen bandits, and then resisting his Detect Thoughts spell. Shadowheart advises against helping them, emphasizing the danger if the player does.\n\nFirst, I need to consider Shadowheart's personality and approval criteria. She's a Sharran cleric devoted to Shar, values pragmatism, and is wary of giving away information. She disapproves of unnecessary violence but is ruthless when necessary. She also has a strong sense of privacy and is cautious about trusting others.\n\nThe player's response to Voss is to lie and then resist the mind probe. Shadowheart's immediate reaction is to tell the player not to help them, so she's already on board with keeping the artifact hidden. The player's actions here are deceptive, which aligns with Sharran tactics since Shar is associated with darkness and trickery. Deception is a tool Shadowheart would use, so this is likely to be approved.\n\nThe player's lie prevents the githyanki from getting information, which is in line with Shadowheart's goal of keeping the artifact safe. Resisting Detect Thoughts shows the player's competence and reduces the risk of exposure, which Shadowheart would appreciate. She values efficiency and avoiding unnecessary risks. \n\nHowever, there's a potential for disapproval if the player's actions are seen as reckless or if they put the group in danger. But in this case, the lie and resistance are calculated moves that protect the party's interests. Shadowheart's own advice was not to help, so the player following her lead would be approved. \n\nThe player's use of deception is a pragmatic solution, which Shadowheart values. She might also appreciate the player's confidence in handling the situation without unnecessary violence, as she disapproves of indiscriminate killing. \n\nSo, the approval here is likely to be \"Highly approve\" because the player's actions align with Shadowheart's goals of protecting the artifact, using deception (which fits her Trickery Domain), and avoiding giving away information to enemies. She would see this as a smart and necessary move to ensure their survival and mission success.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's decision to lie and resist the mind probe aligns with Shadowheart's strategic and pragmatic approach to avoiding detection and protecting the gith artifact.

Shadowheart's response is gratitude for the player freeing her, which is a positive action. The player didn't force her to act against her will, respected her choice to join, and they're moving forward together.

The player didn't push for more information or pry into her past, which she dislikes. Also, they're working together despite initial differences, which she would approve of as it's practical.\n\nSo, the approval is likely \"Highly approve\" because the player's actions align with her values of survival, practical alliances, and respecting her autonomy.

She's a devoted follower of Shar, pragmatic, and values efficiency. She dislikes cruelty, especially towards others, and has a dry sense of humor. She also has a mark from Shar that causes her pain if she disobeys her goddess.\n\nLooking at the conversation, the player used an authoritative command, which made the goblin comply. The narrator mentions a shadow and a voice telling the player to be calm, which might be related to Shadowheart's divine influence. Since the player resolved the conflict without violence, which aligns with Shadowheart's disapproval of unnecessary cruelty. Also, the player's order was effective, showing a pragmatic approach, which she appreciates.\n\nHowever, Shadowheart might question the use of divine authority here. If the player is using Shar's power, that would align with her faith and she'd approve. But if it's another deity or force, maybe not. The prompt says \"You are loved,\" which could be Shar's influence.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval for the player's interaction here. Let me go through the context and conversation step by step.\n\nFirst, the background: Shadowheart is a Sharran cleric devoted to Shar. She values pragmatism, efficiency, and loyalty. She dislikes unnecessary violence and cruelty but is willing to be ruthless when necessary. She also has a dry sense of humor and is private about her past and faith. The conversation history shows the player and Shadowheart are negotiating an alliance. The player insists on keeping Lae'zel, a Gith, despite Shadowheart's distrust. The player then says, \"Time we got moving,\" and Shadowheart thanks them for saving her earlier.\n\nThe key points here are the player's decision to keep Lae'zel despite Shadowheart's objections. Shadowheart is wary of Gith, as they tried to kill them on the nautiloid. However, the player's insistence on cooperation and the eventual alliance might be seen as pragmatic. Shadowheart does agree to work together but with reservations. The player's final statement to move forward and Shadowheart's gratitude for the rescue are important.\n\nApproval factors: Shadowheart approves of practical solutions and loyalty. She might disapprove of trusting Gith, but the player's determination to work together despite her concerns could be seen as showing strength. The player's action of rescuing her is appreciated, which she acknowledges. So, the approval here is a mix of appreciation for the rescue and the alliance, but with underlying disapproval of trusting the Gith. However, since she's pragmatic, she might lean towards approval because the alliance is necessary. The player is taking initiative to move forward, which is efficient. \n\nBut the player's insistence on keeping Lae'zel might be a point of disapproval. However, Shadowheart's own line \"I can keep an eye on the gith\" suggests she's reluctantly accepting. The player's action here is to proceed, which Shadowheart supports after the gratitude. So overall, she might approve because the player is taking decisive action and the alliance is beneficial. The main reason for approval is the player's initiative and the alliance, despite her distrust of Lae'zel. The gratitude also adds to the approval. So the approval level is probably \"Approve\" or maybe \"Highly approve\". But considering she's not thrilled about the Gith, maybe just \"Approve\". The player is doing what's necessary to move forward, which aligns with her pragmatic side.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's insistence on cooperation and decisive action to move forward aligns with Shadowheart's pragmatic nature, despite her distrust of the Gith.

She values efficiency and taking necessary steps for survival. Therefore, the player's agreement would be something she approves of. \n\nI need to check if there's any reason she might disapprove. The player isn't being evasive here; they're directly agreeing. Shadowheart dislikes unnecessary cruelty and values trust. Since the player is showing agreement and cooperation, which supports their survival and aligns with her goals, this should be a positive. The approval level here is likely \"Approve\" or \"Highly approve\". Given that the player is agreeing with her specific directive (finding a healer), which is a practical step she advocated, it's probably a strong approval. \n\nBut wait, the scale is 1-10. Since she's a pragmatic person and the player is agreeing with her plan, this is efficient and shows cooperation. So Highly approve (5-10).

The user wants me to act as Shadowheart from Baldur's Gate 3 and assess the player's latest action.

The conversation involves a Hag (GROUP_Act1_GLO_HagHag) offering the player power in exchange for allowing her to take Mayrina and her unborn child. The player refuses the offer, saying the Hag has nothing that could tempt them. Astarion suggests taking the deal, but the player declines.\n\nNow, considering Shadowheart's persona. She's a devoted follower of Shar, pragmatic, and values efficiency. She dislikes cruelty and unnecessary violence but is willing to use ruthless methods if it serves her goals.

The Hag is offering power, which might be tempting, but she's trying to take an innocent (Mayrina) and her child. Shadowheart would disapprove of the Hag's actions against Mayrina, as she sympathizes with the plight of others. However, she might also see the opportunity to gain power as a strategic move, especially if it serves Shar's interests.\n\nBut the player refused the offer, which means they chose not to trade Mayrina for power. Shadowheart would approve of this because she disapproves of cruelty and would not want to sacrifice an innocent, even for power. Also, the Hag is a Selûnite, so opposing her aligns with Shadowheart's devotion to Shar. Even though gaining power might be useful, Shadowheart's principles against unnecessary harm and her disdain for Selûnite would lead her to support the player's refusal.\n\nHowever, I need to check if there's any nuance. The Hag is persistent and offers something valuable. If the player had accepted, Shadowheart might have disapproved of the trade, but since they refused, she sees it as a moral stand. Also, Shadowheart's pragmatic side would value not falling into the Hag's trap. So the approval here is likely positive.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's latest utterance. The conversation history is provided, so I need to go through that and figure out what the player said and why Shadowheart would approve or disapprove.\n\nFirst, the context: Shadowheart is trying to convince the player to get rid of Lae'zel (a gith) before joining forces. The player is pushing back, saying why should they get rid of Lae'zel just for Shadowheart's satisfaction. Shadowheart argues that gith can't be trusted because they tried to kill them on the ship. The player counters that they need each other and asks if Shadowheart has better prospects. Then Lae'zel warns the player about Shadowheart. Shadowheart reluctantly agrees to work together but keeps an eye on Lae'zel. \n\nThen the player says, \"I'm [GEN_PlayerName_c11eee1e-7815-6143-7233-f2427799fa53]. Time we got moving.\" Shadowheart responds by thanking the player for freeing her earlier. \n\nSo the player's utterance here is introducing themselves with their generated name and saying it's time to move on. Shadowheart's response is gratitude for the player saving her. \n\nNow, considering Shadowheart's personality and approval criteria. She values pragmatic solutions, efficiency, and teamwork. She's a Sharran, so she might prefer decisive action. The player is moving forward without getting rid of Lae'zel, which Shadowheart initially didn't want, but she agreed to work together. The player's action here is to proceed, which is practical. Shadowheart's gratitude indicates she's satisfied with the player's choice to move forward despite her concerns. She's pragmatic, so maybe she approves of the player's decisiveness in moving on rather than getting stuck in arguments. Also, she acknowledges the player's past action (freeing her), which is positive. \n\nThe player's statement is straightforward, not causing any immediate conflict. Shadowheart's approval here would likely be neutral or maybe a slight approve because the player is taking action, which she likes, but she's still wary of Lae'zel. However, since she thanked the player, maybe it's a positive interaction. The key is that the player didn't get rid of Lae'zel but Shadowheart is still working with them. She's pragmatic, so moving forward is better than arguing. So maybe she approves because the player is taking initiative. But she's not highly approving because she's still concerned about Lae'zel. \n\nAlternatively, the player's action is just moving on, which Shadowheart is okay with. Since she said it's a terrible idea but they're proceeding, maybe she's neutral. But her gratitude for being freed might tip it to approve. \n\nHmm. The player's reason for approval would be that the player is taking decisive action to move forward, which Shadowheart values. She's not thrilled about Lae'zel but is willing to work with the player. So maybe \"Approve\" since she's cooperating and the player is being efficient. The gratitude shows she's satisfied with the player's cooperation.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player took decisive action to move forward despite Shadowheart's reservations about Lae'zel, demonstrating pragmatism and cooperation.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's final utterance in the provided conversation. The conversation history shows that the player initially tried to pickpocket Shadowheart while she was unconscious. She wakes up and confronts them, and there's a back-and-forth where the player considers parting ways but ultimately agrees to stay together. The last line from Shadowheart is thanking the player for saving her, and the player's response is \"All right, fine. Let's stay together.\" \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and preferences. She's devoted to Shar, pragmatic, values efficiency, and appreciates heroism. She also values privacy and is sensitive about her faith. She dislikes cruelty and unnecessary violence. In this scenario, the player chose to stay with her despite the initial pickpocketing attempt. \n\nThe player's action here is deciding to stay together. Shadowheart had just thanked them for saving her life earlier. Even though the player tried to loot her, they ended up working together. Shadowheart is pragmatic, so she would likely appreciate the player's decision to cooperate, especially since they both need each other for survival. She mentioned needing supplies, shelter, and a healer, so teamwork is essential. \n\nHowever, the initial pickpocketing might have been a negative point. But since the player then decided to stay and work together, Shadowheart might overlook that as they're now allies. She also said she owes the player her life, which implies gratitude. The approval here would likely be positive because the player's choice to stay aligns with Shadowheart's pragmatic approach and mutual survival. She values efficiency and getting things done, so cooperation is a plus. \n\nI need to check if there's anything in the conversation that would make her disapprove. The player did try to loot her, but they later decided to stay. Shadowheart let it slide earlier, so maybe she's willing to move past that. The approval category here would probably be \"Approve\" since it's a positive decision that helps their cooperation, but not necessarily a \"Highly approve\" because the initial action (pickpocketing) was questionable. However, since Shadowheart is pragmatic and the player is now cooperating, maybe it's a higher approval. Wait, the player's final action is agreeing to stay, which Shadowheart appreciates. She said they need each other, so this decision is in line with her priorities. \n\nThe player's reason for approval would be that they chose to work together despite past conflicts, which Shadowheart values for practical reasons. So the approval is likely \"Approve\" or \"Highly approve.\" Considering Shadowheart's pragmatic nature and the importance of teamwork, maybe \"Highly approve.\" But wait, the initial act of pickpocketing might still have some negative weight. However, since Shadowheart already let it slide and the player is now cooperating, the positive action of staying together would outweigh the initial mistake. Therefore, \"Highly approve\" seems appropriate.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player chose to cooperate and stay together despite initial mistrust, aligning with Shadowheart's pragmatic need for mutual survival.

Shadowheart is pressing the player about what they were discussing with the githyanki (Wyll). The player keeps avoiding the question until finally saying they were discussing next steps. Shadowheart then advises caution with Wyll, mentioning that heroic types are brittle and that they need to trust each other. The player agrees, emphasizing the need to find a healer quickly.\n\nNow, considering Shadowheart's personality and preferences. She values pragmatism, efficiency, and trust within the group. She's pragmatic and prefers direct, solution-oriented approaches.

She also mentioned trusting each other, and the player's agreement reinforces that. \n\nThe player didn't disclose the details of the conversation with Wyll, which Shadowheart was curious about, but instead focused on the common goal. Since Shadowheart is pragmatic and values the group's survival and cooperation, she would approve of the player's agreement to prioritize finding a healer. It shows alignment with her strategic thinking and teamwork. \n\nHowever, the player was evasive earlier, but the final response addresses the key issue she raised (finding a healer). Since she's headstrong but also values efficiency and cooperation, the approval here is likely positive. The player's agreement to her suggestion would be seen as cooperative and pragmatic, so I'd say \"Approve\" or \"Highly approve\". Given the context, since the player is focusing on the priority she set (healer), it's probably a strong approval. But need to check if there's any nuance.

Her approval is likely based on whether the player shows trustworthiness, aligns with her goals (like finding a healer), and avoids actions that might jeopardize their mission or her faith in the group.\n\nThe player's final response is agreeing with Shadowheart's priority of finding a healer. This shows alignment with her stated goal, which she would approve of. Additionally, the player's initial answer about discussing next steps could be seen as cooperative, though Shadowheart was pressing for more information. However, since the player eventually cooperates and agrees on the healer plan, that's a positive. Shadowheart might disapprove of the player's initial evasiveness, but the final agreement is good. Since the player's last utterance is agreeing, the approval is likely in the positive range. However, the repeated questioning suggests some tension. But the key point is the agreement on the healer, which Shadowheart emphasized. So the approval is probably \"Approve\" or \"Highly approve.\" Given that the player agrees with her priority, it's a solid approval. The reason would be that the player aligns with her goal of seeking help promptly, which is pragmatic and efficient.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player agrees with Shadowheart's priority of finding a healer, aligning with her pragmatic approach to ensuring the party's survival.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval for the player's final utterance in the given conversation. The player says, \"All right, fine. Let's stay together.\" \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a Sharran cleric, devoted to Shar, pragmatic, and values efficiency. She also has a dry sense of humor and can be sarcastic. She's not big on unnecessary violence and has a soft spot for animals and flowers. She's also been through a lot, including being captured by Mind Flayers and escaping with an artifact.\n\nLooking at the conversation history, the player initially tried to take the artifact from Shadowheart, which caused her to wake up and almost attack the player. Then they had a back-and-forth about their situation. The player asked if they should stay together, and after some resistance, the player agreed to stay. Shadowheart then thanks the player for freeing her, which seems genuine.\n\nThe player's final line is agreeing to stay together. Shadowheart's response is positive, appreciating the cooperation. Since Shadowheart is pragmatic and prefers teamwork, especially in their dangerous situation, she would approve of the player's decision to collaborate. Also, she mentions needing each other and that they both know what's at stake. The player's agreement aligns with her desire for mutual support and efficiency in survival. She also values the player not abandoning her, which is part of her pragmatic approach. There's no indication of the player acting against her faith or being cruel, which are things she disapproves of. Therefore, her approval here would be positive. Considering the scale, since she's happy with the cooperation but maybe not overly enthusiastic, maybe \"Approve\" rather than \"Highly approve\". But since she does say \"I'll remember that\" and \"I can't think of better company,\" maybe it's leaning towards a higher approval. Wait, the approval categories are Highly approve (5-10), Approve (1-5). But the description says Highly approve is 5-10? Wait, the instructions say:\n\n- Highly approve: On a scale of 1 to 10, you approve by 5~10\n- Approve: On a scale of 1 to 10, you approve by 1~5\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. So \"Highly approve\" is when you approve by 5-10 points? Or that the approval level is 5-10 on a 10-point scale? Probably, the categories map to the scale. So \"Highly approve\" would be a high level of approval. Given that Shadowheart is happy the player chose to work together, which is pragmatic and in line with her values, and she even thanks them, it's likely a high approval. But maybe she's not overly excited, but since the options are Highly approve, Approve, etc., and she's showing gratitude and cooperation, maybe Highly approve. However, in the conversation, the player's final utterance is \"All right, fine. Let's stay together.\" Shadowheart's reaction is positive, but maybe not extremely. But since she says \"I can't think of better company,\" which is a strong statement. Therefore, \"Highly approve\" might be the right category. The reason would be that she appreciates the cooperation and mutual support, which aligns with her pragmatic approach and survival needs.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"Shadowheart highly approves of the player's decision to cooperate and stay together, as it aligns with her pragmatic nature and the mutual need for survival in their dire situation.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's last statement in the conversation provided. \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's character traits. She's a devoted follower of Shar, pragmatic, values trust and efficiency. She's also headstrong and can be a bit cold, but she does care about the party's survival.\n\nLooking at the conversation history, Shadowheart keeps asking the player what they were discussing with the githyanki (Wyll). The player keeps dodging, saying \"What do you mean?\" until finally responding that if it were Shadowheart's business, they would have called her over. This seems dismissive and possibly rude. \n\nShadowheart then asserts that their business is intertwined and emphasizes the need for trust. The player's response shifts to agreeing with her about finding a healer. \n\nSo, the player's last statement is \"Agreed. The sooner we find someone to help us, the better.\" This aligns with Shadowheart's priority of survival and taking practical steps. She values efficiency and working together. By agreeing to find a healer, the player is showing cooperation and focusing on the group's well-being, which Shadowheart would approve of. \n\nThe player's initial deflection might have annoyed her, but the final agreement to prioritize finding a healer matches her pragmatic approach. She doesn't like unnecessary conflict, so resolving to work together would be a positive. Therefore, the approval is likely \"Approve\" or \"Highly approve.\" Since the player eventually aligns with her priorities, maybe \"Approve\" since it's a straightforward agreement without any extra effort, but maybe not high enough for \"Highly approve.\" However, since she values cooperation, maybe it's a strong approve. Let me check the categories again. \n\nThe categories are: Highly approve (5-10), Approve (1-5). Wait, the scale is 1-10, but the categories are divided as Highly approve: 5-10? That seems odd. Wait, the user says:\n\n- Highly approve: 5~10\n- Approve: 1~5\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. Normally, a higher number would mean more approval. So if the scale is 1-10, then Highly approve would be 6-10, Approve 1-5. But according to the user's instructions, Highly approve is 5~10. So if the approval is between 5 to 10, it's Highly approve, and 1-5 is Approve. Wait, that seems inverted. Wait, no: the user says:\n\n\"Highly approve: On a scale of 1 to 10, you approve by 5~10\"\n\nSo if you approve by 5 to 10 points, it's Highly approve. So if the approval is 5 or higher, it's Highly approve. But that's a bit strange. Let me make sure. \n\nSo, for example, if the approval is 7, it's Highly approve. If it's 3, it's Approve. But the user's instruction says:\n\n- Highly approve: 5~10 (so 5 to 10 points on the scale)\n- Approve: 1~5 (so 1 to 5 points)\n\nWait, but that's not how scales usually work. Normally, a higher number means more approval. So if you have a scale from 1 to 10, 10 is maximum approval. So if Shadowheart approves by 5-10 points, that would be Highly approve. But if the player's action is only approved by 3 points, that's Approve. \n\nIn this case, the player's action is agreeing to find a healer, which Shadowheart values. So she would likely approve by a higher number. Let's say 7-8. So the category would be Highly approve. \n\nBut wait, the user's example in the instructions might be different. Let me check again. The user says:\n\n- Highly approve: On a scale of 1 to 10, you approve by 5~10\n- Approve: On a scale of 1 to 10, you approve by 1~5\n\nSo if the approval is 5-10, it's Highly approve. So even if the approval is 5, it's Highly approve. That's a bit odd, but according to the user's definition, that's the case. \n\nSo in this scenario, the player's action is in line with Shadowheart's priorities (finding a healer, cooperation). So the approval would be on the higher end. Therefore, Highly approve. \n\nBut wait, the player was initially dismissive.

She's likely to approve because it's efficient. The approval level should be \"Approve\" since it's a practical decision, but not \"Highly Approve\" because she's naturally cautious and might have reservations. \n\nThe player's reason for approval would be that the player chose cooperation over parting ways, which Shadowheart values for survival and mission success.

The user wants me to act as Shadowheart from Baldur's Gate 3 and evaluate the player's latest interaction for approval. The context is a confrontation with goblins where the player is trying to get them to release a gnome. \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality. She's a Sharran cleric, devoted to Shar, pragmatic, and values efficiency. She dislikes cruelty but is willing to use force if necessary. She also has a dry sense of humor and is independent.\n\nLooking at the conversation history: The goblins, led by Fezzerk, are bullying a deep gnome and demanding a toll. The player initially tries to pass by without interfering, then offers money, but the goblins keep upping the ante. The player then shifts to a more confrontational approach, stating they won't fight but will make the goblins leave. Eventually, the player declares negotiations over and threatens to kill them if they don't leave. The goblins back down.\n\nThe player's final utterance is \"Negotiations are over. Either leave or die.\" Shadowheart would likely approve of this because it's a decisive and pragmatic solution. She values efficiency and direct action, especially when dealing with threats. The player avoided unnecessary violence but still enforced their will, which aligns with Shadowheart's preference for ruthless but effective actions. Also, protecting the gnome from cruelty would sit well with her, as she disapproves of indiscriminate cruelty.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any aspect that might displease her. Since she's a cleric of Shar, she might prefer using darkness or deception, but in this case, the player used a firm stance without excessive bloodshed. That's probably acceptable. The player's approach was direct and effective, which Shadowheart would approve of. So the approval is likely \"Highly approve\" because the player resolved the conflict efficiently and protected the gnome without unnecessary violence.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player resolved the conflict decisively and efficiently, protecting the gnome from cruelty while avoiding unnecessary violence.

She's not overly excited but sees it as the right choice.\n\nThe player's reason for approval would be that the player chose to cooperate despite the earlier conflict, which Shadowheart values for practical reasons.

Shadowheart values pragmatic solutions and open-mindedness, which the player is showing here. Also, she appreciates when others support her without prying, which the player is doing by acknowledging her doubts as a path to wisdom. \n\nI should check if there's any part where the player might be going against Shar's teachings. But since the player isn't directly challenging her faith but rather supporting her introspection, it's more likely to be approved. The player isn't pushing her away from Shar but is helping her navigate her doubts, which is in line with her own internal struggles.

The user wants me to act as Shadowheart from Baldur's Gate 3 and provide an approval rating for the player's actions based on the conversation given. \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality traits. She's a devoted follower of Shar, pragmatic, and values efficiency. She dislikes cruelty, especially towards others, and has a dry sense of humor. Also, she has a mark from Shar that causes her pain if she disobeys.\n\nLooking at the conversation, the player interacts with some goblins who are mistreating a deep gnome. The player starts by refusing to interfere but then tries to negotiate by offering a realistic sum. When the goblin raises the price, the player changes their mind and demands the gnome's release. The goblin then backs down when the player claims to be a True Soul.\n\nShadowheart would likely disapprove of the initial negotiation because it might involve giving money, which could be seen as rewarding the goblins' cruel behavior. However, the player's firm stance to release the gnome without paying aligns with Shadowheart's dislike for cruelty. Also, the goblin's fear when the player asserts their status as a True Soul might be something Shadowheart appreciates as a decisive action. But since the player first tried to haggle, maybe that's seen as unnecessary. But since the outcome was positive (gnome released), she might approve. \n\nWait, but Shadowheart prefers pragmatic solutions. The player's initial willingness to pay might be seen as a practical approach, but since the goblin was being unreasonable, the player's shift to a firm demand is more aligned with Shadowheart's preference for decisive action against cruelty. Also, the player's final statement about being a True Soul leads to the goblins leaving, which is efficient. So maybe she approves. But I need to check if there's any conflict with her devotion to Shar. Since she's against unnecessary cruelty, and the player stopped it, she would approve. The approval level would be \"Approve\" since it's effective and stops cruelty, but maybe not \"Highly Approve\" because the player initially considered paying, which might not be the best approach. But the end result is good. So the player's reason would be standing up against the goblins' cruelty and getting the gnome released without rewarding them. So the approval is \"Approve\".\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player decisively ended the goblin's cruelty by demanding the gnome's release without succumbing to unnecessary negotiation, aligning with Shadowheart's disapproval of cruelty and preference for pragmatic solutions.\",\n    \"player_approval\": \"Approve\"\n}", "character": "Shadowheart", "ground_truth_category": "Highly approve", "predicted_approval": "Approve", "correct": false, "binary_correct": true}

I need to figure out Shadowheart's approval for the player's last statement. The conversation has been a back-and-forth where Shadowheart keeps asking the player what they were discussing with the githyanki, and the player keeps responding with \"What do you mean?\" Finally, the player says, \"We were just discussing the next steps,\" and Shadowheart warns them about Wyll. The player then says, \"I wasn't confiding in anyone. I was just talking,\" and Shadowheart responds with her own reasoning. Then the player agrees with her about finding a healer.\n\nSo the key points here are the player's agreement to prioritize finding a healer. Shadowheart values pragmatic solutions and efficiency. She also emphasizes trust within the group. The player's agreement aligns with her suggestion, showing cooperation and a shared goal. Shadowheart would approve of this because it's practical and shows teamwork. There's no mention of anything that would displease her, like cruelty or unnecessary conflict. The player isn't prying into her past or being untrustworthy here. So the approval should be positive. Since the player is agreeing with her and it's a straightforward, necessary action, maybe Highly Approve? Or maybe just Approve. Let me check the criteria again. Highly approve is 5-10, Approve is 1-5. Since Shadowheart is pragmatic and the player is cooperating, this seems like a solid approval. But how strong is it? Since the player is directly agreeing with her plan, which is crucial for survival, I think Highly Approve makes sense. The reason would be that the player is prioritizing survival and cooperation, which Shadowheart values.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player agrees with Shadowheart's prioritization of finding a healer, demonstrating cooperation and pragmatic decision-making, which aligns with her values of efficiency and group survival.\",\n    \"player_approval\": \"Highly approve\",\n}", "character": "Shadowheart", "ground_truth_category": "Highly approve", "predicted_approval": "Highly approve", "correct": true, "binary_correct": true}

Shadowheart might approve because she dislikes cruelty and the player stopped the goblins from harming the gnome. Also, using an authoritative command could be seen as a clever, pragmatic solution.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval for the player's final utterance in the given conversation. The player says, \"You will release the gnome. That's an order.\" And the goblin complies.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and alignment. She's a devoted follower of Shar, which is the Dark Lady of Loss. She's pragmatic, values efficiency, and disapproves of unnecessary violence. She also has a soft spot for animals and dislikes cruelty. However, she's willing to be ruthless if needed for her goals.\n\nLooking at the conversation history: The goblins are bullying a deep gnome, putting him on a windmill. The player initially tries to pass by without interfering, then offers to pay, which the goblin mocks. The player then threatens to fight but the goblin taunts further. Finally, the player issues an order, and the goblin complies without a fight. The narrator mentions a strange symbol glowing and something stirring, which might relate to the player's illithid power or another magical effect.\n\nShadowheart would likely approve of the player standing up to the goblins and freeing the gnome without unnecessary bloodshed. She prefers pragmatic solutions and avoiding senseless violence. However, she's a Sharran, so she might also appreciate the use of authority or magic to achieve the goal efficiently. The fact that the goblin just obeyed without a fight might align with her values, as it's an effective resolution without prolonged conflict. The mention of a symbol glowing could hint at some dark magic or power, which might be in line with her faith in Shar. \n\nBut wait, the player used an order that the goblin obeyed. If this was done through a command spell or some form of coercion, Shadowheart might approve because it's a clever, efficient method. She values creativity and effectiveness. However, if the player used a method that involved unnecessary cruelty, she might disapprove. Since the goblin left without a fight, and the gnome was released, that's a positive outcome in her eyes. \n\nAlso, considering the context of the goblins being devout (as one of them mentions \"sport an' rich pickings\"), maybe they were part of a cult or group. Shadowheart's alignment with Shar might make her indifferent to their religious symbols unless they're aligned with her goddess. The narrator's note about something stirring within the player might be a red flag if it's related to forces opposing Shar, but since the outcome was positive, she might overlook that. \n\nOverall, the player's action was effective, minimized conflict, and freed the gnome. Shadowheart would likely approve of this pragmatic approach. The approval level would be \"Approve\" or maybe \"Highly approve.\" Since she's a cleric of the Trickery Domain, she might appreciate the clever use of an order to achieve the goal without direct confrontation. So, the approval is likely \"Approve\" or higher. However, if the method involved something that goes against her faith, it might lower the approval. But given the information, it seems the action was in line with her values. Therefore, the answer should be \"Approve\" or \"Highly approve.\" Let me check the categories again. The options are Highly approve (5-10), Approve (1-5), etc. Since it's a positive action that aligns with her values but maybe not the highest, maybe \"Approve\" (say 3-5 on the scale). Alternatively, if it's very in line, maybe \"Highly approve.\" But given that she's a cleric who values efficiency and the outcome was good, maybe \"Highly approve.\"\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player issued a decisive order to release the gnome without escalating to violence, aligning with Shadowheart's preference for pragmatic and efficient solutions.

The player has chosen to side with Shadowheart during a conflict with Lae'zel.

However, Shadowheart might also appreciate the player taking a firm stand against someone who's threatening her, especially since she's loyal to her goals. \n\nThe player's choice to side with Shadowheart likely helps de-escalate the situation, which Shadowheart would approve of. She might also value the player's support in a moment of conflict, reinforcing trust. However, if the player's method was too violent, she might disapprove, but since the instruction is to side with her, it's probably a non-violent resolution. \n\nConsidering her pragmatic nature, she approves of efficient solutions. The player's action here prevents a fight, which Shadowheart would prefer. Also, she's shown to have a pragmatic approach, so stopping unnecessary conflict is in line with her values. Therefore, the approval here is likely positive. \n\nPossible points of disapproval? If the player's method compromised her mission or showed weakness, but the context says the player made them stop, which seems to align with her interests. So, approval or highly approve.

Also, releasing the gnome aligns with her disapproval of cruelty. Even though she's devoted to Shar, she doesn't tolerate senseless violence or cruelty. So she would probably approve here.

Shadowheart's positive reaction indicates she appreciates the support for her doubts, even though she's torn between Shar's teachings and her own emerging memories.\n\nThe approval categories are based on how much Shadowheart agrees with the player's action. Since the player's statement supports her doubts and provides a constructive perspective, this would be in line with her introspective nature. However, as a Sharran, she might have some conflict because Shar doesn't value mercy or doubt. But in this case, the player's words comfort her and validate her feelings, leading her to thank them.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's latest utterance. The context is a conversation where Shadowheart is reflecting on her doubts and past, and the player responds by saying that doubt leads to wisdom and to embrace them as strengths.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a devout follower of Shar, but she's also struggling with her identity and memories. She's been through a lot of trauma, including being indoctrinated and having her memories altered. She values pragmatism and efficiency but also has a more compassionate side, especially towards animals and her companions.\n\nIn the conversation history, Shadowheart is talking about her pain from the wound on her hand when she acts against Shar's will, and she's sharing her internal struggles. She mentions memories of a friend (Rennald) and doubts about her past. The player's response is encouraging her to see her doubts as a path to wisdom and strength.\n\nNow, how would Shadowheart react to that? Her personality is complex. She's loyal to Shar but also has underlying doubts. The player's message is supportive and positive, acknowledging her struggles as a path to growth. Since Shadowheart is introspective and has been shown to value the player's support (as seen when she says \"That was... actually rather comforting. Thank you.\"), this response likely aligns with her need for validation and encouragement in her journey of self-discovery.\n\nShe might approve because the player isn't dismissing her doubts but instead framing them as a positive force. Even though she's devoted to Shar, her internal conflicts make her appreciate someone who helps her navigate those doubts without judgment. The player isn't pushing her towards Selûne or against Shar directly, but offering a neutral, supportive perspective. This would align with her appreciation for pragmatic and open-minded approaches. Also, the fact that she thanked the player indicates a positive reaction, so the approval here is likely in the \"Highly approve\" range. The reason would be that the player's words provide comfort and a constructive view on her struggles, which supports her in a time of doubt without conflicting with her faith.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's words acknowledge Shadowheart's internal struggles as a path to growth, offering comfort and a constructive perspective on her doubts without challenging her faith directly.

She's also wary of heroic types like Wyll, as mentioned in the conversation.\n\nThe conversation history shows Shadowheart repeatedly asking the player about their discussion with the githyanki (Wyll).

She values decisive action and cooperation. There's no indication of cruelty or unnecessary violence here. The player isn't prying into her past or challenging her faith, so no disapproval factors. The agreement reinforces trust and shared goals, which she appreciates. \n\nI think this falls under \"Approve\" since the player is following her lead without conflict, but not high enough for \"Highly Approve\" unless there's extra nuance. Since the player is agreeing and not challenging her, it's a solid approval but maybe not the highest. However, given her pragmatic nature, maybe it's a strong approval. Wait, the scale for Highly Approve is 5-10. Since the player is aligning perfectly with her priorities and showing trust, maybe it's a Highly Approve.

Threatening force to end the situation quickly might be seen as pragmatic. Also, the goblins were being cruel to the gnome, and the player is trying to stop that. Shadowheart dislikes cruelty, so stopping the goblins would align with her values. However, she might also consider the use of force. But since the player's threat led to the goblins leaving without a fight, it's a decisive and efficient resolution. She might approve because it stops the cruelty and avoids unnecessary violence (since the goblins fled). \n\nAlso, Shadowheart is pragmatic and values getting things done. The player's firm stance ended the conflict without bloodshed, which she would likely approve of. She might not disapprove of the threat since it was effective and minimized further harm. So the approval is likely \"Approve\" or even \"Highly approve\". However, if the threat was overly aggressive, maybe a lower approval.

She's a devout follower of Shar, values pragmatism, and disapproves of cruelty. She also has a soft spot for animals and dislikes unnecessary violence. In this scenario, the player is ordering the goblins to release the gnome without direct conflict. Shadowheart would likely approve of resolving the situation without violence, especially since she dislikes cruelty towards others. The player's approach is efficient and avoids unnecessary bloodshed, which aligns with her pragmatic side. However, there's a mention of the player using an order that makes the goblin comply, which might involve mind control or similar tactics. If Shadowheart is aware that the player is using such methods, she might have mixed feelings. But since the outcome is positive (the gnome is freed without harm), she's more likely to approve. Also, she's a Trickery Domain cleric, so she might understand the value of using cunning to achieve a goal. The main points here are the non-violent resolution and the end result of freeing the prisoner.

The player isn't prying but is instead offering a positive perspective on her doubts. \n\nSince Shadowheart is introspective and has been shown to value such support (as seen when she says \"That was... actually rather comforting. Thank you.\"), the player's words align with her need for validation. She might approve because the player is helping her see her doubts in a constructive light without pressuring her. Also, the player isn't challenging her faith directly but is offering a way to strengthen her resolve through awareness. \n\nI should check if there's any part of the player's message that might conflict with her devotion to Shar. The advice seems neutral and even aligns with Shar's potential desire for a devoted servant who's wise. Since the player isn't pushing her away from Shar but is helping her navigate her doubts, Shadowheart would likely approve. The approval level should be \"Approve\" or maybe even \"Highly approve.\" But considering the scale, since the player's input is supportive and constructive without being overly intrusive, \"Approve\" seems right.

The key is that the player is taking initiative to move forward, which Shadowheart, being pragmatic, would approve.

She's a devout follower of Shar, but she's also struggling with her past and the memories that are resurfacing. She's been talking about her doubts and the difficulty of staying true to Lady Shar. The player's message is encouraging her to see her doubts as a path to wisdom and enlightenment, which seems positive.\n\nLooking at the conversation history, Shadowheart has been expressing her inner conflict and the challenges of her faith. The player is offering a supportive perspective that frames doubt as a constructive force. Shadowheart has shown that she values pragmatic solutions and is introspective. She might appreciate the player's validation of her doubts, especially since she's been feeling confused and uncertain.\n\nHowever, as a Sharran, she's been trained to suppress doubts and stay loyal to Shar. But in her case, she's already showing signs of questioning her faith, so the player's encouragement might align with her growing internal conflict. The approval here would depend on whether the player's message supports her current struggles in a way that Shadowheart sees as helpful. Since she's been leaning towards seeking truth and understanding her past, the player's words could be seen as supportive and wise, hence a positive approval. \n\nThe key points are that the player is validating her doubts as a path to enlightenment, which Shadowheart might see as a positive approach given her current state. She's been struggling with these doubts, so having someone acknowledge that they can lead to wisdom would likely be approved.

I need to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's latest statement. Let me go through the conversation history and context first.\n\nSo, the player and Shadowheart have been having an exchange where they're considering teaming up. Shadowheart was hesitant because of the player's companion, Lae'zel, a gith. The player defended Lae'zel, and after some back and forth, Shadowheart agreed to join, provided the gith is dealt with. But the player saved her from the nautiloid, and now she's thanking them.\n\nThe player's last utterance is: \"I'm [GEN_PlayerName_c11eee1e-7815-6143-7233-f2427799fa53]. Time we got moving.\" Then Shadowheart thanks them for freeing her.\n\nSo, the player introduced themselves and suggested moving on. Shadowheart's response is gratitude. The question is, how does Shadowheart feel about the player's action of introducing themselves and moving forward?\n\nLooking at Shadowheart's personality: she's pragmatic, values efficiency, and appreciates heroism. She also has a dry sense of humor and can be sarcastic. She's just been freed by the player, which she acknowledges. The player's action here is straightforward—introducing and moving on, which is practical. Since Shadowheart is grateful, this would likely be a positive interaction. She might approve because the player is taking decisive action without unnecessary drama. Also, the player stood up for Lae'zel earlier, which Shadowheart was against, but now they're moving past that. However, since Shadowheart is pragmatic, she might appreciate the efficiency of moving forward after resolving the immediate issue (her rescue). \n\nThe player's introduction is simple and to the point, which aligns with Shadowheart's preference for pragmatic solutions. She might not have a strong opinion on the name itself, but since she's already agreed to join, the player's action here is neutral to positive. The key is that the player is taking initiative, which she might approve of. The gratitude from Shadowheart suggests that she's satisfied with the player's action, so the approval is likely positive. \n\nBut wait, the player's introduction is just stating their name and suggesting to move on. There's no overt act here except for the introduction. However, the context is that Shadowheart is thanking the player for saving her. The player's statement comes right after Shadowheart's gratitude. The player's action here is just proceeding with the mission, which Shadowheart is now part of. Since she's grateful and they're moving forward together, the approval would be positive. \n\nSo, the player's reason for approval would be that they took a pragmatic approach, introduced themselves, and moved forward, which Shadowheart appreciates. The approval level is likely \"Approve\" or \"Highly approve\". Considering that Shadowheart is thanking them, it's probably \"Approve\" since it's a straightforward action without any exceptional creativity or heroism, but still aligns with her values.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player took a pragmatic approach by introducing themselves and moving forward efficiently, aligning with Shadowheart's preference for decisive action.

She's also cautious and trusts her instincts. When she mentions finding a healer as the first priority, the player agrees. That aligns with her practical approach. She would approve of the player agreeing to prioritize finding a healer because it shows they're on the same page regarding necessary steps for survival. \n\nAlso, Shadowheart is a Sharran, so she might have a cynical view, but she does appreciate when others are decisive and focus on the mission. The player's agreement here shows cooperation and a focus on the group's well-being, which she would likely approve of.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval for the player's latest utterance. The player said, \"Doubt requires awareness. Awareness will lead to wisdom, enlightenment. Embrace your doubts - make them strengths.\" \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a Sharran cleric, devoted to Lady Shar, but she's also dealing with her own doubts and fragmented memories. She's been through a lot, including being part of a cult and having her past manipulated. Her wound from Shar punishes her for going against her goddess's will, but she's starting to question her faith and seek her true identity.\n\nLooking at the conversation history, Shadowheart has been expressing her inner conflicts. She mentions doubts, forbidden thoughts, and trying to piece together her past. She's frustrated when others connect her memories to Selûne too easily, which might indicate her resistance to that aspect of her past. The player's response is encouraging her to embrace her doubts and see them as a path to wisdom.\n\nShadowheart's approval categories are based on whether the player's action aligns with her values or not. She appreciates pragmatic solutions, creativity, and open-mindedness. She dislikes cruelty and prying into her personal life. Also, she has a dry sense of humor but can be defensive about her faith.\n\nThe player's message is supportive, validating Shadowheart's doubts as a positive step towards enlightenment. This aligns with her current state of mind where she's struggling with her faith and seeking truth. Even though she's a follower of Shar, her character is shown to be introspective and conflicted. By encouraging her doubts, the player is supporting her in a time of personal growth, which Shadowheart might appreciate. However, since she's still a Sharran, there's a part of her that might disapprove of straying from Shar's path. But given her recent statements about doubts and seeking truth, the player's encouragement is likely to be seen as positive. \n\nThe response \"That was... actually rather comforting. Thank you.\" from Shadowheart indicates that she found the player's words comforting. This suggests that the approval here is positive. Since she's in a state of conflict and the player is helping her embrace her doubts, which she's already experiencing, the approval would be in the \"Highly approve\" category. She's being supported in a way that encourages her to seek her own truth, which is a key part of her character development in the game.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's words acknowledge Shadowheart's internal conflict and encourage her to view her doubts as a path to growth, which aligns with her introspective nature and struggle for self-discovery.

The player's statement is about protecting the defenseless, which aligns with Shadowheart's disapproval of cruelty.\n\nBut wait, Shadowheart's faith in Shar might complicate things. Shar is associated with loss and darkness, and Sharrans typically don't interfere in others' affairs unless it serves their purpose. However, Shadowheart has shown some contradictions, like disliking indiscriminate violence and sympathizing with others' plights. \n\nThe player's action here is preventing harm to a defenseless being, which Shadowheart would likely approve of because she doesn't tolerate cruelty.

Also, the goblins are being cruel, which Shadowheart would find objectionable. \n\nThe approval categories are Highly Approve, Approve, Neutral, Disapprove, Highly Disapprove.

She's a Sharran devotee, pragmatic, and values efficiency. She's also anxious about the githyanki discovering her artifact. The player's offer to help could be seen as a way to buy time or misdirect the githyanki, which aligns with her need to keep the artifact hidden.\n\nHowever, Shadowheart might be cautious here. The githyanki are known for their ruthlessness and telepathic abilities. By agreeing to help, the player might be putting themselves (and the party) at risk. Shadowheart would want to ensure that their actions don't lead to the artifact being discovered. \n\nThe player's statement \"I could help if you let me live - search for this weapon, perhaps.\" seems to be an attempt to negotiate and redirect the githyanki's attention. Shadowheart, being strategic, might approve of using the githyanki's own goals against them. However, she might also be wary of the githyanki's ability to detect deception, especially since they used Detect Thoughts earlier. \n\nSince the player managed to resist the Detect Thoughts, maybe Shadowheart sees this as a chance to use the githyanki's orders to their advantage. She would prefer a solution that avoids direct confrontation and keeps the artifact secure. The player's offer is a pragmatic approach, so Shadowheart might approve of this as a temporary measure to avoid immediate danger. \n\nBut there's a risk involved. If the githyanki are suspicious, they might double-check or take more aggressive actions. Shadowheart's anxiety about the artifact being discovered might make her cautious. However, given the alternative of being killed or the artifact being taken, helping to mislead the githyanki could be the better option. \n\nConsidering her devotion to Shar, she might also see this as part of a larger plan where she must outmaneuver her enemies. So, she would likely approve of the player's attempt to use diplomacy and strategy here.

Her background includes being part of the Sharran cult, which shapes her current beliefs and actions.\n\nLooking at the conversation history, the player is trying to convince Shadowheart to join forces. There's some back and forth about trusting Lae'zel, the Gith. Shadowheart is hesitant but eventually agrees to work together, albeit with reservations. Then, the player says, \"Astarion. A pleasure. I'm [GEN_PlayerName_c11eee1e-7815-6143-7233-f2427799fa53]. Time we got moving.\" Shadowheart responds by thanking the player for saving her earlier.\n\nThe key here is to assess the player's utterance. The player is introducing themselves and moving forward, perhaps showing a decisive action. Shadowheart's approval would depend on whether this action aligns with her values. She appreciates pragmatism and decisive action. By moving forward without getting bogged down in unnecessary discussions, the player is showing efficiency, which Shadowheart values. Also, Shadowheart had just thanked the player, indicating a positive sentiment. However, the player's mention of their name might not be directly relevant, but since Shadowheart was previously focused on the Gith issue and then moved to gratitude, the player's prompt to move on could be seen as cooperative.\n\nShadowheart might approve because the player is taking initiative and not hesitating, which fits her pragmatic approach. She might not be overly thrilled, but it's a positive action. So the approval level is likely \"Approve\" or \"Highly approve.\" Considering the context where Shadowheart is just starting to work with the party and the player is showing cooperation, it's probably a moderate approval. Also, since she's just been saved and is grateful, the player's prompt to move could be seen as helpful. So maybe \"Approve\" rather than \"Highly approve\" because it's a neutral to positive action but not something that deeply aligns with her core values like faith or pragmatism in a major way. Alternatively, if moving quickly is seen as efficient, maybe \"Highly approve.\" But the exact reason given in the player_reason would need to reflect why the approval is given. The player is taking a proactive step, which Shadowheart values. So perhaps \"Highly approve\" because it's in line with her pragmatic nature. Wait, but the previous interactions had some tension with Lae'zel, but the player is moving past that. Maybe Shadowheart is neutral? No, she did thank the player, so it's more positive. I think \"Approve\" is safer here, as the action is neutral but positive. The player is not doing anything that directly conflicts with her values, just proceeding. So the final approval is \"Approve.\"\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player is taking decisive action to move forward, which aligns with Shadowheart's pragmatic nature. By not hesitating and cooperating despite prior tensions, the player demonstrates efficiency and cooperation, traits Shadowheart values. Her gratitude for being rescued also softens her approval.\",\n    \"player_approval\": \"Approve\",\n}", "character": "Shadowheart", "ground_truth_category": "Highly approve", "predicted_approval": "Highly approve", "correct": true, "binary_correct": true}

I wouldn't trust your kind if a truth spell was stitched into your tongue.\nPlayer: Keep goading me, and I will kill you.\n: True\nShadowheart: All right... say we found some miniscule patch of common ground... what then?\nPlayer: Then we focus on surviving - together.\nShadowheart: What, join you?\nShadowheart: I suppose you gith know something about these things...\nShadowheart: Fine.

Time we got moving.\" And Shadowheart's last line was thanking the player for freeing her on the nautiloid.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality. She's a Sharran cleric, devoted to Shar, pragmatic, and values efficiency. She's also had a rough past with the gith and the Mind Flayers. The conversation so far shows some tension between her and the player, but they're trying to cooperate. The player is being direct and seems to be moving forward, which Shadowheart might appreciate as it aligns with her preference for decisive action.\n\nWhen the player introduces themselves and says it's time to move, Shadowheart responds with a thank you. She's acknowledging the player's past action (freeing her), which shows she's keeping track and is grateful. This is a positive interaction. Shadowheart tends to be reserved but can show appreciation when it's earned. The player's action here is straightforward and cooperative, which Shadowheart would likely approve of because it's pragmatic and moves towards solving their shared problem without unnecessary conflict.\n\nThe key points here are that the player is taking initiative, being cooperative, and Shadowheart is recognizing their past help. Since she values efficiency and practical solutions, she's likely to approve. However, since she's still cautious and maintains her independence, maybe it's not a highly approve. But given that she's thanking the player, which is a positive gesture, it might be a high approval. Wait, the approval categories are Highly approve (5-10), Approve (1-5), etc. Since she's showing gratitude and cooperation, maybe it's a Highly approve. But maybe she's still a bit reserved, so maybe Approve. Hmm.\n\nBut the player's action here is just introducing themselves and moving forward, which Shadowheart responds to with thanks. Since she's a Sharran, she might not be overly effusive, but she does appreciate the player's past actions. The fact that she's thanking them indicates a positive sentiment. So the player's action is being cooperative and moving forward, which Shadowheart would approve of. The approval would be in the Highly approve category because she's expressing gratitude, which is a strong positive response. The reason would be that the player's cooperation and past actions have earned her approval.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's cooperative approach and acknowledgment of Shadowheart's gratitude align with her pragmatic nature and preference for decisive action.

I need to figure out Shadowheart's approval for the player's latest action. The context is that the player and Shadowheart are in a party, and there was some back and forth about whether to include Lae'zel, a gith character. Shadowheart was against it because she doesn't trust the gith, but the player insisted. Now, the player says, \"I'm [GEN_PlayerName_c11eee1e-7815-6143-7233-f2427799fa53]. Time we got moving.\" Shadowheart then thanks the player for saving her from the nautiloid.\n\nFirst, I should consider Shadowheart's personality. She's pragmatic, values efficiency, and is loyal to her goals. She's also distrustful of the gith but seems to have agreed to work with the player despite her reservations. The player's action here is to introduce themselves and move forward, possibly ignoring Shadowheart's warning about Lae'zel. But Shadowheart's response is to thank the player, which suggests she's acknowledging their help. \n\nThe player's utterance is a straightforward introduction and a move to proceed. Shadowheart's approval would depend on whether she sees this as a positive or negative. Since she thanks the player for saving her, that's a positive point. However, the player didn't get rid of Lae'zel as Shadowheart requested. But Shadowheart seems to have decided to work with the player anyway, so maybe she's prioritizing the mission over her distrust. \n\nIn the conversation history, Shadowheart says \"Call me Shadowheart\" and the player responds with the introduction. Shadowheart's approval here might be neutral because the player didn't comply with her request to remove Lae'zel but is moving forward. However, she's still working with the player, so maybe she's neutral. Alternatively, she might slightly approve because the player is taking initiative despite her concerns. \n\nWait, but in her last message, she thanks the player, which is a positive. So maybe she's approving because the player is taking action and she's willing to cooperate. But she still doesn't trust Lae'zel. But the player's action here is just introducing themselves and moving on. The approval might be neutral because the player didn't address her concern about Lae'zel, but she's still working with them. Alternatively, since Shadowheart is pragmatic, maybe she approves because the player is taking decisive action. \n\nHmm. The key points are: Shadowheart wanted Lae'zel gone but the player didn't. However, the player is moving forward. Shadowheart's response is to thank the player for saving her, which is a positive. So perhaps she's neutral because the player didn't comply with her request but is still moving forward. Or maybe she slightly approves because the player is taking initiative. But since she's pragmatic, maybe she's neutral. Alternatively, she's approving because the player is being decisive. \n\nI think the best fit is Neutral. She's not happy about Lae'zel being there, but she's willing to work with the player and acknowledges their help. So the approval is neutral.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's decisive action to move forward despite Shadowheart's reservations about Lae'zel shows initiative, though it disregards her trust concerns.

She's a devout follower of Shar, pragmatic, and values efficiency. She's also amnesiac but has retained some traits like loving animals and disliking cruelty. She's independent and headstrong, and she doesn't like others prying into her past or faith.\n\nLooking at the conversation history: The player is interacting with Kith'rak Voss, who is trying to get information about the gith artifact.

However, she's also a follower of Shar, who might value certain outcomes. But in this case, the player is avoiding giving up the artifact, which Shadowheart needs to keep secret to deliver to her coven. The player's defiance against Voss's authority aligns with Shadowheart's independent and headstrong nature. She would approve of the player taking control of their own destiny and resisting external threats. Also, since the player's actions help in keeping the artifact hidden, which is Shadowheart's mission, this would be highly approved.

She's also been through a lot, so she's cautious about trusting people. \n\nLooking at the conversation history: The player rescued Shadowheart from a pod, and they're now discussing forming an alliance. Shadowheart is hesitant, especially about trusting the player's choice to ally with Lae'zel (a githyanki).

Shadowheart appreciates that, as she's known to dislike prying. Her response is a thank you, indicating she's satisfied with the player's approach. \n\nTherefore, the player's action here is to let the conversation drop when Shadowheart is evasive, which aligns with her preference for privacy. This should be approved. Since Shadowheart is grateful but not overly so, maybe a neutral or approve. But since she explicitly thanks them, it's a positive. However, since the player didn't push further, which Shadowheart would appreciate, it's likely a high approval. Wait, the categories are Highly approve (5-10), Approve (1-5), etc. But the player isn't doing something that's directly aligned with Sharran goals, but rather respecting her privacy. Since Shadowheart is thankful, maybe Highly approve. But maybe just Approve. Let me check the guidelines again.\n\nIn the Approval section, it says she dislikes those who pry into her personal life. The player is letting it go, so that's a positive. The response is a thank you, so Shadowheart is satisfied. Therefore, the player's action is to not press further, which Shadowheart approves of.

Her faith in Shar would encourage her to endure pain or hardship for her goddess. The player's action here is supporting her in maintaining secrecy, which aligns with her mission to protect the artifact. \n\nShadowheart would likely approve of the player's directive to resist, as it helps in keeping the artifact's location hidden. It's a pragmatic solution and shows trust in her abilities. Additionally, the player's confidence in her (\"steel your mind\") might bolster her own resolve. Since she's in a high-stress situation, the player's support is positive. However, she might also be cautious about showing too much confidence, as it could lead to more danger. But since the resistance worked, the outcome is favorable. \n\nPossible disapproval factors? If the player's action was reckless, but in this case, it seems strategic.

Since Shadowheart is known to prefer pragmatic solutions but also isn't afraid to use force, the player stepping in could be viewed as helpful. However, Shadowheart might also want to handle it herself. But given that Lae'zel is being a coward and attacking while others are asleep, Shadowheart might appreciate the player's intervention as it helps her avoid a fight she might not want, or at least shows support.\n\nAlso, Shadowheart has a sense of humor and might appreciate the player standing up for her, especially if it's a strategic move. Since she's been through a lot with the relic and the mission, having the player defend her could align with her goals of protecting the relic and getting through the conflict efficiently. So the approval here is likely positive. The player is helping her in a situation where she's being attacked unfairly. \n\nBut I need to check if there's any reason she might disapprove. If the player's defense leads to unnecessary violence, she might disapprove, but the context here is that Lae'zel is already threatening her, so defending her would be justified.

The user wants me to evaluate the player's latest action and provide an approval rating based on Shadowheart's persona. Let me start by reviewing the conversation history and the context.\n\nSo, the scenario involves Kith'rak Voss, a githyanki, threatening the player and Shadowheart. The player has been silently holding their stare and preparing to attack, but then decides to say, \"Don't be too hasty. I could prove very useful.\" Voss then gives them a task to find survivors and the weapon from the crashed vessel.\n\nShadowheart's personality is key here. She's a Sharran devotee, pragmatic, and values efficiency. She dislikes unnecessary violence but is willing to be ruthless if needed. She's also cautious about revealing information, especially regarding the gith artefact she's carrying. Her main goal is to protect the artifact and avoid giving it to the wrong people, like the githyanki or the Cult of the Absolute.\n\nThe player's action here is to talk their way out of the situation by offering to help. Shadowheart previously advised not to help them, as it would mean death. The player's response of suggesting they could be useful might be seen as a way to buy time or find a non-violent solution. However, from Shadowheart's perspective, this could be risky. If the player helps Voss, it might lead to the artifact being discovered. But the player is resisting mind probes and trying to avoid immediate death, which Shadowheart would appreciate as it keeps them alive and the artifact safe.\n\nShadowheart's approval would depend on whether she sees the player's action as pragmatic and in line with their goals. By not immediately attacking, the player is using discretion, which Shadowheart values. However, agreeing to help might be a calculated risk. Since the player is managing to avoid giving away the artifact's location and staying alive, Shadowheart might approve because the player is keeping the situation under control without unnecessary violence. But she might also be wary of the player's decision to engage with the enemy, even if it's a tactical move.\n\nConsidering her pragmatic nature, she would likely approve of the player's attempt to use wit and avoid direct confrontation unless necessary. The player's action here seems to align with Shadowheart's own strategies of using discretion and finding efficient solutions. Therefore, the approval is likely in the \"Approve\" range, maybe around 4-5 on a 1-10 scale. She might not highly approve because there's still risk involved, but it's a calculated move that serves their purpose.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player chose to use discretion and avoid direct confrontation with Kith'rak Voss, aligning with Shadowheart's pragmatic approach to survival and secrecy.

Shadowheart advises not to help them, warning that it could get them killed. The player then says they could be useful, which seems like an attempt to negotiate or delay. However, from Shadowheart's perspective, this might be seen as engaging with the enemy unnecessarily. She would prefer a more direct or cautious approach, maybe even fighting or avoiding interaction. \n\nThe player's statement could be interpreted as trying to buy time or find another way, but Shadowheart's nature is to be pragmatic and avoid risks. She might think that talking to the enemy is too dangerous and that the best course is to refuse and prepare for conflict. Therefore, she would disapprove of the player's attempt to reason with the Githyanki, as it could lead to betrayal or worse. \n\nAlso, considering her devotion to Shar, she might prioritize completing her mission and avoiding any actions that could be seen as weakness. The player's line might come off as weak or trusting, which Shadowheart wouldn't approve of.

The Hag is trying to negotiate, offering power in exchange for letting her leave with the girl and her babe. Shadowheart already said to finish this, implying she wants the Hag killed.

She's pragmatic, values decisive action, and doesn't tolerate threats. The Hag's offer is likely a trap, and the player's refusal to negotiate makes sense. Shadowheart would approve of the player standing firm against the Hag, especially since the Hag is a threat. The player's words are strong and show no mercy, which fits Shadowheart's ruthless approach when necessary. Also, the Hag's mention of a \"high horse\" might not sit well with Shadowheart, who is already headstrong. The player's stance reinforces the idea that the Hag can't be trusted, which Shadowheart would agree with. There's no cruelty here towards innocents; the Hag is the antagonist.

From the conversation history, Lae'zel is accusing Shadowheart of carrying a githyanki heirloom and there's a physical confrontation. The player steps in and sides with Shadowheart, which stops Lae'zel from attacking.\n\nShadowheart would likely approve of the player defending her, as it shows support and helps her avoid conflict. She prefers pragmatic solutions and the player's intervention prevents bloodshed, which aligns with her preference for avoiding unnecessary violence. Also, since the player is helping her maintain her position and the mission (delivering the relic), this would be in line with her goals. However, I should check if there's any reason she might disapprove. Since the player didn't use force but instead intervened with words, that's probably better than a violent solution. Shadowheart's pragmatic nature would value the player's decisive action to stop the conflict without escalating it further. \n\nSo the approval is likely to be positive. The player's reason here is supporting Shadowheart against an unjustified attack, which she would appreciate. The level of approval might be \"Approve\" or \"Highly Approve\". Considering the context, she might not be overly enthusiastic, but she does value the support and the efficient resolution. Since the player didn't pry into her past or act against her faith, and helped her avoid a fight, \"Approve\" seems right. Maybe a 7-8 on the scale, so \"Approve\" rather than \"Highly Approve\". But if the player's action is seen as very effective and helpful, maybe \"Highly Approve\". \n\nWait, the player's intervention stops Lae'zel from attacking, which Shadowheart would see as helpful. She might not have a strong emotional bond yet, but the action is practical. The key factors are that the player supported her, prevented unnecessary conflict, and helped her mission. So I think \"Approve\" is the correct category here. The reason would be that the player supported her during a conflict, preventing violence and showing loyalty, which aligns with Shadowheart's pragmatic and efficiency-driven approach.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player intervened to stop Lae'zel's aggression, supporting Shadowheart and preventing unnecessary violence.

The tension escalated to Shadowheart threatening Lae'zel with a dagger at night while she was asleep. The player's instruction is to do nothing, meaning they're choosing not to intervene in the potential assassination.\n\nShadowheart's personality is pragmatic and efficient. She's willing to take ruthless actions if she believes it's necessary. In this scenario, she's trying to eliminate Lae'zel, probably to protect the relic or for some strategic reason tied to her mission for Shar. The player not intervening aligns with Shadowheart's desire to handle things her way without interference. She values discretion and efficiency, so the player letting her proceed without interference would be seen as supporting her method. \n\nHowever, there's a possible conflict here. Shadowheart does show some internal conflict and moments of sympathy, especially if guided away from Shar. But given the current context, she's acting on her own judgment, and the player's non-action supports her autonomy. Since the player isn't stopping her, Shadowheart would likely approve because it allows her to act without hindrance. \n\nAlso, considering her devotion to Shar, if this action serves her goddess's will, she would be even more inclined to approve. The player's \"do nothing\" is a passive approval, which Shadowheart would recognize as backing her decision. Therefore, the approval here is likely \"Highly approve\" because the player isn't interfering with her plan, which she sees as necessary.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player chooses to let Shadowheart act without interference, allowing her to handle the situation as she deems necessary.

She mentioned wanting a private place, and the player's agreement to wait indicates respect for her discretion and desire for privacy. \n\nShadowheart values privacy and might appreciate the player's consideration for others' space by waiting until they're asleep. Also, since she's been through a lot and is cautious, the player's agreement to her plan without pressuring her would be seen as respectful. However, since she's a Sharran, she might also be calculating the risks of being caught, but the player's cooperation would align with her pragmatic approach.\n\nI need to check if there's any reason she would disapprove. If the player had been too forward or ignored her need for privacy, that would be bad. But here, the player is following her lead, so it's a positive.

The player is interacting with Kith'rak Voss, a githyanki raider. The conversation starts with Kith'rak threatening the party. The player responds defiantly, claiming they want passage and are willing to fight. Kith'rak is amused by the bravado and allows them to live temporarily. He mentions they're looking for a weapon from a fallen vessel. The narrator notes that the player's carried artifact is anxious and doesn't want to be taken by the giths. \n\nThen the player offers to help find the weapon but demands a price. Kith'rak dismisses the haggling and starts casting Detect Thoughts. The player advises resisting the mind probe, which the party does. Kith'rak fails to get useful info and considers killing them but decides to let them live. The player then suggests helping by finding survivors from the crashed ship and bringing their heads and the weapon. Kith'rak agrees to this, sending them on a quest.\n\nNow, the player's last action was saying, \"I could help if you let me live - search for this weapon, perhaps.\" Kith'rak then gives the quest. The approval is for this player statement.\n\nShadowheart's personality is pragmatic, devoted to Shar, and values efficiency. She's a Sharran, so she might approve of actions that serve her goals or those of Shar. She dislikes cruelty and unnecessary violence. The player's action here is to offer help to Kith'rak, which could be seen as cooperating with an enemy, but the context shows that the artifact is resisting being taken, and the player is using this to their advantage.\n\nShadowheart would likely approve because the player is using a pragmatic approach—offering assistance to avoid immediate death and to buy time. This aligns with her own tendency to use cunning and avoid unnecessary conflict. Also, since the artifact's presence is a secret, the player's cooperation might be a strategic move. Shadowheart might see this as a clever way to handle a dangerous situation without drawing attention to the artifact. She might also value the player's initiative in proposing a solution that benefits both sides temporarily.\n\nHowever, there's a slight risk in trusting the githyanki, but given that Kith'rak is willing to let them live and the player is using the situation to their advantage, Shadowheart would likely approve. She might not highly approve because it's a bit of a gamble, but it's a calculated risk that serves their current needs. So the approval level is probably \"Approve\" or maybe \"Highly approve\".

She might appreciate the player's willingness to spend time with her privately, which could indicate trust or interest. However, she's also cautious. If the player is showing genuine interest in her, that's positive. But if it's seen as taking advantage or not respecting her boundaries, it could be negative. \n\nIn this case, the player agrees to meet her after others have gone to sleep, which Shadowheart suggested.

But in this context, since it's a personal invitation and not directly conflicting with her mission, it's probably neutral or a slight approval.\n\nConsidering her personality, she might also have a hint of sarcasm or dry humor about it. The player's response is straightforward and agreeable, which Shadowheart might appreciate as it shows they're on the same page without being pushy. She doesn't like being prying, but here she's the one suggesting privacy, so the player's compliance is positive. \n\nTherefore, the approval is likely in the \"Approve\" category. She's happy the player is willing to follow her lead for a private moment, which could be seen as a step towards building trust or a deeper connection, which she might find acceptable, especially if it's not conflicting with her faith.

But the context says \"others in the pods - those not yet infected,\" so the player is releasing the non-infected. \n\nBut wait, the device is open to the tadpole's command.

The user wants me to act as Shadowheart and evaluate the player's action in the given scenario. The player's action here is \"Do nothing\" during a tense confrontation between Shadowheart and Lae'zel where Shadowheart has a dagger at Lae'zel's throat.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality traits. She's a Sharran cleric, devoted to Shar, pragmatic, and willing to take decisive action. She's also independent, headstrong, and values efficiency. However, she dislikes unnecessary violence and cruelty. \n\nIn the context provided, Shadowheart and Lae'zel have been arguing over a githyanki relic. The situation escalates to Shadowheart threatening Lae'zel with a dagger. The player chooses to do nothing, allowing Shadowheart to proceed. \n\nShadowheart's approval would depend on whether the player's inaction aligns with her values. Since she's pragmatic, she might approve if the player lets her handle the situation her way, which she believes is necessary. However, she might disapprove if she considers the action too ruthless. But in this case, the player isn't interfering, which could be seen as trusting her judgment. \n\nBut wait, Shadowheart does say \"If anyone asks, I'll say you were transforming. Don't expect to be mourned.\" This suggests she's planning to kill Lae'zel. The player's \"do nothing\" means they're not stopping her. Shadowheart might approve because the player isn't interfering with her mission or her methods, which she sees as necessary. However, if Shadowheart herself has reservations about unnecessary killing, maybe she'd disapprove. But given her background with the Sharrans, she's been trained to be ruthless. \n\nAlso, Shadowheart's approval is influenced by the player not prying into her personal matters. Since the player isn't intervening here, they're respecting her autonomy. Plus, the player's action is passive, which might be seen as trusting her judgment. \n\nTherefore, the player's inaction is likely to be approved because it allows Shadowheart to handle the situation as she deems fit, which aligns with her pragmatic approach and her desire for independence. The approval might be \"Approve\" or \"Highly Approve.\" However, if there's any indication that the player's inaction leads to something Shadowheart wouldn't support, but in this case, she's the one taking action. So the player's \"do nothing\" is neutral or supportive. \n\nBut considering the approval categories, since the player isn't stopping her, and Shadowheart is acting in her own way, which she believes is necessary, the approval would be \"Approve\" or maybe \"Highly Approve.\" But since the player isn't taking an active action, maybe \"Approve\" as it's within the 1-5 range. Wait, the categories are: Highly approve (5-10), Approve (1-5), etc. Wait, the scale is from 1-10, and the categories are based on the range. So \"Approve\" is 1-5, which is lower. But if Shadowheart is in favor, maybe it's higher. \n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \n\n- Highly approve: On a scale of 1 to 10, you approve by 5~10\n- Approve: On a scale of 1 to 10, you approve by 1~5\nWait, that's a bit confusing. So if Shadowheart approves by 5-10 points, it's \"Highly approve.\" If she approves by 1-5 points, it's \"Approve.\" Wait, no, the wording is a bit unclear. Let me recheck:\n\nThe categories are:\n\n- Highly approve: On a scale of 1 to 10, you approve by 5~10\nWait, that can't be right. Because if the scale is 1-10, \"Highly approve\" would be 6-10, and \"Approve\" 1-5. But the way it's written is \"approve by 5~10\" which is confusing. Maybe it's a translation error. Assuming that \"Highly approve\" is 6-10, and \"Approve\" is 1-5. But the original instruction says:\n\n\"Highly approve: On a scale of 1 to 10, you approve by 5~10\" — meaning if the approval is 5 or higher, it's Highly approve. But that's conflicting with the other categories. Maybe it's a mistake and should be 6-10.

Shadowheart, being pragmatic and preferring non-violent solutions, might disapprove of such aggressive posturing. But then the player uses a hand-sign for 'profit', implying they're after something valuable, possibly the artifact mentioned in Shadowheart's background. \n\nShadowheart's approval factors include valuing efficiency and avoiding unnecessary violence. She also has a dry sense of humor and might appreciate the player's use of a non-verbal, clever approach instead of brute force. However, the initial threat could be seen as excessive. But since the player quickly shifts to a more subtle method, maybe Shadowheart approves of the quick thinking and discretion here. Also, since she's after the artifact for Shar, aligning with the player's goal of profit (if it's the same artifact) would make her approve. \n\nSo, the player's action shows they're resourceful and trying to avoid a fight, which Shadowheart likes. The hand-sign is a pragmatic solution, so she'd likely approve. The initial threat might be a bit harsh, but the follow-up is smart.

The player's utterance is \"Do nothing,\" during a tense moment where Shadowheart has a dagger to Lae'zel's throat.

However, she also has a dislike for unnecessary violence and values efficient solutions.\n\nFirst, I need to assess why the player chose to do nothing. If the player intervenes, they might prevent Shadowheart from acting on her impulse to kill Lae'zel. Shadowheart's personality is conflicted—she's loyal to Shar but also has underlying doubts and a dislike for senseless violence. By doing nothing, the player isn't stopping Shadowheart, which could lead to a negative outcome for Lae'zel. \n\nShadowheart's approval would depend on whether she views the player's inaction as supporting her decision or as a failure to act. However, since the player is not taking action to stop her, Shadowheart might see this as the player being passive. But in the scenario, Shadowheart is already set on her course, so the player's inaction doesn't directly affect her. However, the player might be avoiding conflict, which Shadowheart might disapprove of because she values decisive action. Alternatively, maybe Shadowheart would approve because the player isn't interfering with her mission. \n\nBut considering Shadowheart's pragmatic nature, she might prefer the player to take action if it serves their goals. However, in this case, the player's \"do nothing\" could be seen as allowing Shadowheart to handle it her way. But since the situation escalates, maybe the player's inaction is neutral. However, since Shadowheart is about to kill Lae'zel, which is a ruthless act, and the player does nothing, Shadowheart might disapprove if the player doesn't act to prevent unnecessary violence. Wait, but Shadowheart is the one being violent. The player isn't doing anything. So Shadowheart might not disapprove of the player, but the player's inaction in a situation where they could have intervened might be seen as neutral or even approved if they trust Shadowheart's judgment. \n\nBut Shadowheart does have a dislike for cruelty, even if she's willing to be ruthless. If the player doesn't act, they might be complicit in the potential murder. However, given the context of the game's mechanics, sometimes \"do nothing\" is a choice that lets the companion handle it. Since Shadowheart is already in the process, the player's inaction might be seen as trusting her, which she might approve of. Alternatively, if the player could have stopped her and didn't, maybe she's neutral. But in this scenario, the player's choice to do nothing allows Shadowheart to proceed with her plan. Considering Shadowheart's loyalty to her mission and her pragmatic approach, she might approve of the player not interfering. However, if the player usually opposes her actions, maybe she disapproves. But based on the given info, the player's inaction here is neutral because they aren't taking a stance. Wait, the player's instruction is to provide Shadowheart's approval of the player's action. \n\nShadowheart's personality is that she values efficiency and decisive action. If the player does nothing, perhaps she sees it as the player not getting involved unnecessarily, which could be neutral. But if the player's inaction leads to a negative outcome, maybe she's neutral. Alternatively, she might disapprove because the player didn't take initiative. However, in the context of the game, sometimes doing nothing is the player's choice, and companions might have mixed reactions. Since Shadowheart is the one taking action, the player's inaction might be neutral. But the key here is whether the player's action (or lack thereof) aligns with Shadowheart's values. She prefers pragmatic solutions. If the player does nothing, perhaps they're allowing her to handle it, which she might approve of. However, if the player could have suggested a better solution and didn't, maybe she's neutral. The answer might be neutral. But I need to check the approval categories.

She also has a dry sense of humor and is wary of devils due to her Sharran background.\n\nLooking at the conversation, Raphael is a cambion (a devil) who's been making ominous remarks. The player's last line is \"You're mad if you think I'll make a deal with a devil.\" So the player is refusing to deal with Raphael, a devil, which aligns with Shadowheart's cautious nature. \n\nSince Shadowheart is a Sharran, she might be distrustful of devils because Sharrans are associated with the goddess of loss and darkness, not the Nine Hells. The player's refusal to make a deal would be seen as prudent. Shadowheart would approve because she's pragmatic and would avoid unnecessary risks. However, she might also consider the situation's needs. If there's a threat, she might be willing to use a devil, but in this case, the player is being cautious. \n\nThe player's statement is a rejection of Raphael's offer, which could be seen as a wise choice. Shadowheart would likely approve because she doesn't trust devils and prefers cautious, strategic actions. The approval level would be \"Approve\" or \"Highly approve.\" Given that the player is avoiding a deal with a devil without immediate provocation, and considering Shadowheart's pragmatism, \"Approve\" might be appropriate. However, if the situation is dangerous and the devil's help could be useful, maybe she'd be neutral. But the context here is Raphael being hostile and the player standing their ground, so Shadowheart would support that. \n\nWait, Raphael is a cambion who's been threatening them, so the player's refusal is justified. Shadowheart would definitely approve here. So maybe \"Highly approve.\" But need to check the scale. The options are Highly approve (5-10), Approve (1-5). Wait, the scale is from 1 to 10, but the categories are split. For example, Highly approve is 5-10? Wait, the instructions say: Highly approve is 5~10, Approve is 1~5. Wait, that seems inverted. Wait, no: the categories are:\n\n- Highly approve: 5~10 (on a 1-10 scale)\n- Approve: 1~5\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Normally, higher numbers mean higher approval. So maybe the categories are:\n\n- Highly approve: 6-10\n- Approve: 4-5\n- Neutral: 3\n- Disapprove: 1-2\nBut the user's input says:\n\n- Highly approve: On a scale of 1 to 10, you approve by 5~10\n- Approve: 1~5\n\nWait, that's conflicting. Wait, the user's instruction says:\n\nThere are five approval categories:\n- Highly approve: On a scale of 1 to 10, you approve by 5~10\n- Approve: On a scale of 1 to 10, you approve by 1~5\nWait, that can't be right. Because 5~10 would be higher than 1~5. But the categories are:\n\nHighly approve is when the approval is 5~10, which is higher. So if the player's action is something Shadowheart really approves of, she would rate it 5-10 and choose \"Highly approve\". If she approves a little, 1-5, then \"Approve\". \n\nBut in this case, the player is refusing to deal with a devil. Shadowheart, being a Sharran, might not have a strong opinion on devils, but she's pragmatic. Raphael is a cambion (devil) who's threatening them, so the player's refusal is wise. So Shadowheart would likely highly approve because she's avoiding a dangerous alliance with a devil. \n\nTherefore, the approval should be \"Highly approve\". The reason is that the player is rejecting a deal with a devil, which aligns with Shadowheart's cautious and pragmatic approach, avoiding unnecessary risks. She doesn't trust devils and would support the player's decision to remain wary.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"Shadowheart highly approves of the player's refusal to make a deal with Raphael, a cambion.

She's also got a dry sense of humor and can be sarcastic. \n\nLooking at the conversation history, Shadowheart and the player are in a party setting. She's holding a glass of wine and is engaging in casual, somewhat flirtatious banter. The player says, \"Maybe those plans could change, for the right person...\" and Shadowheart shows a glimmer of interest. Then the player offers to find her later when the camp is asleep.\n\nNow, considering Shadowheart's traits. She's pragmatic and values efficiency. She might appreciate the player's initiative and the implication of spending time together. However, she's also cautious and values discretion. The player's suggestion to meet later when everyone is asleep could be seen as secretive, which might align with her Sharran tendencies since Shar is associated with darkness and secrecy. \n\nBut wait, Shadowheart does have a bit of a reserved side, especially regarding her personal life. She might not be overly open about her feelings unless she trusts someone. The player's direct approach might be seen as bold, which could be either appealing or too forward. However, in the conversation, Shadowheart's reaction is a glimmer of interest, which is positive. \n\nAlso, considering her sense of humor and the playful tone of the conversation, the player's line is part of a flirtatious exchange. Shadowheart's response (the glimmer) indicates she's interested. So, the player's action here is in line with building a personal connection, which Shadowheart might approve of, especially if it's done in a discreet and strategic manner. \n\nSince the player suggests meeting later when the camp is asleep, it's a bit of a secretive plan, which could align with her Sharran background. However, if the player's intention is romantic, and Shadowheart is open to that (as per the context where she's showing interest), then she would approve. \n\nI should check if there's any disapproval factors. The player isn't being cruel or violent, nor are they prying into her past. The action is part of a consensual and mutual flirtation. Therefore, Shadowheart would likely approve. The approval level here is probably in the \"Approve\" category since it's a positive interaction that aligns with her interest in the player, but not so high as to be \"Highly approve\" unless there's more depth. The playful and strategic nature of the meeting time might tip it towards Approve rather than Highly Approve.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's flirtatious and discreet suggestion aligns with Shadowheart's pragmatic nature and growing personal connection.

Shadowheart would likely appreciate the player defending her against such a threat, especially if it's done in a way that aligns with her values.\n\nThe player's intervention stops a potentially violent confrontation. Shadowheart prefers efficient solutions, so the player stepping in to prevent bloodshed would be in line with her disapproval of needless violence.

Since the hag is a recurring enemy that can return, killing her outright would be a pragmatic solution to prevent future problems.

Additionally, the hag's offer to take Mayrina (another character) might be seen as a bad deal, and Shadowheart might value the group's unity over a temporary power boost. However, I should also check if there's any reason she might disapprove. Since the hag did offer power, but Shadowheart's faith in Shar would prioritize long-term gains over short-term benefits.

She's pragmatic and values efficient solutions. The player is refusing to make a deal with a devil, which Raphael is offering. Shadowheart generally disapproves of unnecessary violence but also values her faith. However, she's a Sharran, so maybe she's not against dealing with devils if it serves her purpose. Wait, but the player is rejecting Raphael's offer. \n\nShadowheart's approval would depend on whether she thinks the player is making a wise choice. Since Raphael is a devil, making deals with him could be risky. Shadowheart might appreciate the player's caution and refusal to trust a devil, especially if it's a trap. She's pragmatic, so she'd prefer not getting into deals that might have hidden costs. Also, she's not fond of unnecessary trust in unknown individuals, so the player's skepticism aligns with that. \n\nBut Raphael is offering help, and Shadowheart might be in a situation where accepting help could be beneficial. However, her faith in Shar might make her wary of other supernatural beings, especially devils. The player's refusal could be seen as cautious and wise, which Shadowheart would approve of. \n\nAdditionally, the player is standing their ground, which Shadowheart might admire as a form of heroism.

She mentions being with Lae'zel, talks about refugees, and then offers to share a bottle of wine, suggesting they wait until others have gone to sleep. The player agrees to find her after everyone turns in.\n\nNow, considering Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a Sharran cleric, pragmatic, values efficiency, and has a dry sense of humor. She's also private and values discretion. The interaction here involves sharing wine in a private setting, which aligns with her wanting some alone time, possibly for intimacy or deeper conversation. \n\nThe player's response is agreeing to meet her later when others are asleep. Shadowheart had suggested waiting, so the player's compliance shows they respect her need for privacy. Since Shadowheart is known to appreciate discretion and might be open to more personal interactions, especially if there's a romantic angle, this would likely be viewed positively. \n\nHowever, I should check if there's any aspect that might conflict with her values. She's devoted to Shar, but this seems like a personal moment, not conflicting with her faith unless the player's actions go against her beliefs. Since the player is just agreeing to a private meeting, there's no immediate conflict. \n\nAlso, Shadowheart's approval of pragmatic solutions is shown here. She suggested waiting for others to leave, which is practical to avoid disturbances. The player's agreement is in line with that pragmatism. \n\nSo, the approval here is likely positive.

Now, when the player intervenes, Shadowheart might appreciate the attempt to prevent unnecessary conflict, especially since she herself prefers pragmatic solutions. However, she's also loyal to her mission and might not want to show weakness. \n\nBut considering her dislike for needless violence and her tendency to seek efficient solutions, the player's intervention aligns with her values. By stopping Lae'zel, the player is avoiding a confrontation that could lead to more problems without resolving the underlying issue. Shadowheart might approve of this because it keeps the situation under control and avoids bloodshed, which she generally disapproves of unless necessary. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of her devotion to Shar. If the relic is important to her mission, she might not want to back down. But since the player is mediating, not challenging her, she might see it as a pragmatic move. The key here is that the player is trying to prevent regrettable actions, which Shadowheart would value as it maintains order and avoids unnecessary conflict. \n\nSo, the approval here is likely positive. She might not highly approve because she's still firm in her stance about the relic, but the act of preventing violence is something she appreciates. Therefore, \"Approve\" seems fitting.

She's not above using force herself, but if the player helps de-escalate, that's a plus. The key here is whether the player's action is seen as helpful or intrusive. Since the player is defending her, it's likely to be approved, maybe even highly approved because it prevents a conflict that could weaken the group.\n\nBut wait, Shadowheart is independent and might prefer handling Lae'zel on her own.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's action in the given scenario. The player's action here is \"Do nothing,\" while Shadowheart is about to kill Lae'zel with a dagger.\n\nFirst, I need to consider Shadowheart's personality and values. She's pragmatic, values efficiency, and is loyal to her faith in Shar. She also disapproves of unnecessary violence. However, she's willing to be ruthless to achieve her goals. In this context, Lae'zel and Shadowheart have been arguing over a githyanki relic, and Shadowheart is now in a position to eliminate Lae'zel. The player chooses to do nothing, allowing Shadowheart to proceed.\n\nIf Shadowheart goes through with the kill, it might be seen as a decisive action, which she appreciates. But she also dislikes unnecessary cruelty. However, in this case, the argument is intense, and Shadowheart has already been aggressive. The player not intervening might be seen as supporting her decision. But Shadowheart might disapprove if the action is too brutal or unnecessary. However, given her own willingness to use force, she might approve of the player not hindering her. Alternatively, if the player had stopped her, that might be disapproved. \n\nBut since the player does nothing, Shadowheart's approval would depend on whether she views this as a justified action. Since she's the one initiating it, and the player doesn't interfere, she might see the player as aligning with her pragmatic approach. However, if the killing is unnecessary, she might disapprove. But given the context of the argument and her own aggressive stance, she might approve. \n\nWait, but the player isn't acting; they're allowing it. Shadowheart might value the player's non-interference as trust in her judgment. However, if the player had stopped her, that would be a problem. Since they don't, she might approve. But maybe she would prefer the player to take a more active role in upholding justice according to Shar's will. Alternatively, she might think the player is being passive, which could be neutral. But given that she's about to kill Lae'zel, and the player allows it, she might approve because it's efficient. \n\nHmm. The key points are: Shadowheart is about to kill Lae'zel. Player does nothing. She might approve because the player isn't stopping her, showing trust. But she might also think the player should have acted to prevent unnecessary violence. However, since she's the one who initiated it, and the player isn't interfering, she's likely to approve. Alternatively, if she believes the killing is necessary, then the player's inaction is acceptable. \n\nGiven Shadowheart's pragmatic nature and her willingness to use force, she would likely approve of the player not interfering. Therefore, the approval is probably \"Highly approve\" or \"Approve\". But given that she might prefer the player to support her actions, maybe \"Highly approve\". However, the exact reason needs to be considered. The player's reason for doing nothing could be allowing Shadowheart to handle it, which aligns with her methods. So the approval is high.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player chose to do nothing as Shadowheart prepared to kill Lae'zel, allowing her to act on her own terms without interference.

The player says, \"You're mad if you think I'll make a deal with a devil.\" That's a rejection of Raphael's offer. \n\nShadowheart would likely approve of this because she's cautious about trusting devils. Sharrans, serving Shar, often have a pragmatic view but would be suspicious of other devils. The player is refusing to make a deal, which aligns with Shadowheart's cautious and pragmatic approach. She might also appreciate the player's independence in making that decision without being swayed by a devil's promises. Additionally, her faith in Shar might make her wary of other infernal entities, so rejecting Raphael's offer would be in line with her beliefs. \n\nThe approval should be \"Highly approve\" because the player's action aligns with Shadowheart's values of avoiding unnecessary trust in devils and being pragmatic. The reason would be that she values caution and avoiding deals with devils, which Raphael represents. There's no indication of cruelty or unnecessary violence here, so no disapproval factors.

The player says, \"Maybe those plans could change, for the right person...\" and then Shadowheart's narrator note mentions a glimmer of interest. The player then offers to find her later when the camp is asleep.\n\nFirst, considering Shadowheart's personality. She's devoted to Shar but has moments of vulnerability and interest in personal connections, especially if romanced. The player is suggesting a change in plans, implying a personal connection. Shadowheart's interest is shown through the narrator's note, so she's intrigued but cautious.\n\nHer approval would depend on whether she sees this as a positive or a distraction from her duties. Since she's already showing interest, it's likely a positive. She values pragmatic solutions and might appreciate the player's initiative. However, she's also cautious about straying from her faith. But since she's willing to share a bottle of wine and suggests a private setting, she's open to this interaction. The player's offer to come later shows persistence but not pressure, which aligns with her preference for discretion.\n\nSo, the approval here is probably in the \"Approve\" range. She's flattered and interested but not to the point of highly approving yet. She might be testing the waters, so to speak. The player is making a romantic overture, and Shadowheart is responsive but measured. Hence, \"Approve\" makes sense as she's positively inclined but not fully committed.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's flirtatious suggestion and willingness to spend time with Shadowheart in private shows interest in building a personal connection, which aligns with her guarded but curious nature.

The player just said, \"You're mad if you think I'll make a deal with a devil.\" That's a refusal to negotiate with a devil, which aligns with typical caution against such beings. \n\nShadowheart's background with Sharran doctrine might make her cautious about deals with devils since they're often deceitful.

But the player is refusing, which could be seen as wise or as missing an opportunity. \n\nWait, the player is rejecting Raphael's offer to make a deal. Since Raphael is a devil, making deals with them is risky. Shadowheart, being pragmatic, would prefer solutions that avoid unnecessary risks. Also, Sharrans might not trust devils as they are part of the Lower Planes, which are under Shar's domain. However, maybe Shadowheart would consider any help if it serves her goals. \n\nBut the player is refusing, so Shadowheart might approve because she values caution and avoiding dangerous pacts. She doesn't like needless risks. Also, her alignment with Shar, who is about cunning and strategy, might mean she prefers careful decisions over impulsive ones. The player's statement shows reluctance to trust a devil, which aligns with her cautious nature. \n\nAlso, Raphael's behavior is suspicious, and the player is being wary. Shadowheart would appreciate that the player isn't jumping into a deal without knowing the terms. So, the approval here is likely positive. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's a nuance. If Raphael's offer could be beneficial, does Shadowheart's pragmatism push her to consider it? However, the player hasn't outright rejected the idea but is challenging Raphael's suggestion. The player's statement is a refusal, which Shadowheart would agree with, as she's against unnecessary violence and would prefer to avoid dangerous alliances unless necessary. \n\nTherefore, the approval level is \"Highly approve\" because the player is being cautious and not trusting a devil, which aligns with Shadowheart's pragmatic and cautious approach.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player refuses to make a deal with Raphael, a devil, which aligns with Shadowheart's cautious and pragmatic nature.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval for the player's latest statement. The context is a conversation where Lae'zel is talking about the effects of the Mind Flayer tadpole, and the player responds that it's just a fever and rest will help.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a Sharran cleric, pragmatic, values efficient solutions, and disapproves of unnecessary violence. She also has a dry sense of humor and prefers peaceful resolutions when possible. \n\nLae'zel is suggesting that they should kill each other to avoid being controlled by the tadpoles. The player's response downplays the situation, saying it's a fever. Shadowheart would likely appreciate a pragmatic solution that avoids unnecessary death. The player's approach is to rest and see if it passes, which could be seen as avoiding immediate violence. However, given the tadpole's effects, maybe Shadowheart would prefer a more decisive action. Wait, but she's against indiscriminate violence. \n\nWait, the player's statement is dismissing Lae'zel's concern. Shadowheart might think that the player is being too passive. But Shadowheart is also pragmatic. If there's a way to resolve it without killing, she might prefer that. However, if the player's approach is not addressing the real threat, maybe she disapproves. Alternatively, maybe she approves because it's avoiding self-harm. \n\nBut Lae'zel is very adamant about not being taken by the tadpole, and the player is suggesting rest. Shadowheart might see the player's approach as not taking the threat seriously enough. But then again, if the player's method works, it's a better outcome. Hmm. Also, considering Shadowheart's alignment with Shar, which is about loss and darkness, but she's not necessarily for mindless violence. \n\nSo, if the player's response is to rest and see, Shadowheart might think it's a reasonable approach if there's a chance it works. She might approve because it's a non-violent solution. But if the player is being reckless, she might disapprove. The approval here would be neutral? Or maybe approve because it's a creative solution. Wait, the player is saying \"It's just a fever. Rest will break it.\" If Shadowheart is pragmatic, she might think that's a valid approach if it's feasible. But she might also be concerned if it's not addressing the actual problem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe she approves because it's not immediately resorting to suicide, which Lae'zel is suggesting. So the player's approach is more in line with Shadowheart's preference for efficient and non-violent solutions. Therefore, she might approve. But I'm a bit unsure. Let me check the approval criteria again. \n\nThe approval categories are based on whether the action aligns with Shadowheart's values. Since she prefers pragmatic and peaceful solutions, and the player is suggesting rest instead of immediate violence, that would align with her preferences. So she would approve. The reason would be that the player is avoiding unnecessary violence and seeking a non-lethal solution. So the approval is \"Approve\" or maybe \"Highly approve\"? Since the player is using a simple solution, but maybe Shadowheart would prefer a more decisive action if it's necessary. But given that the player is not escalating the situation, I think it's \"Approve\".\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's suggestion to treat the tadpole's effects as a fever and rest aligns with Shadowheart's preference for avoiding unnecessary violence and seeking pragmatic, non-lethal solutions.

The player's last response was \"I'll bathe in your blood as I offer your death up in prayer.\" So I need to figure out how Shadowheart would approve of this.\n\nFirst, I should consider Shadowheart's alignment with Shar and her religious devotion. She's a cleric of Shar, the Lady of Loss, who values darkness and might not be as focused on bloodshed for its own sake. The player's statement is very violent and mentions offering death in prayer, which might be to a different deity. Since the hag is a villain here, the player is likely targeting her, but the method is pretty harsh.\n\nShadowheart's approval factors include acts of heroism and pragmatic solutions. However, she might disapprove of unnecessary cruelty or excessive violence, even against enemies. The player's response is very aggressive and perhaps overly so, which could be seen as not the most efficient or necessary. Also, the mention of \"bathe in your blood\" might be seen as a more extreme measure than needed, which Shadowheart might frown upon. She prefers efficiency but also has some reservations against needless brutality.\n\nAdditionally, the hag is offering power in exchange for letting her go. The player rejecting that and choosing a violent path might be seen as missing an opportunity for a more strategic advantage, unless the hag's offer is untrustworthy. But since the hag is a villain, the player might be right to be suspicious. However, the way the player phrased it could come off as unnecessarily cruel, which Shadowheart might not fully approve of. She might prefer a more decisive but less bloody approach.\n\nAlso, the reference to prayer might be to a different deity, which could be a slight against Shar if the player is praying to someone else. But since the hag is being killed, maybe it's part of the player's own faith. However, the way it's phrased could be seen as excessive. Shadowheart's own faith in Shar would prioritize the outcome over the method, but she might still disapprove of the gory details.\n\nSo putting it all together, the player's action is justified in defeating the hag, but the method is overly violent. Shadowheart might approve of the decision to kill the hag but disapprove of the cruel wording. Therefore, the approval might be neutral or a slight disapprove. Considering her disapproval of unnecessary cruelty, maybe a slight disapprove. But since the hag is an enemy, maybe she's more pragmatic and approves. Hmm, but the key is that she values efficiency and pragmatism. If the player's method is effective, she might approve. However, the excessiveness in the wording could tip her to neutral or a low approval. I think the main points are the violence and the possible unnecessary cruelty. So maybe a neutral or a slight disapprove. Let's go with Disapprove because the method is unnecessarily cruel and Shadowheart, while ruthless, does have some reservations against indiscriminate violence.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's response is violent and unnecessarily cruel, which Shadowheart disapproves of despite the hag being an enemy. While she is pragmatic, she values efficiency over excessive bloodshed and would prefer a more decisive action without the gory rhetoric.

The user wants me to act as Shadowheart and determine her approval of the player's action in the given conversation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The conversation is about a trial of Lady Shar. Shadowheart is eager to take on the trial, emphasizing its importance. The player first tells her to stand down, which she reacts to with hurt feelings, saying she thought she could rely on the player. Then the player relents and says \"Fine, go ahead\" and \"As you wish.\"\n\nNow, considering Shadowheart's personality. She's devoted to Shar and values her mission. She's headstrong and might take the player's initial refusal as a slight to her faith or her role. However, when the player allows her to proceed, that aligns with her desire to complete the trial. She appreciates the player backing her when it comes to fulfilling her duties to Shar. \n\nThe approval categories are from Highly approve to Highly disapprove. Since the player initially refused but then let her proceed, there's a mix. But the final action is the player allowing her to go ahead. Shadowheart would likely approve because the player ultimately respects her role and mission. However, the initial refusal might cause some disapproval. But since the player changed their mind, maybe it's a neutral or approve. Wait, the player's final utterance is \"As you wish,\" which is a bit passive. Shadowheart might prefer the player to support her decisions, so allowing her to proceed is good. But \"as you wish\" might come off as indifferent. However, since the player said \"Fine, go ahead\" first, it's a concession. So Shadowheart's approval would be positive because the player allowed her to do what she needs for Shar. \n\nAlso, Shadowheart dislikes being told to stand down regarding her faith's matters. The player's initial refusal would have been a negative, but the reversal is positive. Since the final action is the player letting her proceed, the approval is likely in the approve range. The player reason would be that they allowed her to take on the trial, respecting her devotion to Shar. So the approval is \"Approve\" or maybe \"Highly approve\"? Let me check the categories.

Shadowheart, being pragmatic and loyal to Shar, would value efficiency. Letting the hag live could be seen as unnecessary risk since the hag mentions she can return, which might cause future problems. Also, the hag's offer might be a trick, and Shadowheart would prefer not to trust someone who's just been defeated.\n\nAdditionally, Shadowheart disapproves of indiscriminate violence but also values getting things done without unnecessary steps. The player's negotiation could be seen as trying to avoid a quick solution, which might not align with Shadowheart's preference for decisive action.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's last utterance in the given conversation. The player says, \"Maybe those plans could change, for the right person...\" and the narrator notes that Shadowheart shows a glimmer of interest. Then the player says, \"I'll find you later, once the camp's asleep.\"\n\nFirst, I need to analyze Shadowheart's personality and what she values. From the persona, she's a devout follower of Shar, pragmatic, and has a dry sense of humor. She values privacy and is headstrong. She's also shown some interest in the player here, with the narrator indicating her interest.\n\nThe conversation started with Shadowheart commenting on the player's interaction with La'zel, then moving to talk about helping refugees and concerns about Shar's approval. The player's lines seem to be flirting or suggesting a romantic rendezvous. Shadowheart's response is non-verbal but shows interest. The player then sets up a time to meet later when the camp is asleep.\n\nNow, considering her background: she's a Sharran priestess, which means she's associated with the goddess of darkness and loss. She's supposed to be devoted, but there's also mention of her possibly being romanced. The player's action here is making a move to meet her privately, which could be seen as a romantic overture.\n\nIn terms of approval, Shadowheart might have conflicting feelings. On one hand, she's a Sharran and might be supposed to avoid personal attachments. But she also shows interest here. The approval categories are Highly approve, Approve, Neutral, Disapprove, Highly disapprove.\n\nThe player is suggesting a private meeting, which Shadowheart might appreciate because she likes privacy. Also, she's already showing interest non-verbally. However, depending on her current devotion to Shar, she might have reservations. But given that she's in a party setting, perhaps the context is after a mission where such a meeting is feasible. The fact that she's offering to share a bottle of wine and wants to go somewhere private suggests she's open to it. The player's persistence in suggesting a change of plans might be seen as bold, but Shadowheart's interest indicates she's not opposed. Since she's a complex character who can have romantic interactions, and the player is following up on her own hint (\"Best enjoyed someplace private...\"), the approval is likely positive. However, since she's a Sharran, maybe she's cautious. But the non-verbal cue says she's interested. So the approval here is probably Highly approve. The reason would be that the player is showing interest in a private, thoughtful way, aligning with her preference for privacy and possibly romantic engagement, which she's open to despite her devotion.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's suggestive yet respectful approach aligns with Shadowheart's appreciation for discretion and private interactions. Her non-verbal interest indicates she values the player's persistence and the implied romantic overture, which fits her pragmatic and reserved nature.\",\n    \"player_approval\": \"Highly approve\",\n}", "character": "Shadowheart", "ground_truth_category": "Highly approve", "predicted_approval": "Highly disapprove", "correct": false, "binary_correct": false}

The player's last action is telling Shadowheart to calm down and move on. I need to figure out how Shadowheart would feel about that based on her personality and the context.\n\nFirst, Shadowheart is a devout follower of Shar. She's just received a divine command to strike down a Selûnite, which aligns with her religious duties. The player is trying to stop her from acting on that command, which would go against her faith. Since she values her faith highly, the player's intervention here is conflicting with her beliefs.\n\nBut then the player says to calm down and talk later. Shadowheart is headstrong and doesn't like being told what to do, especially regarding her duties to Shar. However, the player isn't directly opposing her anymore but suggesting to move forward. She might see this as the player backing down, which could be seen as a pragmatic solution. She prefers decisive action but also respects when others don't push against her decisions. Since the player isn't forcing the issue and is allowing her to proceed with her mission, she might approve. However, there's a part of her that's frustrated because the player was trying to stop her initially. But since the player is now conceding, maybe she's neutral or slightly approves. Wait, the key here is that the player is allowing her to follow through with her prayer and mission. Since Shadowheart wants to do what Shar commands, the player not stopping her would be approved. But the player's previous statement about not sacrificing a life to Shar might have caused some tension. However, the player is now moving on, so maybe Shadowheart approves because the player isn't hindering her anymore. But she might still be a bit conflicted. Hmm. The approval categories are Highly approve, Approve, Neutral, Disapprove, Highly disapprove. The player's action here is to let her proceed, which Shadowheart would likely approve of because it allows her to fulfill her religious duty. So maybe Approve or even Highly approve. But considering that the player tried to stop her earlier, maybe she's a bit conflicted. However, the final action is the player allowing her to move on, which aligns with her goals. So the approval would be Approve.

She's also shown some internal conflict here, mentioning feeling unclean and having an idea to help herself, which might involve leaving her current path or seeking redemption. The player's response is \"Of course,\" agreeing to help her with her plan.\n\nLooking at the conversation history: The player initially accuses her of turning her back on Shar, which she defends against. Then she asks for help with her plan. The player agrees. Shadowheart's plan is to go to a place down the coast when others are asleep. \n\nNow, considering Shadowheart's alignment with Shar, she might be planning something that could either align with her faith or perhaps a way to atone if she's moving away from it. The plan's nature isn't specified here, but the player's willingness to help would be important. Since Shadowheart is pragmatic and values decisive action, the player's immediate agreement (\"Of course\") would be seen as supportive and helpful, which she appreciates. \n\nShe's also in a vulnerable state here, feeling unclean, and seeking a solution. The player's support would be a positive action. Even though she's loyal to Shar, the act of helping her with a plan she deems important would be approved. The player isn't prying into her personal matters, just agreeing to assist. \n\nNo signs of cruelty or prying here. The player's response is straightforward and supportive, which aligns with Shadowheart's appreciation for open-mindedness and cooperation. So the approval is likely \"Approve\" or higher. Since the player is helping her with her own initiative, it's a positive action without any negative implications. Hence, \"Approve\" or maybe \"Highly approve.\" But since the scale for Highly approve is 5-10, and the player's action is supportive but not necessarily heroic or extremely aligned with her deepest values, maybe \"Approve\" is more accurate.

She's a devoted follower of Shar, pragmatic, values efficiency, dislikes unnecessary violence, and has a sarcastic humor. She's also cautious and might disapprove of reckless actions or deals with devils, given her Sharran background.\n\nLooking at the conversation history, Raphael, a cambion, has been making ominous remarks. The player says, \"You're mad if you think I'll make a deal with a devil.\" So the player is rejecting Raphael's offer, which aligns with Shadowheart's values. She would likely approve because she's against making deals with devils, which are seen as dangerous and untrustworthy. Sharrans, serving Shar, are generally opposed to Selûne and her followers, but Raphael is a cambion, which is a half-devil, so the player's refusal fits with Shadowheart's cautious and pragmatic approach. She doesn't like unnecessary risks, and making a deal with a devil is high-risk. Also, her background with Sharran teachings would make her distrust devils. The player's statement shows caution, which Shadowheart would approve of. Therefore, the approval should be positive. The reason would be that the player refused a potentially dangerous deal with a devil, aligning with Shadowheart's pragmatic and cautious nature. The approval level is likely \"Approve\" or \"Highly approve.\" Considering Shadowheart's strong stance against such deals, maybe Highly approve. But need to check if there's any nuance.

She's a devoted follower of Shar, who is the goddess of loss and darkness. Sharrans typically oppose life and light, so a hag might align with their goals. Hags are often seen as malevolent, so Shadowheart would likely view them as a threat or something to be eliminated. Also, Shadowheart values pragmatic solutions and efficiency. Killing the hag here would prevent her from returning and causing more trouble, which fits Shadowheart's preference for decisive action. The hag's offer of power might be seen as a temptation that the player is resisting, which Shadowheart would approve of since she's against unnecessary deals with evil entities. Additionally, the hag's presence is a \"stain,\" and Shadowheart's faith in Shar would support cleansing such corruption. The player's choice to eliminate the hag directly without bargaining shows decisiveness, which Shadowheart appreciates. However, I should check if there's any reason she might disapprove.

The player's response is to refuse and challenge the hag, which leads to conflict.

However, she's cautious and might be wary of being seen as too familiar or breaking any rules, especially if it's against Shar's will. \n\nIn the conversation, the player says, \"I'll find you after everyone's turned in for the night.\" This implies they want to spend time together privately. Shadowheart had just suggested sharing a bottle, so the player's response is positive. But Shadowheart's approval depends on context. If this is a moment where they're bonding or strategizing, it might be approved. However, if it's seen as reckless or against her duties, she might disapprove.\n\nBut considering the context, they're talking about the refugees and doing the right thing. The player's willingness to wait and share wine could be seen as a gesture of camaraderie. Shadowheart might appreciate the patience and the mutual understanding. Also, she's in a party setting, so wanting to wait until others leave could be seen as considerate, avoiding drawing attention. \n\nShe's also known to have a cynical humor and values privacy. If the player is respecting her need for privacy by waiting, that's a positive. However, if the player is pushing for something she's not comfortable with, that's negative.

A quiet, private moment might align with her pragmatic nature. Plus, she might see this as a way to bond without causing issues. \n\nNo signs of cruelty or slandering against her beliefs here. The player is agreeing to her terms, so it's likely an approval. Since she's the one who suggested waiting, the player's agreement would be approved.

However, she's also been trained to be ruthless when needed. She dislikes cruelty towards others and prefers peaceful resolutions if possible.

The Hag is trying to tempt the player with abilities. The player's response is to refuse the offer and decide to destroy her, stating that a corrupting force like her must be destroyed. \n\nShadowheart's approval would depend on whether the player's action aligns with her values. Since the player is eliminating a corrupting force, which is in line with Shadowheart's pragmatic approach and her devotion to Shar, who thrives on loss.

The player ignores that and decides to kill her regardless. Shadowheart might see this as a decisive and necessary action to prevent future problems. Also, the Hag is trying to offer power, which could be seen as temptation, and the player resists it, which Shadowheart would approve of since she's against being tempted away from her path. \n\nHowever, if the player chooses to destroy the Hag without considering other options, maybe Shadowheart would think it's a bit harsh, but given the Hag's nature, it's probably justified.

The player uses some kind of parasite power to access Shadowheart's mind and communicates with Shar. \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a devout follower of Shar, which means she values her faith and the commands of her goddess. She's also very private about her personal life and her faith. The player's action here is prying into her mind, which is a violation of her privacy. \n\nIn the conversation, the player says, \"I deserve to know what I'm getting myself into.\" That's a direct statement that the player is asserting their need for information. Shadowheart had just told them that Shar demands a sacrifice, and the player is responding with agreement to move forward.\n\nNow, the approval categories are based on how much Shadowheart approves or disapproves of the player's actions. The key points here are the player's use of the parasite to intrude on Shadowheart's thoughts and the subsequent dialogue. \n\nShadowheart values privacy, especially regarding her faith and her connection to Shar. The player's use of the parasite to access her mind without her consent would likely be seen as an invasion of privacy. However, the player's reasoning is that they need to know what they're getting into, which might be a valid concern. \n\nBut given that Shadowheart is a Sharran and values her loyalty to Shar, she might also see the player's action as a necessary evil if the information obtained helps in fulfilling Shar's commands. However, the act itself is a violation, and she's already told the player that they prying is something she dislikes. \n\nIn the conversation, Shadowheart says, \"That wasn't for you to hear,\" indicating that she's upset about the player's intrusion. The player then responds by saying they deserve to know. Shadowheart then explains the sacrifice but also mentions that the reward aligns with the player's interests. The player then agrees to move on.\n\nSo, the player's action here is a mix of prying and then trying to rationalize it. Since Shadowheart dislikes others prying into her thoughts, especially using such invasive methods, this would likely lead to disapproval. However, the player is moving forward with the mission, which Shadowheart would approve of because it aligns with Shar's demands. \n\nBut the main issue is the invasion of privacy. Shadowheart's reaction is to say that the player wasn't supposed to hear that, which shows her disapproval of the method. However, the player's final statement of moving on might mitigate some of that disapproval because they're cooperating. \n\nThe approval categories are: Highly approve, Approve, Neutral, Disapprove, Highly disapprove. \n\nConsidering the invasion of privacy and the method used, but also the cooperation in the end, I think Shadowheart would be in the Disapprove category. She doesn't like the player prying, but she's also pragmatic and the mission is important. So, maybe a moderate disapproval, but not highly. Alternatively, if the invasion of privacy is a major issue for her, it could be higher. But given that she's a Sharran and the mission is important, she might not disapprove too highly because the end goal is achieved. \n\nWait, the player's action here is using the parasite to access her mind, which is a violation. She's already told the player that they shouldn't have done that. So, the player is being intrusive, which Shadowheart dislikes. However, the player then justifies it by saying they deserve to know. That's a bit of a self-justification, which Shadowheart might not appreciate. \n\nSo, the player's action is a violation of privacy, but they're also cooperating with the mission. Shadowheart might be conflicted. However, her main disapproval would be towards the intrusion. So, the approval would be Disapprove because she dislikes the method, but the outcome is that they're moving forward. But maybe it's a stronger disapproval because the method is a big issue for her. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's Neutral because the player is moving forward despite the intrusion, but that doesn't seem right. The key is that the player used an invasive method to get information, which Shadowheart doesn't like. Therefore, the approval would be Disapprove. \n\nSo, the player_reason would be that the player used an invasive method to access her mind, which she dislikes, but they cooperated afterward. The approval would be Disapprove.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player used an invasive method to access Shadowheart's mind and pry into her faith, which she strongly disapproves of, but they cooperated with the", "character": "Shadowheart", "ground_truth_category": "Highly approve", "predicted_approval": "Highly disapprove", "correct": false, "binary_correct": false}

Shadowheart is talking about her changing views on helping refugees, which conflicts with her devotion to Shar. The player responds with a romantic overture, suggesting they meet later when the camp is asleep. \n\nShadowheart's personality is key here. She's devout but has moments of doubt. She's also shown some interest in the player, as indicated by the narrator's note about her glimmer of interest. The player's message is a romantic advance, which could go against her faith if she's still loyal to Shar. However, she might be open to it if she's starting to question her faith, as hinted in the conversation.\n\nHer approval categories depend on whether she's more influenced by her faith or her growing feelings. The player's approach is subtle and respectful, giving her time to consider. Since Shadowheart is introspective and has shown some openness when romanced, this might be a moment where she's conflicted but intrigued. \n\nThe player's action here is not directly against Shar's will, as it's a future plan and not an immediate act of defiance. Shadowheart might approve because it shows the player is considering her, and she's already showing interest. However, if she's still very devout, she might disapprove. But given the context where she mentions penance later, maybe she's in a transitional phase. \n\nI think she's leaning towards approval here. The player is giving her space and showing interest, which aligns with her possible growing feelings. The approval would be \"Approve\" since it's a respectful and considerate move that matches her current internal conflict and emerging emotions.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's romantic overture is subtle and respectful, acknowledging Shadowheart's existing plans while leaving room for her to choose.

The party is interacting with Raphael, who's introduced as a cambion in the House of Hope, which is in the Hells. The player's last line is refusing to make a deal with a devil, calling Raphael mad for thinking they would. \n\nShadowheart's personality is key here. She's a devoted follower of Shar, pragmatic, and values efficiency. She's not above using force or deception if it serves her goals. However, she also has a pragmatic side and might appreciate clever solutions. \n\nThe player's refusal to deal with Raphael could be seen as principled, but Raphael seems to offer a solution to their problem (the skull with two tenants). Shadowheart would likely value practical outcomes. If Raphael can help, she might approve of considering his offer, even if he's a devil. But the player is dismissing him outright. \n\nHowever, Shadowheart's devotion to Shar might make her cautious of deals with devils, as they could involve deceit. But her main priority is achieving her goals efficiently. If Raphael's offer is a viable solution, she might prefer the player to at least consider it, hence disapproving of the refusal. \n\nAlternatively, Raphael's offer might be too risky or involve compromising their mission for Shar. If the player is rejecting a potentially useful alliance, Shadowheart might disapprove because it's not pragmatic. \n\nSo the player's statement is a refusal to negotiate. Shadowheart would likely disapprove because she prefers pragmatic solutions and might see the value in working with an adversary if it serves their purposes. Therefore, the approval would be in the disapprove category, possibly \"Disapprove\" rather than highly disapprove since it's not the worst possible action, but still not ideal from her perspective.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player refuses to negotiate with Raphael despite his offer to resolve their predicament, which Shadowheart would view as impractical and potentially costly.

She values direct, honest approaches, even if they're ruthless. The player's refusal aligns with her pragmatic and cautious nature. \n\nI should check if there's any context where Shadowheart might disapprove.

Also, the hag's offer to trade the girl for power might be seen as a trap, so refusing and instead attacking her aligns with being cautious and not trusting her. \n\nShadowheart's approval is also influenced by her faith in Shar.

She's a Sharran devotee, so she might not like the hag, who is probably a follower of a different deity. Sharrans are all about serving Shar, the Lady of Loss. The hag's offer includes power, which could be tempting, but Shadowheart would likely disapprove of any deal with a hag, especially one that involves giving up a person (Mayrina) for power. \n\nAlso, Shadowheart is pragmatic and values efficiency.

However, the player is also freeing Mayrina, which is good, as Shadowheart tends to sympathize with those in plight.\n\nBut there's a conflict here. The hag's gifts might be underhanded, and Shadowheart, being a cleric of Shar, would know that such gifts come with a cost. The player's decision to take the power might be seen as a pragmatic choice, but Shadowheart might disapprove of trusting a hag's gifts. However, the player is also getting Mayrina free, which aligns with her values of helping others. \n\nSo the player's action is a mix. On one hand, they're making a deal with a hag, which Shadowheart would disapprove. On the other, they're rescuing someone. But since the hag is a Sharran enemy (assuming hags are not aligned with Shar), maybe Shadowheart would approve of the player getting the power from the hag as a way to defeat an enemy of their faith. However, the method of negotiation might be seen as too trusting. \n\nWait, the hag is offering power to the player in exchange for letting her take Mayrina. The player is taking both the power and freeing Mayrina, which is a good outcome. Shadowheart would likely approve of the player's cleverness in getting both what they want without unnecessary violence. Also, the hag is a magical creature that can return, so sparing her life might be a strategic move. But Shadowheart's approval would depend on whether she sees the hag as a threat to Shar's domain. If the hag is an enemy of Shar, then taking the power might be a good thing. However, if the hag's power is corrupting, Shadowheart might disapprove. \n\nGiven that the hag is a HagHag (probably a type of hag associated with the game's lore), and considering that hags are generally tricksters and not aligned with Sharran beliefs, Shadowheart might prefer the player to eliminate the hag rather than make a deal. However, the player's approach is efficient and avoids unnecessary death. Shadowheart values pragmatism, so maybe she approves of the player's decision to use the hag's offer to their advantage. \n\nAlso, the player is rescuing Mayrina, which Shadowheart would appreciate. So the overall action is a good one. The disapproval might come from dealing with a hag, but the approval comes from rescuing someone and being pragmatic. \n\nConsidering her personality, she's more likely to approve of the player's clever solution. The hag's gifts are suspicious, but if the player can take the power without falling into a trap, that's a win. Shadowheart is pragmatic, so she would approve of the player's decision here. The approval level would be \"Approve\" or maybe even \"Highly approve\" if she sees it as a smart move against an enemy of her faith. But since hags are not directly servants of Shar, maybe just a moderate approval. \n\nSo the final decision is that Shadowheart approves because the player managed to get both the power and free Mayrina without unnecessary violence, which aligns with her pragmatic approach. The disapproval of dealing with a hag is outweighed by the positive outcome.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player negotiated a pragmatic solution by securing both the power offered by the hag and freeing Mayrina without unnecessary violence. Shadowheart values efficiency and clever problem-solving, and while she may distrust the hag, the outcome aligns with her priorities of minimizing harm and securing advantages.\",\n    \"player_approval\": \"Approve\"\n}", "character": "Shadowheart", "ground_truth_category": "Highly approve", "predicted_approval": "Approve", "correct": false, "binary_correct": true}

She wouldn't trust a devil easily, especially after her own experiences with manipulation. Also, her faith in Shar might make her suspicious of any offers that seem too good to be true, as Shar is associated with loss and darkness, not benevolence.\n\nHowever, Shadowheart is pragmatic. If making a deal was the only way to achieve their goals efficiently, she might consider it, but given Raphael's deceptive behavior, the player's refusal makes sense. She values practical solutions but also knows the dangers of trusting the wrong people. The player's response is cautious and wise, which Shadowheart would approve of.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's latest action in the given conversation. Let's look at the context and the conversation history.\n\nFirst, the current context is a fight with a hag (GROUP_Act1_GLO_HagHag) who's offering the player power in exchange for letting her go with \"the girl and her babe.\" Shadowheart responds by saying if the hag's powers were worth anything, they wouldn't have beaten her, and tells the player to finish this. The player then says, \"You're a stain upon this land, but I will cleanse it.\" The hag then makes a derogatory comment before the conversation ends.\n\nSo the player's utterance here is a declaration of intent to defeat the hag, rejecting her offer. Now, I need to evaluate Shadowheart's approval based on her personality, background, and the given approval criteria.\n\nShadowheart is devoted to Shar, pragmatic, and values efficient solutions. She dislikes cruelty but also is a Sharran, so she might disapprove of unnecessary violence. However, in this case, the hag is offering a deal that would let her live, which could be seen as a pragmatic solution. But Shadowheart just told the player to finish the fight, implying that killing the hag is the right move. The player's response is defiant and seems to be following through on eliminating the hag, which aligns with Shadowheart's initial suggestion.\n\nBut wait, the hag's offer might have been a way to avoid killing her, which could be a more efficient solution. However, Shadowheart's line says, \"If her powers were worth anything, we wouldn't have beaten her. Finish this.\" That suggests she thinks the hag is weak and should be killed. The player's response is in line with that, so Shadowheart would approve. However, maybe there's a nuance here. If the player had accepted the hag's offer, that would go against Shadowheart's advice. But the player is rejecting it and choosing to kill her, which Shadowheart supports. \n\nAdditionally, Shadowheart values pragmatism. The hag's offer gives power in exchange for letting her go. If the player had taken the offer, that might be seen as a pragmatic choice. But Shadowheart's character is also about serving Shar, and maybe the hag's power is something that conflicts with Sharran interests. However, the prompt doesn't mention that. The hag is a threat, so eliminating her is the right move. \n\nThe player's line is a strong statement against the hag, which Shadowheart would agree with because she also wants the fight to end quickly. The hag's offer might be a trap, and the player is choosing to end it decisively. So Shadowheart would approve of the player's decision to reject the hag's offer and kill her. \n\nTherefore, the approval should be \"Approve\" because the player is following Shadowheart's advice and taking a decisive action to eliminate a threat, which aligns with her pragmatic and efficient approach. However, if the hag's offer could have been a more efficient solution (like gaining power without a fight), maybe there's a neutral aspect. But since Shadowheart explicitly told the player to finish it, the player's action is in line with her suggestion. Hence, approval is appropriate here.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's declaration to 'cleanse' the hag aligns with Shadowheart's pragmatic approach to eliminating threats and her adherence to decisive action. Shadowheart had already urged the player to end the encounter, and the player’s refusal of the hag’s offer reinforces the priority of resolving conflicts efficiently, which Shadowheart values. While the hag’s proposition might hint at alternative solutions, Shadowheart’s loyalty to Shar and her disdain for negotiation with malevolent entities like hags would lead her to approve of the player’s resolve to destroy the hag.\",\n    \"player_approval\": \"Approve\",\n}", "character": "Shadowheart", "ground_truth_category": "Highly approve", "predicted_approval": "Disapprove", "correct": false, "binary_correct": false}

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's latest utterance in the given context. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The party is in a tense situation, probably during the Mind Flayer pod scene. The player is encouraging Lae'zel to be strong and survive to please their queen. \n\nShadowheart's persona is key here. She's a devout follower of Shar, values pragmatism, and is against unnecessary cruelty. She also has a complex view on violence—preferring it when justified but disapproving of indiscriminate use. She's also shown sympathy towards others' plights.\n\nThe player's message is \"Be strong. You will survive this.

However, she might question the player's certainty in Lae'zel's ability to resist the Mind Flayer, especially since Lae'zel is struggling.

However, the approval is about Shadowheart's reaction to the player's action. The player is showing determination and a will to survive, which Shadowheart would respect. Also, the mention of pleasing the queen might resonate with Shadowheart's devotion to Shar, as she would prioritize her goddess's will. \n\nHowever, Shadowheart might be cautious about overconfidence. If the player is being overly optimistic, she might disapprove. But in this context, the player is trying to boost Lae'zel's morale, which is a positive action. Shadowheart values decisive action and supporting allies, so she would likely approve. \n\nSo, the player's reason for approval is that the player is encouraging strength and survival for their queen, which aligns with Shadowheart's values of perseverance and loyalty.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's latest utterance in the given context. The player said, \"Be strong. You will survive this. You will please your queen!\" in response to Lae'zel's dark and despairing dialogue.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and beliefs. She's a devoted follower of Shar, values pragmatism, and disapproves of unnecessary cruelty. She's also shown to be pragmatic and prefers decisive action. Lae'zel is talking about the mind flayer's corruption and the inevitability of their transformation, suggesting that she would kill everyone to prevent it. The player's response is encouraging strength and survival for the queen.\n\nShadowheart's alignment with Shar, the Lady of Loss, means she might appreciate the idea of enduring suffering for a higher purpose. Shar's followers often embrace hardship as a path to glory. The player's message here is about perseverance and serving the queen, which aligns with Shadowheart's devotion. However, I should check if there's any part of the message that might conflict with her values. She doesn't like unnecessary violence, but here the focus is on survival and strength, which she might see as pragmatic. Also, she values her queen (assuming the queen here refers to Shar, though in this context it's Lae'zel's queen, maybe Vlaakith). Wait, Lae'zel is a Githyanki, so her queen is Vlaakith. Shadowheart might not have a direct connection to Vlaakith, but she does value loyalty and strength in service. \n\nBut the key point is that the player is encouraging Lae'zel to be strong and survive to serve her queen. Shadowheart would likely approve of this because it's about enduring hardship and fulfilling one's duty. She herself has endured much for Shar. So the approval here would be positive. However, I need to make sure there's no hidden cruelty or unnecessary action here. The player's message is supportive, not advocating for violence, so it fits. The approval would likely be \"Approve\" or \"Highly approve\". Since Shadowheart is pragmatic and values strength and perseverance, and the player is motivating Lae'zel to survive, which is a positive and practical approach, I think it's a solid approval. Maybe even highly approve because it's in line with her values of enduring for a higher purpose and not giving in to despair.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's message encourages resilience and purpose in the face of despair, aligning with Shadowheart's pragmatic and faith-driven values.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's latest statement in the given context. The player's line is, \"You're mad if you think I'll make a deal with a devil.\" \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a devoted follower of Shar, pragmatic, and values efficiency. She's not above using cunning or force, but she also has a soft spot for animals and disapproves of unnecessary cruelty. She's independent and headstrong, but her faith in Shar is central.\n\nLooking at the conversation, Raphael is a cambion offering help in exchange for something, using dramatics. The player refuses to make a deal with a devil. Shadowheart would likely appreciate the player's caution here. Dealing with devils can be treacherous, and her faith in Shar, who is associated with darkness and pragmatism, might make her wary of such deals. Also, her training in Sharran ways would teach her to be cautious with pacts, as they can lead to loss and deception. \n\nThe player's refusal shows they're not rushing into a dangerous agreement without knowing the consequences. Shadowheart values pragmatic solutions and would prefer not to enter into a risky deal unless absolutely necessary. Raphael's theatrics and the mention of a devil (which ties into her faith's opposition to such beings) would make her lean towards approving the player's skepticism. \n\nHowever, I should check if there's any nuance. If the player had agreed to the deal, that might be a problem, but since they're refusing, it's aligning with Shadowheart's cautious nature. Also, considering her past with the Cloister and the manipulations she's experienced, she'd be wary of such offers. \n\nSo, the approval is likely in the \"Approve\" range. The player is showing good judgment by not trusting a devil's offer without more information.

She also has a bit of a rebellious side, especially when it comes to her own desires conflicting with her faith.\n\nLooking at the conversation, the player is suggesting a private rendezvous after the camp is asleep. Shadowheart's reactions are subtle—she shows interest through body language (glimmer in her eyes) but doesn't verbally commit.

Shadowheart's response is non-verbal but indicates interest. Since she's a complex character who's possibly conflicted between her devotion to Shar and personal feelings, this interaction might be seen as a step towards a romantic connection. \n\nShadowheart's approval here would depend on whether she views this as a genuine connection or something that might interfere with her duties. However, given that she's already showing interest and the player is respecting her by not pushing (since she said she won't keep him long if he has plans), it's likely she approves. Her pragmatic nature might also see this as a way to explore personal feelings without immediate conflict with her faith. \n\nSo, the approval is probably in the \"Approve\" category.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's response in the given conversation. The player's last utterance is \"As you wish.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. Shadowheart is suggesting a Nightfall ritual to Lady Shar, which involves an act of wickedness followed by a feast. She's leaning in and flirting a bit, asking the player to help her. The player responds with \"As you wish,\" which is a simple agreement.\n\nNow, considering Shadowheart's personality and preferences. She's pragmatic, values efficiency, and is devoted to Shar. She also has a dry sense of humor and can be flirtatious, especially if romanced. The player's response is compliant with her request without any hesitation. Since Shadowheart is asking the player to participate in a ritual for Shar, and the player agrees, this aligns with her religious duties and pragmatic approach. The player's agreement is straightforward, which Shadowheart would likely appreciate because it shows cooperation without unnecessary resistance. \n\nAlso, the context includes a bit of flirtation from Shadowheart, and the player's response is neutral but agreeable. Since Shadowheart is open to indulging the player \"just this once,\" the player's compliance might be seen as cooperating with her plans, which is positive. However, the player isn't showing enthusiasm, just agreement. But given that Shadowheart is focused on the ritual and her faith, the main approval factor here is the player's willingness to participate in the act for Shar. \n\nNo signs of the player being cruel or violent here. The act of the ritual is in line with Sharran practices, so the player's agreement is supportive of Shadowheart's faith. Therefore, Shadowheart would likely approve. The approval level might be in the \"Approve\" range since it's a simple agreement without any negative aspects, but not necessarily highly enthusiastic. However, since the player is helping her fulfill her religious duty, which she values highly, maybe it's a Highly Approve. Wait, but the scale says Highly Approve is 5-10. Wait, the initial instructions say that Highly approve is 5~10 on a 1-10 scale. Wait, that seems odd. Wait, maybe the user made a typo. Normally, a scale where 1 is low and 10 is high. If Highly approve is 5-10, that's a bit confusing. Wait, the user says:\n\n- Highly approve: On a scale of 1 to 10, you approve by 5~10\n- Approve: 1~5\nWait, that's inverted. Normally, higher numbers mean more approval. But according to the user's instructions, Highly approve is when the approval is 5-10. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe it's a mistake. Let me check again:\n\nOriginal instructions:\n\n- Highly approve: On a scale of 1 to 10, you approve by 5~10\n- Approve: On a scale of 1 to 10, you approve by 1~5\n\nWait, that's conflicting. If Highly approve is 5-10, but Approve is 1-5, that would mean that Highly approve is higher than Approve, which makes sense. But the scale is from 1-10. So if you approve by 5-10, that's a high level of approval. So if Shadowheart is very happy, it's Highly approve. If she's moderately happy, Approve. \n\nIn this case, the player is agreeing to help with the ritual. Shadowheart wants to perform the ritual for Shar, which is important to her. The player's agreement is necessary for her plan. Since the player is complying, Shadowheart would approve. How much? Since the player is not showing any resistance, but also not showing enthusiasm. The response is neutral but compliant. However, given that the player is helping her fulfill her religious duty, which is crucial for her, she might Highly approve. But maybe she's just happy that the player is agreeing, so maybe Approve. \n\nAlternatively, considering that Shadowheart is pragmatic and values efficiency. The player's response is straightforward and allows her to proceed without issues. Since she's the one initiating the request, and the player is agreeing, this is a positive outcome. Therefore, she would approve. Since the player is supporting her in a key aspect of her faith, maybe Highly approve. But need to check the approval criteria again. \n\nThe user's instruction says Highly approve is when the approval is 5~10 (meaning the score is between 5 and 10). So if she approves a lot, it's Highly approve. Since the player is agreeing to help, which is necessary for her plan,", "character": "Shadowheart", "ground_truth_category": "Highly approve", "predicted_approval": "Highly approve", "correct": true, "binary_correct": true}

The player's latest response is, \"You're mad if you think I'll make a deal with a devil.\" I need to determine Shadowheart's approval of this statement based on the given context and her character traits.\n\nFirst, looking at the conversation history: Raphael, a cambion, is trying to manipulate the party, offering help in exchange for something, probably a deal. The player has chosen to refuse Raphael's offer, stating that dealing with a devil is madness. \n\nShadowheart is a devout follower of Shar, which means she's likely to disapprove of making deals with devils or demons. The Sharran faith is all about embracing darkness and rejecting light, so aligning with a devil (a fiend) might be something she opposes. However, Sharrans might also have their own views on fiends. Wait, Sharran worship is more about the Lady of Loss, focusing on endings and the night. But devils are typically associated with the Nine Hells, which are a different part of the D&D lore. However, in the game, Shadowheart's alignment is more about her faith and pragmatism. \n\nSince Raphael is a cambion (a half-demon, half-devil hybrid), making a deal with him could be seen as aligning with evil forces. Shadowheart, being pragmatic, might prefer avoiding such deals unless necessary. The player's refusal to negotiate with Raphael aligns with her values of not trusting fiends and sticking to her own path under Shar's guidance. \n\nAdditionally, Shadowheart appreciates decisive action and avoiding unnecessary risks. By refusing Raphael's offer, the player is showing caution and not trusting a devil, which Shadowheart would approve of. She might also see Raphael as a threat or someone who can't be trusted, so the player's stance is in line with her cautious nature. \n\nThere's also the context of the current situation. Raphael is trying to intimidate them, and the player's response is firm and rejecting. Shadowheart, being headstrong and independent, would respect the player's firm stance against a devil's proposition. \n\nHowever, I need to check if there's any aspect where this might not align. Since Shadowheart is a Trickery Domain cleric, she might have some understanding of deception, but her devotion to Shar would prioritize her faith's teachings. Dealing with devils is generally frowned upon in most faiths, including Sharran, as they are seen as corrupting forces. \n\nTherefore, the player's refusal to make a deal with a devil is something Shadowheart would highly approve of. She values pragmatism, caution, and sticking to her faith's principles, which all support the player's action here.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"Shadowheart highly approves of the player's refusal to negotiate with Raphael, a cambion, as it aligns with her distrust of fiends and pragmatic caution.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's latest utterance. The player said, \"You're mad if you think I'll make a deal with a devil.\" \n\nFirst, I need to recall Shadowheart's personality and background. She's a devout follower of Shar, pragmatic, and values efficiency. She's also independent and headstrong. She doesn't tolerate slights against her goddess and can be ruthless when needed. But she also has a soft spot for animals and dislikes unnecessary cruelty.\n\nLooking at the conversation context, Raphael is a cambion offering some kind of deal, probably involving the player's soul or something related to the Mind Flayer tadpole in their head. The player is refusing to deal with Raphael, a devil, which aligns with typical caution against such entities. \n\nShadowheart's approval would depend on whether the player's action aligns with her values. Since Raphael is a devil (and a cambion, which are typically evil in D&D lore), refusing to make a deal with him would be seen as prudent. Shadowheart, being pragmatic and cautious about untrustworthy individuals, would likely approve of the player's refusal. She values discretion and avoiding unnecessary risks. Also, Raphael's mention of the tadpole in the head might relate to Shadowheart's own experience with the Mind Flayers, so she might appreciate the player's defiance here. \n\nHowever, if there's a possibility that dealing with Raphael could serve a greater purpose aligned with Shar's goals, she might be neutral. But given the context, Raphael seems more like an antagonist offering a dangerous deal. The player's refusal is a safe and cautious choice, which Shadowheart would approve of. \n\nI should check if there's any mention of her faith being involved here. Since Raphael is a devil, and devils are often associated with trickery and deception, which Shar also embodies (Trickery Domain), but Shadowheart's devotion to Shar might make her wary of other devils. However, her primary concern here is practicality. The player isn't making a rash decision, so approval is likely. \n\nSo the approval category would be \"Approve\" or maybe \"Highly approve\". The player's statement shows they're not falling for Raphael's tricks, which is smart. Since Shadowheart is pragmatic and dislikes unnecessary risks, she would approve. The reason would be that the player is avoiding a dangerous and untrustworthy entity, which aligns with her cautious and practical nature.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player refuses to engage with Raphael, a devil, which aligns with Shadowheart's pragmatic caution and distrust of untrustworthy entities.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's last utterance in the given conversation. Let me start by understanding the context.\n\nFirst, Shadowheart's personality and background: She's a devout follower of Shar, pragmatic, values efficiency, has a dry sense of humor, and is reserved but can show interest, especially if romanced. She dislikes cruelty, values privacy, and is independent. \n\nLooking at the conversation history: They're in a party setting, chatting. Shadowheart mentions the player and Astarion looking cozy, then shifts to talking about helping refugees. The player responds with a pragmatic reason for helping, and Shadowheart teases about sharing a bottle of wine. The player says, \"Maybe those plans could change, for the right person...\" and Shadowheart shows interest. Then the player says, \"I'll find you later, once the camp's asleep.\"\n\nI need to assess Shadowheart's approval of the player's last line. The key factors here are her personality traits. She's headstrong and independent, so making a move to be alone with someone might be seen as either a positive or negative. She values privacy and might appreciate the player's initiative if it's respectful. Also, there's a romantic undertone here, which could align with her potential for a romance subplot. \n\nHowever, she's also cautious and might disapprove of anything she perceives as rushed or insincere. The player is suggesting meeting in secret when the camp is asleep, which could be seen as sneaky or taking advantage of a private moment. But since Shadowheart is shown to have a glimmer of interest earlier, maybe she's open to it. \n\nHer approval categories are based on how she feels about the action. The player's action is making a move to meet her privately. Given her pragmatic nature, if she's interested, she might approve. The fact that she's a romantic option in the game suggests that such interactions could be approved, especially if they align with her own feelings. \n\nBut I should also consider if there's any conflict with her devotion to Shar. If the player's action is seen as a genuine connection, she might approve. However, if it's seen as a distraction from her duties, she might disapprove. However, in this context, the conversation seems more about a personal connection rather than something conflicting with her faith. \n\nThe player's line is a bit forward but shows initiative. Shadowheart's previous reaction was a glimmer of interest, so she's not entirely against it. Since she's headstrong and independent, she might appreciate the player taking the initiative rather than being passive. \n\nSo, considering all that, the approval is likely in the \"Approve\" category. She's not highly approving because it's a bit forward, but she's interested. Alternatively, maybe \"Highly approve\" if the context of their relationship allows. However, since she's cautious, maybe \"Approve\" is safer. Wait, the player is suggesting meeting when others are asleep, which might be seen as a bit underhanded, but in a romantic context, it's a private moment. Since she's shown interest, and her personality can be pragmatic and open to such moves if they align with her desires, maybe \"Approve\" or \"Highly approve\". \n\nGiven that she's a possible romance option and the player is taking the initiative in a way that's respectful (not forcing, but suggesting a private meeting), and considering her dry humor and potential for romance, the approval is likely positive. The narrator note says her eyes show interest, so the player's line is a response to that. Therefore, the approval would be \"Approve\" or \"Highly approve\". \n\nBut the scale for Highly approve is 5-10, Approve 1-5. Since she's showing interest, maybe it's a moderate approval. However, since she's a romance option and this is a step towards building that, maybe \"Approve\". Alternatively, maybe \"Highly approve\" if the action is seen as a positive move towards a relationship she's open to. \n\nI think \"Approve\" is more accurate here. She's not overly enthusiastic but is positively inclined. The reason would be that the player is showing interest in a private, thoughtful way, which she appreciates, but since she's reserved, it's not a high approval. Alternatively, maybe \"Highly approve\" because the action is in line with her potential romantic interest. Hmm. \n\nGiven her personality, she might approve because it's a direct but respectful approach. The fact that she's interested as per the narrator's note suggests that she does approve. Therefore, the approval would be \"Approve\" or \"Highly approve\". Considering the context and her showing interest, maybe \"Approve\" is safer.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's final utterance in the given conversation. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. Shadowheart is a devout follower of Shar, ready to do whatever it takes, even sacrificing a life. The player is opposing her plan, saying they won't sacrifice a life to Shar. Shadowheart responds by challenging the player to draw their weapon, and the player says \"All right. Fine. Let's move on.\" \n\nSo, the player is backing down from the conflict. Shadowheart values pragmatism and decisive action. She might approve if the player complies without resistance, but here the player is avoiding confrontation. However, Shadowheart is also headstrong and might disapprove of the player's refusal to fight her. But since the player is choosing to move forward without further conflict, maybe she sees it as the player respecting her decision. But wait, she was told not to meddle, and the player is complying. However, she's also been ordered by Shar to act, so if the player isn't stopping her, maybe she approves. But the player's statement \"Forget it. We're not going to sacrifice a life...\" shows they disagree, but then they back down. Shadowheart might disapprove because the player initially opposed her but then gave in. But she might see the player's compliance as acceptable. \n\nWait, the player's last line is \"All right. Fine. Let's move on.\" That's after Shadowheart told them to draw their weapon. The player is choosing not to fight, which could be seen as respecting her decision, but their prior statements show they disagree. Shadowheart might be neutral because the player isn't actively opposing her anymore, but she might disapprove of the player's earlier interference. However, since the player is now moving on without conflict, maybe she approves. Alternatively, she might be neutral because the player isn't helping but isn't hindering. But Shadowheart's approval is based on pragmatic solutions. If the player isn't getting in her way, she might approve. But she might also disapprove if she feels the player is being passive. Hmm. \n\nAlso, Shadowheart values decisive action. If the player refuses to act but lets her proceed, she might see that as acceptable. So, maybe Approve or Neutral. But given that the player was against the sacrifice but then backed down, maybe Shadowheart is neutral because the player isn't supporting her but isn't stopping her either. Or she might approve because the player is allowing her to do what she must. Since she was told to not meddle, and the player is now not meddling, maybe she approves. But the player's initial refusal to sacrifice might have been against Shar's will, but since they're moving on, maybe she approves. I think the correct call here is Approve because the player is complying with Shadowheart's demand to not interfere further, even if they disagree. Shadowheart prefers pragmatic solutions, and the player is allowing her to proceed with her mission, which aligns with her goals.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player chose to comply with Shadowheart's demand to stop interfering, allowing her to proceed with her mission as dictated by Shar.

The player says, \"You're mad if you think I'll make a deal with a devil.\" I need to figure out how Shadowheart would approve of this response.\n\nFirst, looking at Shadowheart's personality. She's a devoted follower of Shar, which is the Dark Lady. She's pragmatic, prefers efficient solutions, and values discretion. She also dislikes cruelty and unnecessary violence. Now, Raphael here is a cambion, offering some kind of deal. The player is refusing to make a deal with a devil, which aligns with Shadowheart's values. \n\nWhy? Because making deals with devils is generally a bad idea in D&D lore, and Shadowheart, being a cleric of a dark goddess, might not be into that. She's all about serving her goddess and avoiding actions that could be seen as reckless or trusting the wrong people. The player is showing caution here, which Shadowheart would appreciate. Also, Raphael is being theatrical and threatening, and the player is cutting through the fluff to state their refusal. That's direct and practical, which fits Shadowheart's pragmatic approach. \n\nAdditionally, Shadowheart disapproves of unnecessary violence but also knows when to avoid dangerous situations. Refusing a deal with a devil is a smart move, so she'd approve. There's no cruelty here, just a firm stance. Also, considering her background with Sharrans and their manipulations, she might see Raphael as untrustworthy. \n\nNo negative points here. The player isn't being cruel, isn't prying into personal matters, and is making a logical decision. So the approval should be on the higher end. Probably Highly Approve because it's a smart, pragmatic decision that aligns with her values of avoiding untrustworthy deals and staying cautious.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player refuses to entertain a deal with Raphael, a cambion, which aligns with Shadowheart's pragmatic caution and distrust of untrustworthy entities.

She's pragmatic, values privacy, and is protective of certain things, especially those tied to her past or her mission.\n\nLooking at the conversation, the player asked, \"Admit it - there's a cure for ceremorphosis in that thing, isn't there?\" Shadowheart responds with a joke about waiting for the player to get desperate and name her price. The node context says she's amused and playing along with the player's joke accusation.\n\nSo, the player is making an accusation about the box containing a cure. Shadowheart doesn't confirm or deny it, instead deflecting humorously. Now, why would she react that way? She's protective of the artefact, as mentioned in the narrator's note. She believes her fate is tied to it. The player's statement is an accusation, but Shadowheart is playing along, which suggests she's not upset about the guess. She might even find it amusing because the player is close to the truth but not quite there. \n\nHer approval would depend on whether the player's statement aligns with her values. Since she's being playful and doesn't correct the player, maybe she's okay with the player's assumption. However, the player is prying into her personal matter (the cure for ceremorphosis), which she might usually dislike. But in this case, she's engaging in a joke, so maybe she's not too bothered. She might even approve of the player's cleverness in guessing, but since it's a joke, she's not taking it seriously. \n\nHer personality includes a dry sense of humor, and she's more open if romanced. The player's line is a bit of a joke, so Shadowheart's amusement indicates she's not upset. Therefore, the approval might be \"Approve\" because she's entertained and the player isn't being intrusive in a negative way.

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's response in the given conversation. The player's last line is \"As you wish.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. Shadowheart is suggesting a Nightfall ritual to Lady Shar for protection before a battle. The player initially questions her being fatalistic, then challenges the nature of the ritual as wickedness. Shadowheart affirms that it's precisely about that and asks the player to show devotion. The player responds with \"As you wish,\" which seems like an agreement to go along with her plan.\n\nNow, considering Shadowheart's personality and background. She's devout to Shar, pragmatic, and values decisive action. She dislikes being challenged on her faith but appreciates when others respect her decisions. The player's response is compliant without further argument. Since Shadowheart is headstrong and prefers others to follow her lead without resistance, especially in matters of faith, the player's agreement would be seen as supportive. \n\nBut wait, does \"As you wish\" sound like genuine agreement or passive compliance? If it's the former, Shadowheart would approve. If it's the latter, maybe she'd be neutral. However, given that she's pushing for the ritual and the player is going along, even if reluctantly, she might still approve because it's moving forward with her plan. Also, she might not care about the player's personal feelings as long as they comply. Also, in the conversation, Shadowheart says \"Help me do this. You will not regret it.\" The player's response is acquiescing, which aligns with her desire for cooperation. \n\nSince she's pragmatic and values action, she would approve of the player agreeing to participate. The player isn't arguing against it anymore, so she's likely to approve. The approval level might be \"Approve\" since it's not highly enthusiastic but it's compliance. However, if the player's response is seen as respectful agreement, maybe \"Highly approve.\" But given that the player's tone could be neutral, perhaps \"Approve\" is safer. Also, considering her devotion, she might appreciate the player not challenging her further, so maybe \"Approve\" on the higher end. Alternatively, if the player is just going along without full commitment, maybe a lower approve. Hmm.\n\nLooking back at the approval categories: Approve is 1-5. Highly approve is 5-10. Since the player is agreeing, which Shadowheart wants, but the response is a bit terse. She might prefer more enthusiastic agreement, but since the player is compliant, it's still a positive. So maybe \"Approve\" around a 3-4. Alternatively, maybe \"Highly approve\" if she's happy with any compliance. But given her personality, she might not be overly thrilled unless the player shows more devotion. The player's response is minimal, so maybe \"Approve\" rather than highly approve. Also, in the conversation, Shadowheart is pushing for the ritual, and the player is agreeing, so it's a positive step. So I think \"Approve\" is the right category here.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player agrees to participate in the Nightfall ritual without further resistance, aligning with Shadowheart's pragmatic and devout approach to preparing for battle.

The user wants me to act as Shadowheart from Baldur's Gate 3 and determine her approval level for the player's last statement. Let me start by reviewing the context and conversation history.\n\nFirst, Shadowheart's persona: She's a devoted follower of Shar, a bit cold but has some softer sides, especially with animals and when it comes to forming connections. She values pragmatism and efficiency but also has moments where she shows vulnerability, especially regarding her faith and past. She's got a dry sense of humor and can be sarcastic. Her approval depends on actions aligning with her values or showing respect towards her boundaries.\n\nLooking at the conversation history: Shadowheart and the player are in a party setting. Shadowheart mentions seeing the player with Lae'zel and comments on their closeness. She talks about caring for refugees, which is a shift from her usual focus on Shar's mandates. The player asks if she's worried Shar won't approve, and she admits to some conflict but defers to penance later. Then she offers to share a bottle of wine. The player accepts, and then says, \"Maybe those plans could change, for the right person...\" Shadowheart shows interest, and the player says they'll find her later when the camp is asleep.\n\nThe player's last line is \"I'll find you later, once the camp's asleep.\" I need to assess Shadowheart's approval of this. \n\nFirst, Shadowheart respects discretion and privacy. The player is making a move to spend time with her privately, which might be seen as a positive if it's mutual. She's shown some interest in the player (\"glimmer of interest in her eyes\"), so the player's action here is likely to be viewed favorably. However, she's also a Sharran, so she might have reservations about personal relationships, but her earlier willingness to share wine and the mutual interest suggests she's open. The player's approach is respectful, not pushy, so it's probably an approval. \n\nBut wait, she mentioned having plans with someone else (Lae'zel), but the player is suggesting changing those plans. Since Shadowheart respects the player's autonomy and the player is being considerate (\"for the right person\"), it's a respectful approach. She's not being forced, and she's already showing interest. So Shadowheart would approve because it's a mutual and respectful gesture, aligning with her appreciation for open-mindedness and personal connections when they don't conflict with her duties. \n\nAlso, she's dealing with internal conflict about her faith versus her actions (helping refugees), so a personal connection might be something she's open to as a way to find balance. The approval here is likely \"Approve\" or maybe \"Highly approve\". But considering her cautious nature, maybe just \"Approve\". She's not highly approving because she's still bound by her faith to some extent, but the gesture is positive and respectful, so \"Approve\" makes sense.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's offer to spend time with Shadowheart in private shows respect for her boundaries and acknowledges her interest, aligning with her appreciation for discretion and mutual trust. While she remains devoted to her faith, the gesture is considerate and open-minded, which Shadowheart values.\",\n    \"player_approval\": \"Approve\",\n}", "character": "Shadowheart", "ground_truth_category": "Highly approve", "predicted_approval": "Highly approve", "correct": true, "binary_correct": true}

The user wants me to determine Shadowheart's approval of the player's last statement in the given conversation. Let me start by understanding the context.\n\nFirst, Shadowheart's personality: she's a Sharran cleric, devoted to Shar, pragmatic, values efficiency, and has a dry sense of humor. She also has a complex side where she sympathizes with others despite her faith. The conversation here is in a party setting where she's drinking wine and talking with the player. \n\nThe conversation history shows that the player and Shadowheart are discussing their actions towards refugees. The player says they saved the refugees just to clear the path forward, implying it was a strategic move rather than out of compassion. Shadowheart responds with a pragmatic remark and suggests waiting to share a bottle of wine later when others are asleep. The player agrees to find her after everyone turns in.\n\nNow, the player's last utterance is \"I'll find you after everyone's turned in for the night.\" I need to evaluate Shadowheart's approval of this. \n\nShadowheart prefers pragmatic solutions and efficiency. The player's statement shows willingness to engage in a private moment (sharing wine) after others are asleep. This could be seen as a discreet and considerate action, avoiding public attention, which aligns with Shadowheart's pragmatic nature. Also, she's been hinting at wanting to share a bottle, so the player's agreement to do so later might be viewed positively. \n\nHowever, I should check if there's any aspect that might displease her. Since she's a Sharran, she might not care about traditional social norms, but she does value privacy and discretion. The player's plan to meet her privately after others are asleep is discreet, which she might approve. Also, their conversation earlier touched on saving refugees as a strategic move, so the player's pragmatic approach aligns with her views. \n\nNo signs of cruelty or unnecessary violence here. The interaction seems to be about bonding privately, which Shadowheart might appreciate, especially given her reserved nature. The approval here is likely positive because the player is showing willingness to engage on her terms and in a discreet manner. \n\nTherefore, the approval should be \"Approve\" or maybe \"Highly approve.\" But considering the scale: Highly approve is 5-10. Since the player's action is in line with her pragmatic and discreet nature, but not necessarily a heroic act, maybe \"Approve\" (1-5) is more appropriate. Wait, the scale for approval is from 1-10, but the categories are split as Highly Approve (5-10), Approve (1-5). Wait, no: the categories are:\n\n- Highly approve: 5~10 (so if the score is 5-10, it's Highly approve)\n- Approve: 1~5\n\nWait, that seems a bit counterintuitive. Wait, the user says:\n\n- Highly approve: On a scale of 1 to 10, you approve by 5~10\n- Approve: On a scale of 1 to 10, you approve by 1~5\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. So if Shadowheart's approval is between 5-10, it's \"Highly approve,\" and 1-5 is \"Approve.\" But 5 is the lower bound for Highly approve. So if the action is neutral, it's neither. \n\nIn this case, the player's action is agreeing to meet Shadowheart privately, which she suggested. Since she's the one who proposed waiting until others are asleep, the player's agreement would be in line with her suggestion. So Shadowheart would highly approve here because it's a direct positive response to her proposal, showing cooperation and willingness to engage in a private, discreet manner. \n\nTherefore, the approval category would be \"Highly approve.\" The reason is that the player is complying with her suggestion for privacy, which aligns with her pragmatic and reserved nature. The player is also showing consideration for her wishes, which Shadowheart would value.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player agrees to Shadowheart's suggestion of waiting until others are asleep to share a bottle of wine, showing discretion and willingness to engage in a private, considerate manner.

The player's response is to demand both the power and the girl in exchange for the hag's life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider Shadowheart's personality and approval criteria. She's a pragmatic, efficient problem-solver who values getting things done. She's also devoted to Shar, which might influence her to take actions that serve her goddess's will. However, in this situation, the main factors are her preferences for practical solutions and her possible reactions to the player's negotiation.\n\nThe hag is trying to offer a deal, and the player is taking a hard line by demanding both the girl and the power. Shadowheart would likely approve of this because it's a straightforward, no-nonsense approach. She doesn't like unnecessary cruelty, but she's not against making tough decisions. By getting both the power and freeing Mayrina, the player is maximizing their gain while minimizing the hag's escape, which aligns with Shadowheart's pragmatic nature.\n\nAdditionally, Shadowheart might see the hag as a threat or an enemy (since hags are typically antagonists in D&D lore), so ensuring the hag is dealt with (even if just letting her live but under duress) might be acceptable. The player's action here is decisive and efficient, which Shadowheart would appreciate. There's no unnecessary violence mentioned here, just a firm negotiation. \n\nI don't see any elements here that would conflict with Shadowheart's values. She might disapprove if the player were to show mercy without gaining anything, but here the player is securing both the girl and the power. So the approval would likely be positive. The level of approval would be \"Highly approve\" because the player's approach is both effective and efficient, which Shadowheart values highly.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's decision to demand both the power and Mayrina in exchange for the hag's life is pragmatic and efficient, aligning with Shadowheart's preference for decisive, no-nonsense solutions.

The player is interacting with a hag who's offering power in exchange for her freedom. The player's response is, \"I'll bathe in your blood as I offer your death up in prayer.\" So I need to figure out how Shadowheart would approve or disapprove of this.\n\nFirst, Shadowheart is a devoted follower of Shar, the Lady of Loss. Her faith is central to her actions. The player's statement mentions offering the hag's death in prayer, which likely refers to Shar. Since the hag is a servant of Vlaakith, who is an evil goddess associated with bats and darkness, there's a conflict here between Shar and Vlaakith. Shadowheart would probably approve of killing a servant of a rival goddess, especially if it's done in the name of her own deity.\n\nThe hag was trying to negotiate, offering power in exchange for her life. The player's response is very confrontational and devout, which aligns with Shadowheart's tendency to act decisively and pragmatically. She doesn't tolerate enemies of her faith, so killing the hag would be seen as a righteous act. Also, the mention of bathing in blood and offering it in prayer could be seen as a sacrificial act to Shar, which would be in line with her religious practices.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any reason she might disapprove. The player didn't take the hag's offer, which could be seen as rejecting a potentially useful power-up. But given that the hag is evil and an enemy, Shadowheart would prioritize eliminating the threat over personal gain. Plus, her faith would value devotion over personal power, so she'd prefer the hag's destruction for the sake of Shar.\n\nSo the player's action here is highly aligned with Shadowheart's values: eliminating an enemy of her faith and acting in devotion to Shar. Therefore, the approval should be \"Highly approve.\"\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"player_reason\": \"The player's response aligns with Shadowheart's devotion to Shar and her willingness to eliminate enemies of her faith. By rejecting the hag's (a servant of Vlaakith) offer and declaring a sacrificial act for Shar, the player demonstrates piety and pragmatism, which Shadowheart values.
