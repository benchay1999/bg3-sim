Move along.\nPlayer: You're going to want to see this. Show her the murder target list.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: Gods... This is it. The proof that I was right!\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: I've been working on an assignment, see - a research project of sorts. I knew my conclusions were sound, but this... I never expected this.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: I'll tell you what I know.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: A century ago, there was a man - Sarevok Anchev. He was a child of the god of murder, Bhaal.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: He ruled the Iron Throne - a dark tower hiding a darker secret. It was the front for a deadly arms-dealing network.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: There, Sarevok amassed an army and sought to become a god. Under his stewardship, the Bhaal Temple was revived, and with it, the Bhaal cult itself.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: Fortunately, the Temple was destroyed, and to cleanse the city of Sarevok's memory, the Iron Throne was torn from its foundations and cast into the Chionthar.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: For most, that was the end of it. But cults like that don't disappear overnight. That list you spoke of confirms I'm right.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: The Bhaal cult is back, and someone is out there, continuing Sarevok's work.\nPlayer: Not only is the cult back, it's spreading fast. I ran into some Bhaalists in the park.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: No doubt you found a trail of bodies in their wake?\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: The brutality of the killings is on a par with Sarevok's own. But there's something more here, something new...\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: There's a reverence to these murders, a certain flair. It's as if they were done in worship.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: The precision of the cuts, the depth, the execution - the best butchers in Faerûn couldn't make a cut like that. Trust me, I've asked them.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: I tried to explain all this to my superiors, but they wouldn't have any of it.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: They told me to drop it. Told me the city doesn't need another conspiracy theorist and to get back to doing my job before they find someone else to do it for me.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: But you - you're not bound by such constraints. Help me out, here. Help the city out.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: I'll bet if you follow the trail of these murders, you'll be able to unearth the truth of this resurgence.\nPlayer: I've got better things to do than investigate a cult.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: I suppose it was quite an ask... but perhaps you wouldn't mind doing me a different, smaller favour?\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: There are patriars on the murder target list. I'm oathbound to secure them first, so I'll be heading to the Upper City next.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: While I'm there, the other potential victims will be at risk.

Move along.\nPlayer: You're going to want to see this. Show her the murder target list.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: Gods... This is it. The proof that I was right!\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: I've been working on an assignment, see - a research project of sorts. I knew my conclusions were sound, but this... I never expected this.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: I'll tell you what I know.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: A century ago, there was a man - Sarevok Anchev. He was a child of the god of murder, Bhaal.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: He ruled the Iron Throne - a dark tower hiding a darker secret. It was the front for a deadly arms-dealing network.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: There, Sarevok amassed an army and sought to become a god. Under his stewardship, the Bhaal Temple was revived, and with it, the Bhaal cult itself.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: Fortunately, the Temple was destroyed, and to cleanse the city of Sarevok's memory, the Iron Throne was torn from its foundations and cast into the Chionthar.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: For most, that was the end of it. But cults like that don't disappear overnight. That list you spoke of confirms I'm right.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: The Bhaal cult is back, and someone is out there, continuing Sarevok's work.\nPlayer: I think it may be a Bhaalspawn...\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: Gods save us all if you're right, but I'd believe it. Whoever it is, they are intimately familiar with Sarevok's work.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: The brutality of the killings is on a par with Sarevok's own. But there's something more here, something new...\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: There's a reverence to these murders, a certain flair. It's as if they were done in worship.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: The precision of the cuts, the depth, the execution - the best butchers in Faerûn couldn't make a cut like that. Trust me, I've asked them.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: I tried to explain all this to my superiors, but they wouldn't have any of it.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: They told me to drop it. Told me the city doesn't need another conspiracy theorist and to get back to doing my job before they find someone else to do it for me.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: But you - you're not bound by such constraints. Help me out, here.

But - one more thing...\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: There are patriars on the murder target list.
