She sought a githyanki egg.\nHavkelaag: Yes, dear Lady Esther. One of our most reliable contractors, though unfortunately this particular request was too much even for her.\nHavkelaag: I believe she quite lost her senses over the task.

Evil, if you will.\nHavkelaag: As citizens of the Underdark, we face similar stigmas. Totally unfounded, of course - our natures are as unfixed as any who walk the surface.\nHavkelaag: I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: You're letting your personal biases affect your method. Why assume they're evil?\nHavkelaag: I assume nothing. Innate githyanki cruelty is an established fact - no doubt you witnessed it yourself in the retrieval of the egg itself.\nHavkelaag: When I have a suitable sample for my study, I will, however, prove that the effects of their biological inclination are reversible.\nHavkelaag: Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach:\nHavkelaag: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue.\nHavkelaag: Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: You would teach the child virtue, but rear it without patience. Curious.\nHavkelaag: Tell me, then, philosopher - if patience delays the fostering of the other virtues, can it be rightly called virtuous?\nPlayer: Perhaps not. Patience is important, but cannot impede the other virtues.\nHavkelaag: Then we are in accord - the time for action is now.\nHavkelaag: My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: An experiment like this will only confirm the surface dwellers' suspicion of us.\nHavkelaag: Of course it won't.

Don't you dare consider it.\nPlayer: What are you going to do with it?\nHavkelaag: Study it, of course. The githyanki have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months.\nHavkelaag: You are no doubt aware that citizens of the Underdark are held in great suspicion by those who live above ground. Many believe us to be 'evil'.\nHavkelaag: The githyanki face similar prejudice, but I believe, if hatched in a less violent, more intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome its evil predispositions.\nHavkelaag: I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: You're letting your personal biases affect your method. Why assume they're evil?\nHavkelaag: I assume nothing. Innate githyanki cruelty is an established fact - no doubt you witnessed it yourself in the retrieval of the egg itself.\nHavkelaag: When I have a suitable sample for my study, I will, however, prove that the effects of their biological inclination are reversible.\nHavkelaag: Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach:\nHavkelaag: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue.\nHavkelaag: Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: So you, too, follow the teachings of Bahamut. Why him?\nHavkelaag: In my years of study, they're the closest I've found to moral perfection. Only under such rigorous 'goodness' will the subject stand a chance of being cured.\nHavkelaag: My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: No benefit could justify you inflicting such cruelty.\nHavkelaag: Rigorous experimental methods demand we do not indulge our own emotional responses in the application of discomfort to our subjects.\nHavkelaag: Only by the full, uninhibited application of psionic stimuli will we have a true measure of whether the child's innate evil has been cured.\nHavkelaag: Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg?

Don't you dare consider it.\nPlayer: What are you going to do with it?\nHavkelaag: Study it, of course. The githyanki have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months.\nHavkelaag: You are no doubt aware that citizens of the Underdark are held in great suspicion by those who live above ground. Many believe us to be 'evil'.\nHavkelaag: The githyanki face similar prejudice, but I believe, if hatched in a less violent, more intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome its evil predispositions.\nHavkelaag: I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: What does this 'intellectually stimulating' upbringing look like?\nHavkelaag: In the literal sense, I will need to induce the egg to hatch via the application of certain currents to the creature inside.\nHavkelaag: Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach:\nHavkelaag: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue.\nHavkelaag: Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: You would teach the child virtue, but rear it without patience. Curious.\nHavkelaag: Tell me, then, philosopher - if patience delays the fostering of the other virtues, can it be rightly called virtuous?\nPlayer: Patience does not delay, it simply tempers virtue. Curtails it from excess.\nHavkelaag: A cautious, hesitant instinct. One I am afraid we do not have time for.\nHavkelaag: My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: Sounds pointless. Public opinion will hardly be swayed by such a small experiment.\nHavkelaag: Not at first. But if the experiment proves successful, it must be repeated. Only then will we know if the findings are to be trusted.\nHavkelaag: Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg?

Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy.\nMalus Thorm: Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself.

What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being?\nMalus Thorm: If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: But you: look how the succour of Shar eludes you.

See how painfully present you remain...\nMalus Thorm: We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: Their blades are uneven.

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon’s voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar.\nMalus Thorm: See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy.\nMalus Thorm: Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke. We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace.\nMalus Thorm: Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver.\nMalus Thorm: Come. Step forward. I can see the love of Shar darken your eyes. Be welcome.\nPlayer: May Shar guide your blessing hands.\nMalus Thorm: And the rough vessels that are yours.\nMalus Thorm: Tell me, what is the guiding principle of the goddess?\nPlayer: Loss.\nMalus Thorm: I profess there is another more profound.\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence.

What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being?\nMalus Thorm: If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: But you: look how the succour of Shar eludes you. See how painfully present you remain...\nMalus Thorm: We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: Your subject is tainted. Shar's succour must only be granted to the willing.\nMalus Thorm: Hmmm. 'Only the willing may know the Lady's embrace.'
