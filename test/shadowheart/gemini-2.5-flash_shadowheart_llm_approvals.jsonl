You can't blame them for Gortash's actions.\nWulbren Bongle: I can blame them for precisely that reason.\nPlayer: I still don't buy it. Would you blame a mage for how the spells they wrote are used?\nWulbren Bongle: These Gondians are not poor, unknowing mages scribbling spell scrolls for Minute Meteors or Acid Arrows. They are complicit.\nWulbren Bongle: They've always been happy to provide their technology to despots in exchange for a stipend and the freedom to work in peace.\nWulbren Bongle: They would have licked Sarevok's boots given the chance, and now they'll kiss Gortash's ring while the city screams.\nWulbren Bongle: I had a plan to put a stop to them.

But we're more than equal to them - there's nothing they can build that the Ironhands can't tear down.\nWulbren Bongle: I've built something unique for just that purpose.\nWulbren Bongle: A runepowder bomb - first of its kind. Fifty wizards high on the Weave couldn't summon this kind of firepower.\nWulbren Bongle: Get the bomb inside the Gondian facility, and - boom. Problem solved.\nBarcus Wroot: Wulbren, please.

What can the Society of Brilliance do for you?\nHavkelaag: Tell me, what can the Society do for you?\nPlayer: I carry an unhatched githyanki egg. Would you be interested in studying it?\nHavkelaag: A githyanki egg? What a fortuitous turn of events. I've been attempting to get my hands on one for some time now.\nHavkelaag: Would you consider parting with it? The Society's coffers are deep enough to cover any expenses accrued in its retrieval, of course. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: Chk. Don't you dare consider it.\nPlayer: What are you going to do with it?\nHavkelaag: Study it, of course. Your kind have been a source of great debate in the Society's circles in recent months.\nHavkelaag: Most on this plane believe you to be innately cruel, violent beings. Evil, if you will.\nHavkelaag: As citizens of the Underdark, we face similar stigmas. Totally unfounded, of course - our natures are as unfixed as any who walk the surface.\nHavkelaag: I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: You're letting your personal biases affect your method. Why assume they're evil?\nHavkelaag: I assume nothing. Innate githyanki cruelty is an established fact - no doubt you witnessed it yourself in the retrieval of the egg itself.\nHavkelaag: When I have a suitable sample for my study, I will, however, prove that the effects of their biological inclination are reversible.\nHavkelaag: Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach:\nHavkelaag: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue.\nHavkelaag: Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: So you're planning to torture a child for a year?\nHavkelaag: The child will be a better individual after my treatment than it ever would have been had it been raised in its natural environment.\nHavkelaag: Any suffering it endures will therefore be worth it, for the child, perhaps for the whole of civilised society.\nHavkelaag: My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: No benefit could justify you inflicting such cruelty.\nHavkelaag: Rigorous experimental methods demand we do not indulge our own emotional responses in the application of discomfort to our subjects.\nHavkelaag: Only by the full, uninhibited application of psionic stimuli will we have a true measure of whether the child's innate evil has been cured.\nHavkelaag: Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg? ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])\nLae'zel: A gith hatchling is not a lab rat!

Curtails it from excess.\nHavkelaag: A cautious, hesitant instinct. One I am afraid we do not have time for.\nHavkelaag: My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: Sounds pointless.

He gives an alarmed look - he knows what’s inside you\nHalsin: Oak Father preserve you, child... You're infected, aren't you? The mind flayers' spawn.\nHalsin: But... something's different. You're aware of the monster inside you. You don't bow to the Absolute, like the True Souls do...\nHalsin: How is this possible...?\nPlayer: I think this artefact has something to do with it.\nHalsin: Hmmm... that looks very alien. As alien as the mind flayers. They do not belong on this world.\nHalsin: You weren't speaking lightly when you said you needed help. Let me tell you what I know.\nHalsin: I've been studying these parasites for a while now. Ever since I discovered these so-called True Souls are infected with them.\nHalsin: Someone is using very powerful magic to modify these tadpoles. They are using them to exert control over the infected.\nHalsin: I'm sorry to say, I can't undo that magic, which means I can't cure you. But that doesn't mean I can't help.\nHalsin: I didn't find what I came here for - a way to remove the tadpoles - but I found the next best thing. I found out where they come from.\nHalsin: That must be where these enchantments are placed on them, and it's where you'll find your cure.\nPlayer: So all of this was for nothing.\nHalsin: Patience. I can't just snap my fingers... but I know where the solution almost certainly lies.\nHalsin: I overheard that the cultists are sending all of their captives to Moonrise Towers.\nHalsin: Innocents go in, True Souls come out. Given that all of these True Souls are infected, it has to be the source of this magic.\nHalsin: If you want to find a cure, you must head there and discover how the tadpoles are being manipulated.\nPlayer: Altered parasites? A cure at Moonrise Towers, maybe? Sounds like guesswork at best.\nHalsin: I'm as certain as I can be. If you have a better alternative, I won't stop you.\nHalsin: I can't stop you, in fact. Which brings me to my next problem...\nHalsin: I've no right to ask more of you... but if you could help me, I'd be free to join your journey to Moonrise.\nHalsin: I cannot allow these butchers to threaten my grove. The natural order must be protected.\nPlayer: All right. How do I help?\nHalsin: My thanks. If you prevail, I'll owe you the debt of a lifetime.\nHalsin: Rare is the beast that survives decapitation. Help me eliminate the drow Minthara, the hobgoblin Dror Ragzlin, and that perversion of a priestess, Gut.\nHalsin: They are the ones holding these parasites together. Remove them and nature will cure itself.\nPlayer: I'll deal with this. You get to safety.\nHalsin: I told you, nowhere is safe. Not while this rot festers. Once it is cut out - once the grove is secure - then I shall leave.\nPlayer: Follow me, then. Your bear form may prove useful.\nHalsin: Be warned - my presence could make things more difficult... I can only restrain my bear form so much. I won't be able to help but attack goblins.\nHalsin: If I join you, we'll likely have to slaughter this entire place.

She swallows, then begins hacking coughing. The moonlight dissipates. She quickly goes from seeming like a divine spirit to a normal young woman.\nIsobel: I didn't realise I had an audience.\nFist Marcus: Isobel. This is -\nIsobel: A Sharran.\nNarrator: *Isobel. The same name as Ketheric Thorm's daughter - the one whose sarcophagus you found empty in the family mausoleum.*\nPlayer: Push your Urges down.\nPlayer: Let's not let an ancient squabble interfere with the task at hand.\nIsobel: Not as ancient as you think.\nIsobel: Frankly, I'm surprised you're willing to help us.

If the Moonmaiden didn't strike me dead for blessing you, she must rather approve of this little alliance.\nIsobel: This will block the lesser effects of the shadow curse, allowing you to traverse the darkness outside... should Shar's own protection falter, that is.\nIsobel: Curious. Surely the Nightsinger could have shielded all her followers, and made this place her domain long ago... yet she only acts now, and aids you alone. I wonder why.\nPlayer: That's none of your concern.\nIsobel: I suppose you're right.\nIsobel: I'll stop needling you, though. You have more important things to do, after all.\nPlayer: I do, though I already have a Moonlantern.\nPlayer: I already have a Moonlantern. I can safely travel the shadows.\nIsobel: Well!

Don't pretend otherwise.\nPlayer: Not all drow are as you say.\nHalsin: Unfair of me, perhaps, but I've had few encounters with drow to make me think otherwise.\nHalsin: Perhaps you can enlighten me.\nPlayer: I'll deal with this.
