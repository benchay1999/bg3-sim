Curious.\nHavkelaag: Tell me, then, philosopher - if patience delays the fostering of the other virtues, can it be rightly called virtuous?\nPlayer: Patience does not delay, it simply tempers virtue. Curtails it from excess.\nHavkelaag: A cautious, hesitant instinct.

Surely the Nightsinger could have shielded all her followers, and made this place her domain long ago... yet she only acts now, and aids you alone. I wonder why.\nPlayer: That's none of your concern.\nIsobel: I suppose you're right.\nIsobel: I'll stop needling you, though.

She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision. The humann clenches its teeth and hisses in pain, but nothing like when the Surgeon applied his scalpel-finger.\nMalus Thorm: Stop. Stay your hand, for it slaps where it should stroke.

See how painfully present you remain...\nMalus Thorm: We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: Their blades are uneven. Efficient surgery will require further training.\nMalus Thorm: Their incisions are, as yet, still streaked with imprecision - that much I must concede.\nMalus Thorm: How to steady their hands, I wonder.\nPlayer: Sparring is vital to progress. Have them practice on each other.\nPlayer: Why not have them hone their skills on each other?\n: True\nMalus Thorm: Yes... For are we not all in need of a cure?\nMalus Thorm: The scalpel does not discriminate. Let each and every one of you partake in its soothing journey.\nMalus Thorm: Absence, sisters. Acquaint yourselves.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) Screaming and slashing, the sisters brutally murder each other.\nMalus Thorm: It is a proud moment when one sees one's teachings so lovingly taken to heart.\nMalus Thorm: You are to be commended for their graduation - rewarded with the promised cure.\nMalus Thorm: Come, I will acquaint you with the Lady's dark-fingered embrace.\nPlayer: I sought purpose in the natural world - I see now that Shar is the only path.
