Curious.\nHavkelaag: Tell me, then, philosopher - if patience delays the fostering of the other virtues, can it be rightly called virtuous?\nPlayer: By your words, any virtue delaying patience would itself be unvirtuous.\nHavkelaag: And therein lies your fault: you would have us argue in circles until the egg hatches naturally.

Very elaborate, incredibly ancient, and entirely diabolical.\nRaphael: If he completes the rite, he will become a new kind of being - the Vampire Ascendant.\nRaphael: All the strengths of his vampiric form will be amplified, and alongside them he will enjoy the luxuries of the living.\nRaphael: The arousals and appetites of man will return to him, and unlike you, he will have no need of a parasite to protect him from the sun.\nRaphael: But the ritual has its price, as all worthwhile things do. Lord Cazador will need to sacrifice a number of souls, including all of his vampiric spawn, if he is to ascend.\nRaphael: Imagine how he felt, then, when one of those precious spawn simply disappeared into thin air.\nRaphael: The only missing ingredient is Astarion.\nRaphael: You are the final piece he requires to complete the ritual - your scars bind you to it.

Very elaborate, incredibly ancient, and entirely diabolical.\nRaphael: If he completes the rite, he will become a new kind of being - the Vampire Ascendant.\nRaphael: All the strengths of his vampiric form will be amplified, and alongside them he will enjoy the luxuries of the living.\nRaphael: The arousals and appetites of man will return to him, and unlike Astarion, he will have no need of a parasite to protect him from the sun.\nRaphael: But the ritual has its price, as all worthwhile things do. Lord Cazador will need to sacrifice a number of souls, including all of his vampiric spawn, if he is to ascend.\nRaphael: Imagine how he felt, then, when one of those precious spawn simply disappeared into thin air.\nRaphael: The only missing ingredient is Astarion.\nRaphael: You are the final piece he requires to complete the ritual - your scars bind you to it.

Regretting it yet?\nWulbren Bongle: I spent a lot of time thinking of worst case scenarios while I was locked in that cell you plucked me out of at Moonrise.\nWulbren Bongle: I didn't imagine anything as bad as this. The Gondians have handed Enver Gortash the means to bring about the end of liberty in Baldur's Gate.\nWulbren Bongle: And the citizens have rolled out the red carpet for their new tyrant.\nWulbren Bongle: Resistance fighters are few and far between - my Ironhands, what's left of the Harpers, and you.

They're a threat to you, me - and every man, woman and child in the city.\nWulbren Bongle: They act all civilised... servants of the people. But they only serve one man.\nWulbren Bongle: When he becomes Grand Duke, it will only get worse. Laws will change, freedoms will vanish, and soon you'll be accused and sentenced before you've even committed a crime.\nWulbren Bongle: And the fucking Gondians are to blame for all of it.\nPlayer: The Gondians are just inventors.

Fifty wizards high on the Weave couldn't summon this kind of firepower.\nWulbren Bongle: Get the bomb inside the Gondian facility, and - boom. Problem solved.\nBarcus Wroot: Wulbren, please.

Let us cure you.\nPlayer: The goddess has greater plans for me than to submit to your scalpels.\n: True\nMalus Thorm: Another absence is your fate?

Many believe us to be 'evil'.\nHavkelaag: The githyanki face similar prejudice, but I believe, if hatched in a less violent, more intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome its evil predispositions.\nHavkelaag: I believe that, if hatched in a morally sound, intellectually stimulating environment, the child can overcome the evil predisposition its githyanki nature bestows.\nPlayer: You're letting your personal biases affect your method. Why assume they're evil?\nHavkelaag: I assume nothing.

You're after a cure for this parasite.\nHalsin: I've been studying these parasites for a while now.

Afterwards, I was able to study the parasite that slithered out of the corpse, see what drives these 'True Souls'.\nHalsin: I had no idea anyone beyond their ranks was infected. You have my sincere sympathies.\nPlayer: This magic you mentioned - it isn't normal for these parasites?\nPlayer: Then everything we did here was hopeless.\nHalsin: Patience. I can't just snap my fingers... but I know where the solution almost certainly lies.\nHalsin: I overheard that the cultists are sending all of their captives to Moonrise Towers.\nHalsin: Innocents go in, True Souls come out. Given that all of these True Souls are infected, it has to be the source of this magic.\nHalsin: If you want to find a cure, you must head there and discover how the tadpoles are being manipulated.\nPlayer: At least I know what to do now. Thank you.\nHalsin: Wait - I could help you find a cure... but I need to settle matters here first.\nHalsin: I've no right to ask more of you... but if you could help me, I'd be free to join your journey to Moonrise.\nHalsin: I cannot allow these butchers to threaten my grove.

But this is too much - this is unnatural.\nHalsin: It's too late to merely kill this horde's leadership - their forces are already marching.

Very elaborate, incredibly ancient, and entirely diabolical.\nRaphael: If he completes the rite, he will become a new kind of being - the Vampire Ascendant.\nRaphael: All the strengths of his vampiric form will be amplified, and alongside them he will enjoy the luxuries of the living.\nRaphael: The arousals and appetites of man will return to him, and unlike Astarion, he will have no need of a parasite to protect him from the sun.\nRaphael: But the ritual has its price, as all worthwhile things do.

Now I want what I'm owed - we had a deal.\nRaphael: Indeed we did. I discovered all there is to know about those scars of yours - it's a rather grim tale, even for my tastes.\nPlayer: We had a deal - the orthon for information.\nRaphael: Indeed we did. I discovered all there is to know about those scars of yours - it's a rather grim tale, even for my tastes.\nPlayer: Spill it - this sounds fascinating.\nAstarion: I'd appreciate a little less enthusiasm when it comes to Cazador and his horrors.\nRaphael: Oh come, Astarion. We're about to unveil your destiny - you should be quivering in anticipation.\nRaphael: As you know already, your precious skin is home to one part of a contract between the archdevil Mephistopheles, and your former master, Cazador Szarr.\nRaphael: In full, the contract states that Cazador will be granted knowledge of an infernal ritual so vile it has never been performed.\nRaphael: The Rite of Profane Ascension.\nRaphael: It promises to be a marvellous ceremony. Very elaborate, incredibly ancient, and entirely diabolical.\nRaphael: If he completes the rite, he will become a new kind of being - the Vampire Ascendant.\nRaphael: All the strengths of his vampiric form will be amplified, and alongside them he will enjoy the luxuries of the living.\nRaphael: The arousals and appetites of man will return to him, and unlike you, he will have no need of a parasite to protect him from the sun.\nRaphael: But the ritual has its price, as all worthwhile things do. Lord Cazador will need to sacrifice a number of souls, including all of his vampiric spawn, if he is to ascend.\nRaphael: Imagine how he felt, then, when one of those precious spawn simply disappeared into thin air.\nRaphael: The only missing ingredient is Astarion.\nRaphael: You are the final piece he requires to complete the ritual - your scars bind you to it. Your soul will set off a very wave of death, bringing Cazador his twisted life.\nRaphael: And that, my tragic and toothsome friend, is that. Now if you'll excuse me, I have business elsewhere.\nNodeContext: [Tarik] snaps fingers at the end of the line.\nAstarion: Hmm...\nPlayer: Cazador is a piece of shit. We're going to stop him.\nAstarion: Do you think it's so simple?\nAstarion: What do you think I should do?\nPlayer: I think you should run.
