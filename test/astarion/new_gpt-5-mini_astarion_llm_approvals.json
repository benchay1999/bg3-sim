Now I want what I'm owed - we had a deal.\nRaphael: Indeed we did.

Maybe it's best left in the past.\nAstarion: Even if I wanted to walk away from all of this, I can't. Cazador won't let me.\nRaphael: And why would he want to walk away? This is his destiny.\nRaphael: As you know already, your precious skin is home to one part of a contract between the archdevil Mephistopheles, and your former master, Cazador Szarr.\nRaphael: In full, the contract states that Cazador will be granted knowledge of an infernal ritual so vile it has never been performed.\nRaphael: The Rite of Profane Ascension.\nRaphael: It promises to be a marvellous ceremony. Very elaborate, incredibly ancient, and entirely diabolical.\nRaphael: If he completes the rite, he will become a new kind of being - the Vampire Ascendant.\nRaphael: All the strengths of his vampiric form will be amplified, and alongside them he will enjoy the luxuries of the living.\nRaphael: The arousals and appetites of man will return to him, and unlike Astarion, he will have no need of a parasite to protect him from the sun.\nRaphael: But the ritual has its price, as all worthwhile things do. Lord Cazador will need to sacrifice a number of souls, including all of his vampiric spawn, if he is to ascend.\nRaphael: Imagine how he felt, then, when one of those precious spawn simply disappeared into thin air.\nRaphael: The only missing ingredient is Astarion.\nRaphael: You are the final piece he requires to complete the ritual - your scars bind you to it.

Very elaborate, incredibly ancient, and entirely diabolical.\nRaphael: If he completes the rite, he will become a new kind of being - the Vampire Ascendant.\nRaphael: All the strengths of his vampiric form will be amplified, and alongside them he will enjoy the luxuries of the living.\nRaphael: The arousals and appetites of man will return to him, and unlike Astarion, he will have no need of a parasite to protect him from the sun.\nRaphael: But the ritual has its price, as all worthwhile things do.

Very elaborate, incredibly ancient, and entirely diabolical.\nRaphael: If he completes the rite, he will become a new kind of being - the Vampire Ascendant.\nRaphael: All the strengths of his vampiric form will be amplified, and alongside them he will enjoy the luxuries of the living.\nRaphael: The arousals and appetites of man will return to him, and unlike Astarion, he will have no need of a parasite to protect him from the sun.\nRaphael: But the ritual has its price, as all worthwhile things do. Lord Cazador will need to sacrifice a number of souls, including all of his vampiric spawn, if he is to ascend.\nRaphael: Imagine how he felt, then, when one of those precious spawn simply disappeared into thin air.\nRaphael: The only missing ingredient is Astarion.\nRaphael: You are the final piece he requires to complete the ritual - your scars bind you to it.

Very elaborate, incredibly ancient, and entirely diabolical.\nRaphael: If he completes the rite, he will become a new kind of being - the Vampire Ascendant.\nRaphael: All the strengths of his vampiric form will be amplified, and alongside them he will enjoy the luxuries of the living.\nRaphael: The arousals and appetites of man will return to him, and unlike Astarion, he will have no need of a parasite to protect him from the sun.\nRaphael: But the ritual has its price, as all worthwhile things do. Lord Cazador will need to sacrifice a number of souls, including all of his vampiric spawn, if he is to ascend.\nRaphael: Imagine how he felt, then, when one of those precious spawn simply disappeared into thin air.\nRaphael: The only missing ingredient is Astarion.\nRaphael: You are the final piece he requires to complete the ritual - your scars bind you to it.

Very elaborate, incredibly ancient, and entirely diabolical.\nRaphael: If he completes the rite, he will become a new kind of being - the Vampire Ascendant.\nRaphael: All the strengths of his vampiric form will be amplified, and alongside them he will enjoy the luxuries of the living.\nRaphael: The arousals and appetites of man will return to him, and unlike Astarion, he will have no need of a parasite to protect him from the sun.\nRaphael: But the ritual has its price, as all worthwhile things do. Lord Cazador will need to sacrifice a number of souls, including all of his vampiric spawn, if he is to ascend.\nRaphael: Imagine how he felt, then, when one of those precious spawn simply disappeared into thin air.\nRaphael: The only missing ingredient is Astarion.\nRaphael: You are the final piece he requires to complete the ritual - your scars bind you to it. Your soul will set off a very wave of death, bringing Cazador his twisted life.\nRaphael: And that, my tragic and toothsome friend, is that.

I worshipped that woman.\nPlayer: An old flame?\nNightwarden Minthara: Jealous? You needn't be -  when Orin is in my hands, her agony will nourish me.\nNightwarden Minthara: She is the iblith who indoctrinated me with the Absolute's lies.\nNightwarden Minthara: Indeed, she is the one who indoctrinated me with the Absolute's lies.\nPlayer: What do you remember of your indoctrination?\nNightwarden Minthara: When I first visited Moonrise, I stood before the Absolute in awe.\nNightwarden Minthara: It was more of an idea than an entity. Pure love. Total power.\nNightwarden Minthara: Orin was by my side. She told me that god had chosen me to be a True Soul. Blessed and adored.\nNightwarden Minthara: Now I know that those memories are lies.\nNightwarden Minthara: There was no god. Orin held me down in a cocoon of flesh, while a mind flayer forced a parasite into my brain. And she laughed at my fear.\nNightwarden Minthara: I will find her, I will murder her. And I will smile.\nPlayer: We'll be heroes - the saviours of Baldur's Gate.\nNightwarden Minthara: Let them think that. There is a short path from saviour to ruler - a short and bloody path. I know it well, and we will walk it together.\nNightwarden Minthara: But Baldur's Gate is a mere bauble. We have the chance to seize something much greater. Surely you see it?\nNightwarden Minthara: In killing Ketheric, we fractured the cult's leadership. When we break the other Chosen and claim their Netherstones, we can take control.\nPlayer: A bold gamble. How can you be sure it's possible?\nNightwarden Minthara: I would have thought this entire conspiracy of gods and monsters to be impossible if I had not seen it for myself.\nNightwarden Minthara: We may fail, but we must try.\nNightwarden Minthara: The power of the enslaved elder brain could reshape the world.
