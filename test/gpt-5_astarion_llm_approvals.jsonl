I never expected this.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: I'll tell you what I know.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: A century ago, there was a man - Sarevok Anchev. He was a child of the god of murder, Bhaal.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: He ruled the Iron Throne - a dark tower hiding a darker secret. It was the front for a deadly arms-dealing network.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: There, Sarevok amassed an army and sought to become a god. Under his stewardship, the Bhaal Temple was revived, and with it, the Bhaal cult itself.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: Fortunately, the Temple was destroyed, and to cleanse the city of Sarevok's memory, the Iron Throne was torn from its foundations and cast into the Chionthar.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: For most, that was the end of it.

But there's something more here, something new...\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: There's a reverence to these murders, a certain flair.
