A display of the well-known githyanki arrogance. I am not sure my experiment can cure that particular affliction, but give me time and I will find a way.\nHavkelaag: Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg?

Curious.\nHavkelaag: Tell me, then, philosopher - if patience delays the fostering of the other virtues, can it be rightly called virtuous?\nPlayer: By your words, any virtue delaying patience would itself be unvirtuous.\nHavkelaag: And therein lies your fault: you would have us argue in circles until the egg hatches naturally.

Several Darkcloak sisters stand by, each with a scalpel in hand. The surgeon’s voice is very gentle - the voice of a father explaining something to his young child.\nMalus Thorm: The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar.\nMalus Thorm: See how the patient reacts when I but stroke the right nerve. Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy.\nMalus Thorm: Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself. She cuts into the human’s belly, but it’s a superficial and hesitant incision.

We can hardly hear the patient's sighs of solace.\nMalus Thorm: Perhaps it is our unexpected audience that makes you quiver.\nMalus Thorm: Come. Step forward. You are no sister, but that matters none. Every student is welcome.\nPlayer: What wrong has this man done to deserve such torture?\nMalus Thorm: Behold, sisters, the very face of ignorance - one who mistakes tenderness for torture.\nMalus Thorm: Go on. Acquaint the face of ignorance with the true object of our studies.\nSister Hunna: Absence.\nMalus Thorm: Absence. No other word captures the heart of Shar so very perfectly.\nMalus Thorm: It is the scalpel-led journey that leads from pain to peace.\nShadowheart: A stinging truth - but a truth nonetheless.\nMalus Thorm: See? What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being?\nMalus Thorm: If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: But you: look how the succour of Shar eludes you. See how painfully present you remain...\nMalus Thorm: We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: Your subject is tainted. Shar's succour must only be granted to the willing.\nMalus Thorm: Hmmm. 'Only the willing may know the Lady's embrace.'

Kagha - their new First Druid - won't even see me.\nZevlor: You, though... I know it's not your business, but she owes you for saving this place.\nZevlor: Perhaps you could persuade her.
