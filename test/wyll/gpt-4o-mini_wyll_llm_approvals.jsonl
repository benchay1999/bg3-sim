Her hands are in a prayer position and she's chanting softly as the moonlight dances around her. She exhales, then inhales and breaths in tendrils of shadow, absorbing them. She swallows, then begins hacking coughing. The moonlight dissipates. She quickly goes from seeming like a divine spirit to a normal young woman.\nIsobel: I didn't realise I had an audience.\nFist Marcus: Isobel. This is -\nIsobel: A Sharran.\nNarrator: *Isobel. The same name as Ketheric Thorm's daughter - the one whose sarcophagus you found empty in the family mausoleum.*\nPlayer: Push your Urges down.\nPlayer: This Sharran exposed a traitor in your midst.\nIsobel: Fair. I admit, Marcus waltzing around the place undetected bodes rather ill for our defences, doesn't it?\nIsobel: Then again, the best defence is a good offence.\nIsobel: Frankly, I'm surprised you're willing to help us.

If the Moonmaiden didn't strike me dead for blessing you, she must rather approve of this little alliance.\nIsobel: This will block the lesser effects of the shadow curse, allowing you to traverse the darkness outside... should Shar's own protection falter, that is.\nIsobel: Curious. Surely the Nightsinger could have shielded all her followers, and made this place her domain long ago... yet she only acts now, and aids you alone. I wonder why.\nPlayer: That's none of your concern.\nIsobel: I suppose you're right.\nIsobel: I'll stop needling you, though.

Then I will help you.\n\nHalsin: Three deaths could win us peace: the drow Minthara, the hobgoblin Dror Ragzlin, and that perversion of a priestess, Gut.\nHalsin: They are the ones holding these parasites together. Remove them and nature will cure itself.\nPlayer: You are aware you're asking me to kill a drow?\nHalsin: You drow relish turning on your own, if there's something to be gained.

Curious.\nHavkelaag: Tell me, then, philosopher - if patience delays the fostering of the other virtues, can it be rightly called virtuous?\nPlayer: By your words, any virtue delaying patience would itself be unvirtuous.\nHavkelaag: And therein lies your fault: you would have us argue in circles until the egg hatches naturally. Time we do not have.\nHavkelaag: My findings could change the perception of githyanki and the peoples of the Underdark for generations to come.\nPlayer: Your findings are irrelevant, as are the opinions of all on this kaincha plane.\nHavkelaag: Ah.

Hear its comfort. Hear the very melody of mercy.\nMalus Thorm: Pray, sister, show us the extent of your beneficence.\n[description] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) The Darkcloak sister approaches - she looks uncertain of herself.

What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being?\nMalus Thorm: If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure, for in light there is presence, but in darkness there is absence.\nSister Hunna: In light is presence; in darkness, absence.\nMalus Thorm: You are well on your way. But one white orb disfigures you still. Let us finish the cure.\nMalus Thorm: We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.\nPlayer: Your subject is tainted. Shar's succour must only be granted to the willing.\nMalus Thorm: Hmmm. 'Only the willing may know the Lady's embrace.'
