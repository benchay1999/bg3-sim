I knew my conclusions were sound, but this... I never expected this.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: I'll tell you what I know.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: A century ago, there was a man - Sarevok Anchev. He was a child of the god of murder, Bhaal.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: He ruled the Iron Throne - a dark tower hiding a darker secret. It was the front for a deadly arms-dealing network.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: There, Sarevok amassed an army and sought to become a god. Under his stewardship, the Bhaal Temple was revived, and with it, the Bhaal cult itself.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: Fortunately, the Temple was destroyed, and to cleanse the city of Sarevok's memory, the Iron Throne was torn from its foundations and cast into the Chionthar.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: For most, that was the end of it. But cults like that don't disappear overnight. This list you brought me confirms I'm right.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: The Bhaal cult is back, and someone is out there, continuing Sarevok's work.\nPlayer: I think it may be another Bhaalspawn...\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: Gods save us all if you're right, but I'd believe it. Whoever it is, they are intimately familiar with Sarevok's work.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: The brutality of the killings is on a par with Sarevok's own. But there's something more here, something new...\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: There's a reverence to these murders, a certain flair. It's as if they were done in worship.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: The precision of the cuts, the depth, the execution - the best butchers in Faerûn couldn't make a cut like that. Trust me, I've asked them.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: I've done everything I can within the remit of my job. Any more, and they'll fire me.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: But you - you're not bound by such constraints. Help me out, here.

He was a child of the god of murder, Bhaal.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: He ruled the Iron Throne - a dark tower hiding a darker secret. It was the front for a deadly arms-dealing network.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: There, Sarevok amassed an army and sought to become a god. Under his stewardship, the Bhaal Temple was revived, and with it, the Bhaal cult itself.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: Fortunately, the Temple was destroyed, and to cleanse the city of Sarevok's memory, the Iron Throne was torn from its foundations and cast into the Chionthar.\nGauntlet Devella Fountainhead: For most, that was the end of it.

Blessed and adored.\nNightwarden Minthara: Now I know that those memories are lies.\nNightwarden Minthara: There was no god. Orin held me down in a cocoon of flesh, while a mind flayer forced a parasite into my brain. And she laughed at my fear.\nNightwarden Minthara: I will find her, I will murder her.
