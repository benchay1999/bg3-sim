Let me tell you what I know.\nHalsin: I've been studying these parasites for a while now. Ever since I discovered these so-called True Souls are infected with them.\nHalsin: Someone is using very powerful magic to modify these tadpoles. They are using them to exert control over the infected.\nHalsin: I'm sorry to say, I can't undo that magic, which means I can't cure you. But that doesn't mean I can't help.\nHalsin: I didn't find what I came here for - a way to remove the tadpoles - but I found the next best thing. I found out where they come from.\nHalsin: That must be where these enchantments are placed on them, and it's where you'll find your cure.\nPlayer: You learned all this from your studies?\nHalsin: Indeed. After we dealt with the drow that ambushed us, Nettie and I were able to inspect the corpse - and the creature that slithered out of it.\nHalsin: I had no idea anyone beyond their ranks was infected. You have my sincere sympathies.\nPlayer: This magic you mentioned - it isn't normal for these parasites?\nPlayer: What should I do?\nHalsin: I overheard that the cultists are sending all of their captives to Moonrise Towers.\nHalsin: Innocents go in, True Souls come out. Given that all of these True Souls are infected, it has to be the source of this magic.\nHalsin: If you want to find a cure, you must head there and discover how the tadpoles are being manipulated.\nPlayer: At least I know what to do now. Thank you.\nHalsin: Wait - I could help you find a cure... but I need to settle matters here first.\nHalsin: I've no right to ask more of you... but if you could help me, I'd be free to join your journey to Moonrise.\nHalsin: I cannot allow these butchers to threaten my grove. The natural order must be protected.\nPlayer: Kagha was swayed by Shadow Druids. She nearly sealed the grove.\nHalsin: Kagha... I should have suspected she'd take things too far. I'll deal with her when I can.\nHalsin: But there are other matters to attend to before that.\nHalsin: Chaos is welcome, in doses; it helps keep balance. But this is too much - this is unnatural.\nHalsin: It's too late to merely kill this horde's leadership - their forces are already marching. If you want me to help, you need to help me first.\nHalsin: You must get ahead of them, muster the defences.\nPlayer: Very well.

Elturel had no place for tieflings after the Descent.\n: False\nPlayer: 'The Descent'? What is that?\nZevlor: I'm surprised you haven't heard of it.\nZevlor: The High Overseer - our grand protector - signed a pact with devils. It dragged Elturel straight to Hell.\nZevlor: Lucky for us, a group of adventurers found a way to bring the city back.\nZevlor: Afterwards, people looked at us and just saw 'devilkin'. No different from the druids here, really.\nZevlor: We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters.\nPlayer: This ritual - is there no way to convince the druids to stop it?\nZevlor: I've tried.

Wasn't sure you'd make it to the city. Regretting it yet?\nWulbren Bongle: I spent a lot of time thinking of worst case scenarios while I was locked in that cell you plucked me out of at Moonrise.\nWulbren Bongle: I didn't imagine anything as bad as this. The Gondians have handed Enver Gortash the means to bring about the end of liberty in Baldur's Gate.\nWulbren Bongle: And the citizens have rolled out the red carpet for their new tyrant.\nWulbren Bongle: Resistance fighters are few and far between - my Ironhands, what's left of the Harpers, and you. I hope.\nPlayer: I'm with you.\nWulbren Bongle: Good. We don't have a chance unless we stick together - not while the Gondians' metal monsters are patrolling the streets.\nWulbren Bongle: The Steel Watch. They're a threat to you, me - and every man, woman and child in the city.\nWulbren Bongle: They act all civilised... servants of the people. But they only serve one man.\nWulbren Bongle: When he becomes Grand Duke, it will only get worse. Laws will change, freedoms will vanish, and soon you'll be accused and sentenced before you've even committed a crime.\nWulbren Bongle: And the fucking Gondians are to blame for all of it.\nPlayer: Cheer up Wulbren. We're here to help.\nWulbren Bongle: I heard about that. You had the Harpers all excited, but there aren't many Harpers left.\nWulbren Bongle: These Steel Watchers. One of them is the equivalent of a red dragon. An army of them, well... there's never been an army of dragons.\nPlayer: I'm not scared of dragons. Or Steel Watchers.\nWulbren Bongle: There's a line where bravery becomes stupidity. You just crossed it.\nWulbren Bongle: Scared or not, you can't take down every Steel Watcher in the city. Unless you hit the people who build them - the Gondians.\nWulbren Bongle: They've always been happy to provide their technology to despots in exchange for a stipend and the freedom to work in peace.\nWulbren Bongle: They would have licked Sarevok's boots given the chance, and now they'll kiss Gortash's ring while the city screams.\nWulbren Bongle: I had a plan to put a stop to them. But the way things are now, if we stick our heads above ground, the Watchers are on us like flies on shit.\nPlayer: No plan survives contact with the enemy - unless I'm involved.\nWulbren Bongle: Exactly. You freed us from Ketheric's rotten cells - I reckon you can rid us of these Gondians just as easily.\nWulbren Bongle: You just need a little assistance, and I can provide it.\nWulbren Bongle: The Gondians are ingenious. But we're more than equal to them - there's nothing they can build that the Ironhands can't tear down.\nWulbren Bongle: I've built something unique for just that purpose.\nWulbren Bongle: A runepowder bomb - first of its kind. Fifty wizards high on the Weave couldn't summon this kind of firepower.\nWulbren Bongle: Get the bomb inside the Gondian facility, and - boom. Problem solved.\nBarcus Wroot: Wulbren, please. This is too far! Everyone in the foundry would be killed.\nWulbren Bongle: Quiet, Barcus. The adults are talking.\nPlayer: Those metal monsters spit in nature's face, but mass murder is a bit far.\nWulbren Bongle: It's liberation.\nWulbren Bongle: The Gondians picked their side the minute they took orders from Gortash.\nWulbren Bongle: If they had any courage, they'd have refused him and died like heroes, spitting in his face.\nWulbren Bongle: Now they'll die like the dogs they are.\nPlayer: I'll make contact with the Gondians - maybe they'll see reason.\nBarcus Wroot: That's what I've been saying! There may yet be a peaceful solution.\nWulbren Bongle: Fine. You want to try flapping your gums in the belly of the beast, be my guest.\nWulbren Bongle: But their idea of diplomacy is a steel fist shoved where the sun don't shine.\nWulbren Bongle: So take the bomb. Just in case I'm right, and you're wrong.\nPlayer: Keep your bomb.

Ever since I discovered these so-called True Souls are infected with them.\nHalsin: Someone is using very powerful magic to modify these tadpoles.

I found out where they come from.\nHalsin: That must be where these enchantments are placed on them, and it's where you'll find your cure.\nPlayer: How did you come to study mind flayer parasites?\nHalsin: A drow forced me to defend myself. Afterwards, I was able to study the parasite that slithered out of the corpse, see what drives these 'True Souls'.\nHalsin: I had no idea anyone beyond their ranks was infected. You have my sincere sympathies.\nPlayer: Sympathies won't help me to survive.\nHalsin: Patience. I can't just snap my fingers... but I know where the solution almost certainly lies.\nHalsin: I overheard that the cultists are sending all of their captives to Moonrise Towers.\nHalsin: Innocents go in, True Souls come out. Given that all of these True Souls are infected, it has to be the source of this magic.\nHalsin: If you want to find a cure, you must head there and discover how the tadpoles are being manipulated.\nPlayer: Altered parasites? A cure at Moonrise Towers, maybe? Sounds like guesswork at best.\nHalsin: I'm as certain as I can be. If you have a better alternative, I won't stop you.\nHalsin: I can't stop you, in fact. Which brings me to my next problem...\nHalsin: I've no right to ask more of you... but if you could help me, I'd be free to join your journey to Moonrise.\nHalsin: I cannot allow these butchers to threaten my grove.

But this is too much - this is unnatural.\nHalsin: It's too late to merely kill this horde's leadership - their forces are already marching.

Very elaborate, incredibly ancient, and entirely diabolical.\nRaphael: If he completes the rite, he will become a new kind of being - the Vampire Ascendant.\nRaphael: All the strengths of his vampiric form will be amplified, and alongside them he will enjoy the luxuries of the living.\nRaphael: The arousals and appetites of man will return to him, and unlike Astarion, he will have no need of a parasite to protect him from the sun.\nRaphael: But the ritual has its price, as all worthwhile things do.

This is too far! Everyone in the foundry would be killed.\nWulbren Bongle: Quiet, Barcus.

Why assume they're evil?\nHavkelaag: I assume nothing. Innate githyanki cruelty is an established fact - no doubt you witnessed it yourself in the retrieval of the egg itself.\nHavkelaag: When I have a suitable sample for my study, I will, however, prove that the effects of their biological inclination are reversible.\nHavkelaag: Once out of the shell, I plan to take a twofold approach:\nHavkelaag: The enforced repetition of sound moral principles from the Ptarian code, alongside a series of psionic pulses administered to the cerebral tissue.\nHavkelaag: Assuming I can accelerate its growth, I should have conclusive findings within a year or two at the most.\nPlayer: This experiment is exactly the kind of evil you're trying to disprove.\nHavkelaag: The pursuit of knowledge is neither evil nor good.

A display of the well-known githyanki arrogance. I am not sure my experiment can cure that particular affliction, but give me time and I will find a way.\nHavkelaag: Now, I'm eager to get started, so will you sell me the egg?

After we dealt with the drow that ambushed us, Nettie and I were able to inspect the corpse - and the creature that slithered out of it.\nHalsin: I had no idea anyone beyond their ranks was infected. You have my sincere sympathies.\nPlayer: Sympathies won't help me to survive.\nHalsin: Patience. I can't just snap my fingers... but I know where the solution almost certainly lies.\nHalsin: I overheard that the cultists are sending all of their captives to Moonrise Towers.\nHalsin: Innocents go in, True Souls come out. Given that all of these True Souls are infected, it has to be the source of this magic.\nHalsin: If you want to find a cure, you must head there and discover how the tadpoles are being manipulated.\nPlayer: Altered parasites? A cure at Moonrise Towers, maybe? Sounds like guesswork at best.\nHalsin: I'm as certain as I can be. If you have a better alternative, I won't stop you.\nHalsin: I can't stop you, in fact. Which brings me to my next problem...\nHalsin: I've no right to ask more of you... but if you could help me, I'd be free to join your journey to Moonrise.\nHalsin: I cannot allow these butchers to threaten my grove. The natural order must be protected.\nPlayer: Look around you - there's no order anymore. Only chaos.\nHalsin: Chaos is welcome, in doses; it helps keep balance. But this is too much - this is unnatural.\nHalsin: It's too late to merely kill this horde's leadership - their forces are already marching. If you want me to help, you need to help me first.\nHalsin: You must get ahead of them, muster the defences.\nPlayer: Very well.

The restoration of the Illithid Empire, which spanned the entirety of the multiverse.\nCh'r'ai W'wargaz: For centuries, their elder brains sought to bring back their dominion. Every plot they hatched, we stopped. But now, they are close to succeeding.\nCh'r'ai W'wargaz: Never before could they pause ceremorphosis. Never before could they let the infection spread undetected.\nCh'r'ai W'wargaz: Imagine that everywhere.

Please.\nGROUP_Daisy: Don't give it to him.\nPlayer: I won't let you take it.\nLae'zel: Do not try me. Hand over the artefact, or die by my hand.\nNodeContext: Threatening and confident.

Now.\nPlayer: No. This is the point where I stop asking, and start cutting.\n: True\nRugan: Fine - no need for more violence. I'll tell my associates everything was lost in the ambush.\n\nRugan: And no hard feelings, y'hear? I'd have done the same if I were you. Business at the end of a blade is still business.\nRugan: Crafty swine like you could make a name for yourself in the Zhentarim. Make sure to drop by our hideout.\nRugan: Pass phrase at the door is 'little serpent, long shadow'. I'll tell my associates to expect you.\nPlayer: I already met your friends - we didn't get along too well.\nRugan: And yet here you are. There's not many cause trouble in a Zhent hideout and walk away.\nRugan: I'd rather walk away too. So let's say our goodbyes, and speak no more of it.\nPlayer: Cargo's mine now.
