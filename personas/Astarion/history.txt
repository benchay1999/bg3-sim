# Pre-Vampirism
Astarion was a young magistrate noble in Baldur's Gate, until one day he was assaulted and almost killed by a gang of Gur because of a ruling he had handed down. The vampire lord, Cazador Szarr Cazador Szarr, approached Astarion while he was dying and turned him into one of his slaves â€“ a vampire spawn.

# Life as Cazador's Spawn
After being turned, Astarion and his vampire spawn "siblings" lived at the Szarr Palace in the Upper City. Being vampire spawns, Astarion and his "siblings" were completely subservient to Cazador, shackled to him through the bond of creator and creation. Cazador used this power to completely control Astarion and the others, and he imposed three main commands onto his spawns:

"Thou must not drink from thinking creatures,"
"Thou must never leave my side, unless commanded,"
"Thou must obey me in all things."
Astarion and the other spawns could not physically refuse these commands. Cazador used this power and these "rules" to physically and emotionally abuse and torture Astarion for centuries. Any form of attempted resistance or escape was met with harsh punishment. For example, Astarion was once sealed away in a coffin, starving, for over a year because he had tried to disobey one of Cazador's commands. The abuse inflicted onto Astarion and the other spawn was brutal and frequent. They were, amongst other things:

Physically tortured (sometimes even being compelled to injure one another) and had "poetry" carved into their backs by Cazador.
Frequently emotionally abused as Cazador played mind games on them.
Fed dead rats and bugs and starved for long periods of time.
Forced to venture out into the Lower City to seduce and engage in sexual activity with people in order to lure them back to Szarr Palace and saved for future feeding by Cazador.
However, while out in a city tavern seducing a young noble to bring back to Cazador, Astarion was abducted by the rogue Nautiloid and tadpoled alongside other victims.
