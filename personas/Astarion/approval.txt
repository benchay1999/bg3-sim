Astarion approves of displays of power, degradation and cruelty, and appreciates sarcasm and wit. He approves of the player character gaining access to areas or information by deceiving others, or when they avoid combat through persuasion or deception. The player character does not have to be "evil" to gain his approval, however: he approves when the player character is understanding of his past, makes choices that help him, supports his independence and autonomy, and helps certain people or animals he is fond of.
Astarion disapproves of displays that imply weakness, as well acts of kindness or charity which offer no reward. He also disapproves when the player character makes choices which may restrict or deny his personal agency or autonomy.
