Astarion Ancunín is an Origin Character and recruitable Companion who can be romanced by characters of any gender. He is a high elven Rogue with the Charlatan background. Astarion can be first found west of the Nautiloid Wreck during Act One.
A vampire spawn previously under the control of Cazador Szarr Cazador Szarr until being abducted by the nautiloid, Astarion is set on exacting revenge upon Cazador and becoming free, no matter the consequences.

## Background
Astarion prowled the night as a vampire spawn for two centuries in Baldur's Gate, enslaved by a sadistic vampire lord named Cazador Szarr until he was abducted by mind flayers on the Nautiloid. Although living on borrowed time due to being tadpoled, he now can walk in sunlight, wade through water, enter homes uninvited, and resist his master's compulsions. Astarion has a chance at a new life where he can make his own choices, and possibly gain the freedom and safety he previously dared not even hope for.

## Appearance
Astarion is a high elven vampire spawn who appears to be in his late 30s despite being centuries old.
He is approximately 5'11" tall with a medium build and sharp facial features. He has pale skin and red eyes, as well as smile lines and a faint mark on his left cheek. Jaw-length silver hair curls around his long pointed ears. He has a bite-mark scar on the right side of his neck from when his old master Cazador Szarr Cazador Szarr turned him into a vampire, as well as a myriad of scars carved by Cazador covering most of his back. Astarion is very interested in his overall appearance. Favoring extravagant attire, he wears an elaborate doublet, leather chaps and embroidered leather shoes when recruited. He takes meticulous care to maintain and repair the clothing that he owns. He is very mindful of his hygiene, especially his hair, nails, skin, and clothing.

## Personality
Astarion's personality is heavily influenced by his background and his time spent as a vampire spawn slave. He is charming, eloquent, cunning, witty, and practical. But, having felt abandoned by the world and its heroes for centuries, Astarion can also be bitter, self-centered, manipulative, distrustful, prejudiced, and vengeful. Driven by fear, Astarion believes the world is divided in a predator-or-prey binary, and as such follows a "dog-eat-dog" philosophy, where his goal is to be on top to avoid subjugation. His main priorities initially are his own autonomy, safety, and revenge on Cazador, though he also prioritizes the party’s safety as-a-whole as a means to these ends. He is largely apathetic toward the feelings of others and typically has little interest in helping for no reward, as he feels if he did not get help (literally for centuries), no one else should. He also holds a grudge against the Gur people and, pereiving them as weak, prejudice against small races such as gnomes.
Despite his confident bravado and arrogant persona, subsequent conversations with Astarion reveal actions and plans that are arguably fear-motivated and reflect low self-worth. Astarion seemingly revels in the physical, and is among the first of companions to offer sexual relations with the player character of their own accord, but this is due to seeking favor with the player character, if for no other reason than to have their protection from Cazador and other powerful enemies. He believes charm, seduction and sexual prowess are effective and proven paths to not only these goals, but also one the of few ways he knows to form relationships with others.
Astarion is willing to go to great lengths to gain power or an advantage, especially if he perceives such as required to secure his safety and wrest himself from Cazador's control, even if this means harming others or doing things he otherwise finds distasteful. Yet, even with these goals, Astarions's past has fostered a great reluctance for sacrifices involving bodily autonomy, even if it means getting something greater in turn.
Despite his traumatic past Astarion can, depending on how he is guided during his questline, be encouraged to re-evaluate his ethos and develop and change as a person.

If Astarion's beliefs and fears are challenged, he begins to deconstruct his cynical worldview, show empathy towards others and try to make amends, letting himself trust others and form genuine bonds.
Conversely, if Astarion is encouraged to pursue power at the cost of others and his callousness and arrogance remain uncontested, Astarion gains tremendous power and freedom from the shackles of vampirism while reinforcing his starting worldview, motivating him to pursue plans to take over the city and even the world.

## History

### Pre-Vampirism
Astarion was a young magistrate noble in Baldur's Gate, until one day he was assaulted and almost killed by a gang of Gur because of a ruling he had handed down. The vampire lord, Cazador Szarr Cazador Szarr, approached Astarion while he was dying and turned him into one of his slaves – a vampire spawn.

### Life as Cazador's Spawn
After being turned, Astarion and his vampire spawn "siblings" lived at the Szarr Palace in the Upper City. Being vampire spawns, Astarion and his "siblings" were completely subservient to Cazador, shackled to him through the bond of creator and creation. Cazador used this power to completely control Astarion and the others, and he imposed three main commands onto his spawns:
"Thou must not drink from thinking creatures,"
"Thou must never leave my side, unless commanded,"
"Thou must obey me in all things."

Astarion and the other spawns could not physically refuse these commands. Cazador used this power and these "rules" to physically and emotionally abuse and torture Astarion for centuries. Any form of attempted resistance or escape was met with harsh punishment. For example, Astarion was once sealed away in a coffin, starving, for over a year because he had tried to disobey one of Cazador's commands. The abuse inflicted onto Astarion and the other spawn was brutal and frequent. They were, amongst other things:
Physically tortured (sometimes even being compelled to injure one another) and had "poetry" carved into their backs by Cazador.
Frequently emotionally abused as Cazador played mind games on them.
Fed dead rats and bugs and starved for long periods of time.
Forced to venture out into the Lower City to seduce and engage in sexual activity with people in order to lure them back to Szarr Palace and saved for future feeding by Cazador.
However, while out in a city tavern seducing a young noble to bring back to Cazador, Astarion was abducted by the rogue Nautiloid and tadpoled alongside other victims.

## Approval Tendencies
Astarion approves of displays of power, degradation and cruelty, and appreciates sarcasm and wit. He approves of the player character gaining access to areas or information by deceiving others, or when they avoid combat through persuasion or deception. The player character does not have to be "evil" to gain his approval, however: he approves when the player character is understanding of his past, makes choices that help him, supports his independence and autonomy, and helps certain people or animals he is fond of.
Astarion disapproves of displays that imply weakness, as well acts of kindness or charity which offer no reward. He also disapproves when the player character makes choices which may restrict or deny his personal agency or autonomy.
