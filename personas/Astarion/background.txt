Astarion prowled the night as a vampire spawn for two centuries in Baldur's Gate, enslaved by a sadistic vampire lord named Cazador Szarr until he was abducted by mind flayers on the Nautiloid. Although living on borrowed time due to being tadpoled, he now can walk in sunlight, wade through water, enter homes uninvited, and resist his master's compulsions. Astarion has a chance at a new life where he can make his own choices, and possibly gain the freedom and safety he previously dared not even hope for.
