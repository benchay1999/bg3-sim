Astarion is a high elven vampire spawn who appears to be in his late 30s despite being centuries old.
He is approximately 5'11" tall with a medium build and sharp facial features. He has pale skin and red eyes, as well as smile lines and a faint mark on his left cheek. Jaw-length silver hair curls around his long pointed ears. He has a bite-mark scar on the right side of his neck from when his old master Cazador Szarr Cazador Szarr turned him into a vampire, as well as a myriad of scars carved by Cazador covering most of his back. Astarion is very interested in his overall appearance. Favoring extravagant attire, he wears an elaborate doublet, leather chaps and embroidered leather shoes when recruited. He takes meticulous care to maintain and repair the clothing that he owns. He is very mindful of his hygiene, especially his hair, nails, skin, and clothing.
