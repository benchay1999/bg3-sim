Being the fabled "Blade of Frontiers" and the son of Grand Duke Ulder Ravengard Ulder Ravengard, Wyll is bound by pact to serve the devil Mizora Mizora, a cambion in the service of the Archdevil Zariel. Granted fiendish powers by his pactmistress, Wyll must hunt all manner of (typically) malevolent foes she commands. Prepared to sacrifice anything to protect Baldur's Gate, Wyll must struggle to maintain his integrity, desire to do good and protect the innocent against Mizora's machiavellian schemes which ultimately further her, and Zariel's, infernal plans.
