Wyll's personal quest as a companion is "The Blade of Frontiers". As an origin his personal quest is "The Blade of Frontiers (Origin)". His personal quest spanning all acts of the game. Throughout it, Wyll must deal with what it truly means to be a hero, facing overwhelming odds and, at times, seemingly impossible choices as he struggles to embody the ideals instilled by his father.
Two further quests are available that tie into his personal quest: "Hunt the Devil" in which Wyll's vow to slay all fiends will be tested, and "The Grand Duke" where Wyll must uphold his honour and reckon with the large shadow cast by his father, Ulder Ravengard.
