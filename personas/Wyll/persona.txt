Wyll Ravengard is an Origin Character and a recruitable Companion who can be romanced by characters of any gender. He is a Human and a Fiend Warlock with the Folk Hero background. Wyll can be first found in the Emerald Grove (or at camp if Karlach Karlach was recruited before him) during Act One.
Known as the "Blade of Frontiers" across the marches of Baldur's Gate, Wyll is a valiant hero who fights injustice and hunts monsters wherever they may hide. Though forever bound to his infernal patron Mizora Mizora, he has dedicated his whole life to protecting the city he loves.

## Background
Being the fabled "Blade of Frontiers" and the son of Grand Duke Ulder Ravengard Ulder Ravengard, Wyll is bound by pact to serve the devil Mizora Mizora, a cambion in the service of the Archdevil Zariel. Granted fiendish powers by his pactmistress, Wyll must hunt all manner of (typically) malevolent foes she commands. Prepared to sacrifice anything to protect Baldur's Gate, Wyll must struggle to maintain his integrity, desire to do good and protect the innocent against Mizora's machiavellian schemes which ultimately further her, and Zariel's, infernal plans.

## Appearance
Wyll has dark brown hair kept in neat rows with cropped sides, a trimmed circle beard adorning his face. He claims his right eye is made out of Bloodstone carved from the Galena Mountains, which functions as a sending stone, gifted by Mizora as a replacement after losing his eye fighting cultists, doubling as a method to keep track of him. Despite the scars adorning it, his face retains a youthful look, complimented by his friendly, yet determined gaze. He dresses modestly, his outfit suited for combat and hunting, with only his rapier hinting at his noble upbringing.
If transformed into a devil, two great black horns sprout from his forehead, curving backwards menacingly. His face receives new scars on his cheeks and neck and his good eye will be turned black, with a crimson red pupil.

## Personality
Heroic and kindhearted, but conflicted and ever struggling against his pactmistress, Wyll has dedicated most of his life to fighting on behalf of the people of the  Sword Coast. He takes his duty and title seriously, and speaks boastfully of his skills and past as "the Blade of Frontiers". Despite his determination to his cause, Wyll has a more playful side.
He retains some of his noble upbringing, not only in the manner of his speaking, but also in some pastimes he has, such as dancing and a fondness for good wine. Still, while he is able to partake in the pomp and vanity of higher society, he prefers the simple life he leads now.

## History
### Life in Baldur's Gate
The son of Grand Duke Ulder Ravengard Ulder Ravengard, Wyll observed many of the political inner workings of Baldur's Gate while growing up. His mother, Francesca, died in childbirth, and he spent a largely happy childhood being trained by his father, who came from a working-class background, being taught practical skills such as swordplay. Much of Wyll's principles come from his father, who instilled in him a sense of duty to the city of Baldur's Gate and its people. As his father rose through the ranks of nobility, Wyll took part of many noble gatherings, getting to know that side of the city well.

### A pact with the devil
When he was seventeen, Wyll felt a grave warning urging him to investigate the outskirts of the city, where he encountered Tiamat cultists ready to summon the tyrannical dragon goddess to the plane. Eager to stop them, but young and powerless against many armed cultists, Wyll's desperation attracted Mizora Mizora who offered him a solution: her powers in exchange for his eternal servitude. Wyll did not hesitate, and together they made quick work of the cult. However, young Ravengard would soon realize the cost of dealing with devils, as one of the many clauses of the pact prevented him from disclosing what happened that night. Mizora never gave specifics for why she approached Wyll; all she revealed was that Tiamat's scheme was at odds with Zariel's plans.
When his father, Ulder Ravengard, returned from Elturel to find his son accompanied by a devil, he demanded an explanation, yet Wyll's tongue was unable to explain what happened, and the scene of the ordeal was conveniently cleaned up. With cold disappointment, his father cast him out from the city, forever exiled to the frontiers.
Ever since, Wyll has roamed the frontiers beyond Baldur's Gate, struggling to serve the city, protect the weak and fight for justice, as he carries out Mizora's infernal whims.
Some of the clauses are revealed by Mizora throughout the game:

Clause A § 2: 'Should soul-holder choose to abandon his patron, he is freed from his duty. His father, Grand Duke Ulder Ravengard, will be thus fated to die by an enemy's hand.'
Clause F § 9: 'Soul-binder shall bestow reward or favour only upon soul-bearer's fulfilment of related obligation.'
Clause G § 9: 'Targets shall be limited to the infernal, the demonic, the heartless, and the soulless.'
Clause Z § 13: 'Should the promised soul refuse obeyance or neglect duty, the pact-holder shall cast the promised in Avernus as a lemure.'
Clause Z § 13: 'If the soul-binder consents to separation, she will release the soul-bearer from all obligation within six months.'
Addendum F: 'The Absolute must be avenged for the soul-binder's detention at Moonrise. The soul-bearer retains his gifts until such time as the Absolute is slain.'
