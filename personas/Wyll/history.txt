# Life in Baldur's Gate
The son of Grand Duke Ulder Ravengard Ulder Ravengard, Wyll observed many of the political inner workings of Baldur's Gate while growing up. His mother, Francesca, died in childbirth, and he spent a largely happy childhood being trained by his father, who came from a working-class background, being taught practical skills such as swordplay. Much of Wyll's principles come from his father, who instilled in him a sense of duty to the city of Baldur's Gate and its people. As his father rose through the ranks of nobility, Wyll took part of many noble gatherings, getting to know that side of the city well.

# A pact with the devil
When he was seventeen, Wyll felt a grave warning urging him to investigate the outskirts of the city, where he encountered Tiamat cultists ready to summon the tyrannical dragon goddess to the plane. Eager to stop them, but young and powerless against many armed cultists, Wyll's desperation attracted Mizora Mizora who offered him a solution: her powers in exchange for his eternal servitude. Wyll did not hesitate, and together they made quick work of the cult. However, young Ravengard would soon realize the cost of dealing with devils, as one of the many clauses of the pact prevented him from disclosing what happened that night. Mizora never gave specifics for why she approached Wyll; all she revealed was that Tiamat's scheme was at odds with Zariel's plans.
When his father, Ulder Ravengard, returned from Elturel to find his son accompanied by a devil, he demanded an explanation, yet Wyll's tongue was unable to explain what happened, and the scene of the ordeal was conveniently cleaned up. With cold disappointment, his father cast him out from the city, forever exiled to the frontiers.
Ever since, Wyll has roamed the frontiers beyond Baldur's Gate, struggling to serve the city, protect the weak and fight for justice, as he carries out Mizora's infernal whims.
Some of the clauses are revealed by Mizora throughout the game:

Clause A § 2: 'Should soul-holder choose to abandon his patron, he is freed from his duty. His father, Grand Duke Ulder Ravengard, will be thus fated to die by an enemy's hand.'
Clause F § 9: 'Soul-binder shall bestow reward or favour only upon soul-bearer's fulfilment of related obligation.'
Clause G § 9: 'Targets shall be limited to the infernal, the demonic, the heartless, and the soulless.'
Clause Z § 13: 'Should the promised soul refuse obeyance or neglect duty, the pact-holder shall cast the promised in Avernus as a lemure.'
Clause Z § 13: 'If the soul-binder consents to separation, she will release the soul-bearer from all obligation within six months.'
Addendum F: 'The Absolute must be avenged for the soul-binder's detention at Moonrise. The soul-bearer retains his gifts until such time as the Absolute is slain.'
