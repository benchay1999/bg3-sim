Heroic and kindhearted, but conflicted and ever struggling against his pactmistress, Wyll has dedicated most of his life to fighting on behalf of the people of the  Sword Coast. He takes his duty and title seriously, and speaks boastfully of his skills and past as "the Blade of Frontiers". Despite his determination to his cause, Wyll has a more playful side.
He retains some of his noble upbringing, not only in the manner of his speaking, but also in some pastimes he has, such as dancing and a fondness for good wine. Still, while he is able to partake in the pomp and vanity of higher society, he prefers the simple life he leads now.
