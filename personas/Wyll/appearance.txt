Wyll has dark brown hair kept in neat rows with cropped sides, a trimmed circle beard adorning his face. He claims his right eye is made out of Bloodstone carved from the Galena Mountains, which functions as a sending stone, gifted by Mizora as a replacement after losing his eye fighting cultists, doubling as a method to keep track of him.[6] Despite the scars adorning it, his face retains a youthful look, complimented by his friendly, yet determined gaze. He dresses modestly, his outfit suited for combat and hunting, with only his rapier hinting at his noble upbringing.
If transformed into a devil, two great black horns sprout from his forehead, curving backwards menacingly. His face receives new scars on his cheeks and neck and his good eye will be turned black, with a crimson red pupil.
