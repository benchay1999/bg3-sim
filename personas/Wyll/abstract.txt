Wyll Ravengard is an Origin Character and a recruitable Companion[2] who can be romanced by characters of any gender. He is a Human and a Fiend Warlock with the Folk Hero background. Wyll can be first found in the Emerald Grove (or at camp if Karlach Karlach was recruited before him) during Act One.
Known as the "Blade of Frontiers" across the marches of Baldur's Gate, Wyll is a valiant hero who fights injustice and hunts monsters wherever they may hide. Though forever bound to his infernal patron Mizora Mizora, he has dedicated his whole life to protecting the city he loves.
