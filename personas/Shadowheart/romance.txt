Shadowheart can be romanced by characters of any gender, and is one of the few characters willing to have a casual relationship. Throughout it, she will have to deal with the topic of her identity and how the idea of love fits the Sharran concept of self-sacrifice for their goddess. If romanced by a Sel√ªnite cleric, Shadowheart has unique dialogue and behavior options available.
