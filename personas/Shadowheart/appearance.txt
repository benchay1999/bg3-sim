Lithe of frame, well dressed and with meticulously managed features, Shadowheart is not unattractive  and may, if mentioning this to her (e.g. if romanced), acknowledge this matter-of-factly . She has straight, coal-black hair and a long, flowing ponytail fastened in segments by elaborately crafted silver loops. Her fringe hair is kept short and straight, revealing her brows beneath and a scar running from her nose to her right cheek. Hair adorns her face on the sides, reaching past her chin, her pointed ears barely peeking through them, and her eyes, light-green with speckles of yellow, are contoured by dark make-up. Though rarely seen, she has a black circular mark on her right hand, a wound given by Shar, causing Shadowheart pain whenever she engages in behavior the Lady of Sorrows disapproves of. Though appearing youthful due to her elven heritage, she is over 40 years old.
Shadowheart complements her Sharran attire with a silver circlet worn above her fringe. It is simple, yet elegant, displaying her goddess' holy symbol, a black disc, as well as an ornate argent hairpiece at the base of her ponytail, reminiscent of the decorations found in Sharran temples.
After the events of "The Chosen of Shar", if Shadowheart turns away from Shar, she will dye her hair silver and part her fringe off-center, showing more of her forehead. If she remains faithful, however, she will maintain her black hair but part it nonetheless.
