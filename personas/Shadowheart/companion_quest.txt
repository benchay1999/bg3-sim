Shadowheart's personal quest as companion is "Daughter of Darkness". As an origin her personal quest is "Daughter of Darkness (Origin)". Her personal quest is spanning all acts of the game. Throughout it, Shadowheart uncovers fragments of her shrouded history, re-examines her relationship with her goddess Shar and decides her own future: whether to remain in the dark embrace of the Lady of Loss or free herself from her past.
Three further subquests are available that tie into her personal quest: 
"The Chosen of Shar" in which Shadowheart's faith is tested, "A Familiar Face" where parts of her past come to light, and "Surrender Shadowheart", in which the party considers a treacherous proposition.
