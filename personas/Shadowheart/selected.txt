Shadowheart (born Jenevelle Hallowleaf) is an Origin Character and a recruitable Companion who can be romanced by characters of any gender. She is a High Half-Elf and a Trickery Domain Cleric with the Acolyte background.
As a loyal servant of the goddess Shar Shar, Shadowheart can be cold and calculating, willing to do whatever is necessary to serve the Dark Lady with utter devotion.

# Background
A devout follower of the Lady of Loss, Shadowheart is the sole survivor of a holy mission undertaken on the Mistress of the Night's behest. She alone must deliver a relic of immense power to her coven in Baldur's Gate while threatened by a strange new magic that is burgeoning from within. Her faith plays an important part in her story throughout the game, and she can be steered towards or away from it.

# Appearance
Lithe of frame, well dressed and with meticulously managed features, Shadowheart is not unattractive  and may, if mentioning this to her (e.g. if romanced), acknowledge this matter-of-factly . She has straight, coal-black hair and a long, flowing ponytail fastened in segments by elaborately crafted silver loops. Her fringe hair is kept short and straight, revealing her brows beneath and a scar running from her nose to her right cheek. Hair adorns her face on the sides, reaching past her chin, her pointed ears barely peeking through them, and her eyes, light-green with speckles of yellow, are contoured by dark make-up. Though rarely seen, she has a black circular mark on her right hand, a wound given by Shar, causing Shadowheart pain whenever she engages in behavior the Lady of Sorrows disapproves of. Though appearing youthful due to her elven heritage, she is over 40 years old.
Shadowheart complements her Sharran attire with a silver circlet worn above her fringe. It is simple, yet elegant, displaying her goddess' holy symbol, a black disc, as well as an ornate argent hairpiece at the base of her ponytail, reminiscent of the decorations found in Sharran temples.
After the events of "The Chosen of Shar", if Shadowheart turns away from Shar, she will dye her hair silver and part her fringe off-center, showing more of her forehead. If she remains faithful, however, she will maintain her black hair but part it nonetheless.

# Personality
Zealously devoted, independent and headstrong, Shadowheart prefers pragmatic solutions to problems, decisive action in the face of uncertainty and remaining uninvolved in the affairs of others. While she initially seems guarded and reserved – hesitant to reveal information about herself – she is in fact amnesiac, with little memory of her own past. Fiercely devoted to Shar, she does not tolerate slights against her goddess, often reacting defensively. Trained in the Sharran ways, she is also not above forceful, ruthless actions, duplicity or even killing in order to achieve her goals.
Still, Shadowheart displays traits that are often at odds with her Sharran training. She has a fondness for flowers and animals, disapproves of indiscriminate violence, prefers relatively peaceful resolutions to conflicts when possible and often sympathizes with the plights of party members. She can be as sarcastic as Astarion Astarion and does not shy away from dark humour. She is introspective and often harbours doubts as can be seen by romancing her, and when guided away from Shar, she is much more open and honest with her feelings.

# History
## Early life
Born to parents Arnell Hallowleaf Arnell and Emmeline Hallowleaf Emmeline Hallowleaf, Jenevelle, as she was named, was raised in a Selûnite household in the forests outside Baldur's Gate. Devout followers of the Moonmaiden, they worshipped her in quiet seclusion away from the city, raising young Jenevelle in the ways of Selûne. In time, she would take part of an ancient Selûnite initiation rite: abandoned in the wilds, she would have to rely on her skills and faith to fend for herself, proving herself as a devout believer once she returned.
Yet Shar Shar, Selûne's dark sister, had other plans for the child and commanded Viconia DeVir Viconia DeVir and a cadre of Sharrans to kidnap her. Arnell had learned of this ploy after capturing a Sharran spy, and taking his wolf form, raced towards Jenevelle. But young Jenevelle never learned of her father's curse of lycanthropy, and instead of being rescued by her father, all she saw was a great wolf hunting her. The Sharrans caught up to the pair and kidnapped both, taking them to a secret cloister of the Dark Lady in Baldur's Gate.

## Life as a Sharran
Jenevelle would be brought to the Cloister of Sombre Embrace, a Sharran temple in Baldur's Gate set up and ran by Mother Superior Viconia DeVir after her previous endeavours in Waterdeep had failed. Viconia's mission, given to her directly by Shar, was to mould young Jenevelle into a champion of the Dark Lady, an effort that would ultimately take almost half a century. At first Jenevelle resisted the indoctrination, but the brutal training she would be put through, being lied to that her parents perished defending her from wolves, as well as repeated forced use of the temple's Mirror of Loss, would slowly erase her past and in time forge a new identity: Shadowheart.
The Mother Superior was especially cruel with Shadowheart, forcing her to use the Mirror of Loss more than any other acolyte. Under Viconia's watchful eye and no longer recognizing her parents, Shadowheart was forced to repeatedly torture and practice her newfound skills on them. Still, Shadowheart was able to retain a few memories from her past thanks to Rennald, a young Tiefling acolyte undergoing similar training. Any time she would be subjected to mirror training, he would do his best to remind Shadowheart who she was afterwards. Thanks to him, and whatever scattered notes Shadowheart was able to jot down between mirror trainings, Shadowheart was able to retain some parts of her own identity, such as her fondness for flowers and animals. The two became good friends, and one of the few blessings during Shadowheart's time in the cloister.

## Hunting after the mysterious artefact
At some point during Shadowheart's last stages of training, whispers of the rise of a mysterious cult reached the Mother Superior's ears. This Cult of the Absolute as it was being called, was quickly gaining traction among the populace and threatened Sharran influence over the city. As luck would have it, the Sharrans captured a Githyanki scout who, after being subjected to merciless torture, revealed the existence of a githyanki artefact of immense power such that the cult became desperate to find, lest it be used against them. Such an artefact could prove an asset for the Sharrans in thwarting the absolutist presence in the city, so the Mother Superior quickly formed a party of elite devouts, tasking them with its retrieval. Though deemed a suicide mission, Shadowheart and four other companions set out to fulfil what they believed were Shar's commands.
The group was able to locate the Mysterious Artefact though at great cost: Shadowheart was the only survivor.
Disaster would not stop there, however, as she soon found herself captive at the hands of Mind Flayers. How and where she was captured is never explored, however, and at some point during her capture she was tadpoled and imprisoned in a pod, awaiting  Ceremorphosis.

# Approval
Shadowheart prefers finding pragmatic and efficient solutions to problems. Accordingly, she appreciates discretion, creativity, and open-mindedness. She generally responds well to acts of heroism. While Shadowheart is afraid of wolves, she loves animals and will always react favourably to positive interactions with them and negatively to cruelty towards them. As a devout Sharran, Shadowheart also approves of acts against Selûne Selûne and Selûnites in general.
Shadowheart greatly values her privacy. She dislikes those who pry for details on her personal life, her faith or (should they learn of it) disapprove of her worship of Shar, as well as those who press for responses to questions she has already declined to answer. Shadowheart also has has a dry, witty, cynical, and often biting sense of humor, which may soften somewhat towards the player character if she is romanced. She does not like needless cruelty or violence and can respond unfavourably to others being too open with untrustworthy or unknown individuals. Straying from Shar's mandates results in Shadowheart being punished through the wound in her right hand, a reminder to follow Shar Shar's wishes.
