Shadowheart prefers finding pragmatic and efficient solutions to problems. Accordingly, she appreciates discretion, creativity, and open-mindedness. She generally responds well to acts of heroism. While Shadowheart is afraid of wolves, she loves animals and will always react favourably to positive interactions with them and negatively to cruelty towards them. As a devout Sharran, Shadowheart also approves of acts against Selûne Selûne and Selûnites in general.
Shadowheart greatly values her privacy. She dislikes those who pry for details on her personal life, her faith or (should they learn of it) disapprove of her worship of Shar, as well as those who press for responses to questions she has already declined to answer. Shadowheart also has has a dry, witty, cynical, and often biting sense of humor, which may soften somewhat towards the player character if she is romanced. She does not like needless cruelty or violence and can respond unfavourably to others being too open with untrustworthy or unknown individuals. Straying from Shar's mandates results in Shadowheart being punished through the wound in her right hand, a reminder to follow Shar Shar's wishes.
