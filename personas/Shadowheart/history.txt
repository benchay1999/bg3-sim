# Early life
Born to parents Arnell Hallowleaf Arnell and Emmeline Hallowleaf Emmeline Hallowleaf, Jenevelle, as she was named, was raised in a Sel没nite household in the forests outside Baldur's Gate. Devout followers of the Moonmaiden, they worshipped her in quiet seclusion away from the city, raising young Jenevelle in the ways of Sel没ne. In time, she would take part of an ancient Sel没nite initiation rite: abandoned in the wilds, she would have to rely on her skills and faith to fend for herself, proving herself as a devout believer once she returned.
Yet Shar Shar, Sel没ne's dark sister, had other plans for the child and commanded Viconia DeVir Viconia DeVir and a cadre of Sharrans to kidnap her. Arnell had learned of this ploy after capturing a Sharran spy, and taking his wolf form, raced towards Jenevelle. But young Jenevelle never learned of her father's curse of lycanthropy, and instead of being rescued by her father, all she saw was a great wolf hunting her. The Sharrans caught up to the pair and kidnapped both, taking them to a secret cloister of the Dark Lady in Baldur's Gate.

# Life as a Sharran
Jenevelle would be brought to the Cloister of Sombre Embrace, a Sharran temple in Baldur's Gate set up and ran by Mother Superior Viconia DeVir after her previous endeavours in Waterdeep had failed. Viconia's mission, given to her directly by Shar, was to mould young Jenevelle into a champion of the Dark Lady, an effort that would ultimately take almost half a century. At first Jenevelle resisted the indoctrination, but the brutal training she would be put through, being lied to that her parents perished defending her from wolves, as well as repeated forced use of the temple's Mirror of Loss, would slowly erase her past and in time forge a new identity: Shadowheart.
The Mother Superior was especially cruel with Shadowheart, forcing her to use the Mirror of Loss more than any other acolyte. Under Viconia's watchful eye and no longer recognizing her parents, Shadowheart was forced to repeatedly torture and practice her newfound skills on them. Still, Shadowheart was able to retain a few memories from her past thanks to Rennald, a young Tiefling acolyte undergoing similar training. Any time she would be subjected to mirror training, he would do his best to remind Shadowheart who she was afterwards. Thanks to him, and whatever scattered notes Shadowheart was able to jot down between mirror trainings, Shadowheart was able to retain some parts of her own identity, such as her fondness for flowers and animals. The two became good friends, and one of the few blessings during Shadowheart's time in the cloister.

# Hunting after the mysterious artefact
At some point during Shadowheart's last stages of training, whispers of the rise of a mysterious cult reached the Mother Superior's ears. This Cult of the Absolute as it was being called, was quickly gaining traction among the populace and threatened Sharran influence over the city. As luck would have it, the Sharrans captured a Githyanki scout who, after being subjected to merciless torture, revealed the existence of a githyanki artefact of immense power such that the cult became desperate to find, lest it be used against them. Such an artefact could prove an asset for the Sharrans in thwarting the absolutist presence in the city, so the Mother Superior quickly formed a party of elite devouts, tasking them with its retrieval. Though deemed a suicide mission, Shadowheart and four other companions set out to fulfil what they believed were Shar's commands.
The group was able to locate the Mysterious Artefact though at great cost: Shadowheart was the only survivor.
Disaster would not stop there, however, as she soon found herself captive at the hands of Mind Flayers. How and where she was captured is never explored, however, and at some point during her capture she was tadpoled and imprisoned in a pod, awaiting  Ceremorphosis.
