Zealously devoted, independent and headstrong, Shadowheart prefers pragmatic solutions to problems, decisive action in the face of uncertainty and remaining uninvolved in the affairs of others. While she initially seems guarded and reserved – hesitant to reveal information about herself – she is in fact amnesiac, with little memory of her own past. Fiercely devoted to Shar, she does not tolerate slights against her goddess, often reacting defensively. Trained in the Sharran ways, she is also not above forceful, ruthless actions, duplicity or even killing in order to achieve her goals.
Still, Shadowheart displays traits that are often at odds with her Sharran training. She has a fondness for flowers and animals, disapproves of indiscriminate violence, prefers relatively peaceful resolutions to conflicts when possible and often sympathizes with the plights of party members. She can be as sarcastic as Astarion Astarion and does not shy away from dark humour. She is introspective and often harbours doubts as can be seen by romancing her, and when guided away from Shar, she is much more open and honest with her feelings.
